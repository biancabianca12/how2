I never thought about trying to actually         fabricate one  it seemed impossible, and I was very much charmed by its         seeming impossibility. It was one of its most magnetic qualities. Id         created a conceptual book. A book that I was drawn to think about and         imagine from time to time, even occasionally mentioning it or discussing         it within the circle of friends I had, most of whom were photographers         or painters. In my dream the book consisted of a <a href="../glassbook/pages/text-1_jpg.htm"><img src="../glassbook/thumbnails/text-1_jpg.jpg" width="133" height="200" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" border="0"></a>stack         of glass pages with text sandblasted onto them. The book resembled a cube         of ice into which some letters and words seemed to be incised all the         way through, and I visualized that when the pages of the book were turned,         parts of the text transformed, or disappeared.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A few months         before I went to Oaxaca, Mexico for the first time, I wrote instructions         to myself in my notebook about how to write the &quot;book&quot;:</font></p>      <dir>         <p>        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the           glass book Ive been thinking about for 12 years is a poem written </font>back           to front, each page bearing an addition of words that will add <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">up           to the beginning (book closed) &quot;full&quot; poem  </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&lt;light           plus light equals light&gt;</font></p>      </dir>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><a href="../glassbook/pages/text-2_jpg.htm"><img src="../glassbook/thumbnails/text-2_jpg.jpg" width="134" height="200" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10" border="0"></a>After         receiving a one-year grant for poetry from the Gerbode Foundation in 1993         I moved to Oaxaca, Mexico. I began to compose the poem, not back to front,         but paying close attention to how the words accumulated &amp; could be         divided, &amp; whether or not there would appear to be enough of a shift         in weight and image if letters or parts of words or phrases were taken         away. I wrote a lot; I scrapped a lot of that writing. The poem finally         came. </font></p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In         retrospect, it echoes my journey from San Francisco to my arrival in Oaxaca.         The book begins with the full poem on its<a href="../glassbook/pages/text-3_jpg.htm"><img src="../glassbook/thumbnails/text-3_jpg.jpg" width="134" height="200" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" border="0"></a>         top page, a &quot;description&quot; of a dense landscape, which with the         turn of pages loses mass and weight, loses cragginess and darkness, until         only the words &quot;air air wind sky&quot; are spread out across the         glass page. I had dreamed of a poem as a glass book, a transparent object         made of text, frozen onto/into its pages through which one could view         the external world, in constant motion, passing, and through which the         world, in constant motion, could enter. Id dreamed of it as being a way         of entering an indefinite place through language that appears and disappears,         mirroring its own poetic process. Upon reaching the final page the book         no longer exists, except as a filter. </font></p>      <p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><a href="../glassbook/pages/text-4_jpg.htm"><img src="../glassbook/thumbnails/text-4_jpg.jpg" width="132" height="200" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10" border="0"></a>Making         the book was pure exploration. My first prototypes were hilarious failures.         I was not interested in fabricating a prototype from acetate or plexiglass         because plastic has no qualities, and scratches easily. My first attempt         consisted of trying to apply black rub-on type, letter by letter, with         a burnishing tool. This was painstaking work and took hours. When I finally         got to the 2nd line some of the letters from the 1st line began to slide         off the glass page. This made me delirious, and I thought of the Berrigan         / Hollo joke about &quot;words sliding off the page.&quot; </font></p>      <p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         enlisted the help of a friend and graphic artist who lives in Oaxaca and         asked him to make a computer-generated silkscreen for printing the glass.         We agreed that the best way to do it was to work backwards  consequently         each &quot;page&quot; would be silkscreened from <a href="../glassbook/pages/text-5_jpg.htm"><img src="../glassbook/thumbnails/text-5_jpg.jpg" width="200" height="131" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" border="0"></a>underneath.         This would allow the glass surface to have more of a visual impact even         from the top page. Also, each page had to be screened with the full poem         so that the spacing wouldnt change from one page to the next, despite         parts of the text disappearing. We decided on a typeface and using flush-right         instead of flush-left margins, so that the shape of the text remaining         on each page would be visually more balanced. After the glass had been         silkscreened we fashioned &quot;word-removal <a href="../glassbook/pages/text-6_jpg.htm"><img src="../glassbook/thumbnails/text-6_jpg.jpg" width="134" height="200" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10" border="0"></a>tools&quot;         from wooden sticks with which we could remove words or parts of words         from subsequent pages. Then each completed page had to be baked in an         oven to render the ink permanent. Each step of this project involved language,         from inception to completion, from the writing of the poem to my self-induced         crash course on how to communicate what I needed, in Spanish, and at times         in a more technically oriented Spanish. Even sitting around the table         scratching off letters and removing words and the amazing conversation         that ensued around those concepts became an integral component of the         glass book. We were both completely exhilarated with each finished page.         The lamplight over the table where we worked performed magic, refracting         through the finished stack and bouncing off its glass edges. And something         else happened: with the handling of the glass, the book took on other         qualities  reflections and areas that resembled oil slicks. The oils         from our fingertips <a href="../glassbook/pages/text-7_jpg.htm"><img src="../glassbook/thumbnails/text-7_jpg.jpg" width="200" height="130" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" border="0"></a>actually         &quot;scattered&quot; the light, and instead of light passing through         darkness, darkness passes through light, and in that process, colors are         produced. The entire making of the book involved what I felt was the ultimate         synthesis of language, philosophy and art, each of which was addressed         in both Spanish and English, and all of which seemed to wholly represent         the accumulation of many ideas and moments leading up to and including         that elusive continuous present. </font></p>      <hr>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>BIO:         </b> Thanks to a 1993 Gerbode Foundation Award in Poetry, Laurie Price         moved from San Francisco to Oaxaca, Mexico where she wrote and worked         on a series of 'literary art objects.'
