        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Gail 
          Scott’s new novel <i>My Paris</i> poses simultaneously as a travel diary, 
          a city guide, and a collection of “ends of sentences.” A palimpsest of 
          the postcolonial metropolis on Gertrude Stein’s mythologized City of Light, 
          the novel also tangos with the work of German writer and theorist Walter 
          Benjamin (1892-1940), who described Paris’s 19th-century shopping arcades 
          and the <i>flâneur</i> (an idle urban stroller) in a unique analytic style. 
          The narrator’s own experiences strolling through Paris are juxtaposed 
          with and subvert her preconceptions about the city and about travel in 
          general. Gail Scott’s previous books include the novels <i>Heroine</i> 
          and <i>Main Brides</i> and the short story collection <i>Spare Parts</i>. 
          She is also a founding editor of <i>Spirale</i>, a French-language cultural 
          journal, and <i>Tessera</i>, a bilingual journal of women’s writing. We 
          met in a Mile-End café and our meandering conversation was reminiscent 
          of Benjamin’s own montage of quotations, discursively touring the gray 
          areas between travel and anti-travel, gay and straight, subject and object, 
          equality and conformity, and between one century and the next.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Intertexts</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Let’s start with B: Walter 
          Benjamin. Tell me about his influence on <i>My Paris</i>.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Both [Gertrude] Stein 
          and Benjamin stroll through <i>My Paris</i> as literary ghosts. Benjamin 
          is there in a particularly intimate way, almost a friend or lover whom 
          she calls B and whose Arcades Project [<i>Paris: Capitale du XIXe siécle</i>] 
          she reads in bed every morning. It becomes a site map for her exploration 
          of Paris, but more than that, the work starts to infuse her way of thinking. 
          The Arcades Project is actually a huge pile of detritus, 19th-century 
          quotes and anecdotes, put together in a series of montages. Benjamin was 
          looking for a way to write a history based on found objects, juxtaposed 
          in unexpected or contradictory ways, in order to continually challenge 
          the biases of both the historian and the reader. The point was to make 
          the historian, as a writing subject, not disappear but become a construction 
          of the whole. <i>My Paris</i> isn’t exactly a montage, but in a way the 
          diary form is a montage, like it or not. It’s discontinuous. Sometimes 
          things are juxtaposed in a shocking manner. For example the action in 
          the men’s clothing shop window across from her studio on boulevard Raspail, 
          always changing. There’s almost more action in shop windows than in real 
          life.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Those juxtapositions really 
          struck me, like Bambi going by on the bus. They’re brilliant: very disruptive 
          of the expected trajectory of narrative. Which came first, the idea for 
          the novel, or your interest in the Arcades Project?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Well, to answer sort of 
          anecdotally, somebody gave me the book as a present and I went to Paris 
          with it. And I wrote a diary, but all the time I was reading Walter Benjamin. 
          At first I thought the diary would be a straightforward travel diary. 
          But a so-called straightforward travel diary—there are tons of them around 
          these days—features an essentially 19th century traveller: the One sucking 
          up the exoticism of the Other. The old Imperialist model. Certainly that 
          long careful reading I did of Benjamin in Paris showed me other narrative 
          options. As reading Stein suggests other syntactical options. But whatever 
          is learned from Benjamin or Stein gets subsumed into the artistic needs 
          of the late 90s diary and character. The dead authors become traces in 
          the work, clashing with new technologies and life in the streets now, 
          which is both the same as and very different from life in the streets 
          when they wrote. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Had you been interested 
          in Benjamin before?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Oh yeah. I’ve been reading 
          Benjamin for a long long time, ever since I was in the Left in the 70s. 
          He’s somebody who really understood that place between Marxism and what 
          they call the superstructure or means of production of culture, which 
          I don’t think many Marxists really understood. He understood it without 
          having to reject Marxism altogether. Or some kind of leftist thinking, 
          not necessarily orthodox Marxism. Benjamin’s also in <i>Main Brides</i>, 
          there are references to him. As a left person and later a feminist, I 
          learned from writers like Benjamin and the Surrealists how to remain fluid 
          in my thinking, to learn from these crucial movements without conceding, 
          artistically, to the dogmatism that political movements, with their particular 
          tasks, run the eternal risk of projecting.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> What about the flâneur. 
          According to Benjamin, the flâneur as a historical persona vanished with 
          the advent of modernism, but continued to be a rich allegorical figure. 
          The narrator in <i>My Paris</i> is a flâneuse of sorts, but doesn’t feel 
          comfortable in that role either. Do you see the flâneur as a useful figure 
          for interpreting the contemporary city, or is it too problematic today?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> One interesting thing 
          in the Arcades Project is that the flâneur has to find a means of economic 
          survival at some point... The first flâneurs in 19th-century Paris were 
          the sons of rich men protesting Daddy’s money—made on the backs of factory 
          workers in the industrial revolution—by leaning against walls, wearing 
          cloaks lined with scarlet. One incarnation of the flâneur was the dandy, 
          who was picking up boys, mostly. The Oscar Wilde figure is a classic flâneur. 
          But Benjamin points out that at a certain point the flâneur has to start 
          surviving so he becomes a journalist and sells his observations; thus 
          the flâneur becomes a complete mockery of what he represented in the beginning: 
          resistance/flaunting representation of the increasing monotony of capitalism.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> You can’t escape economics.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Right. But I still hear 
          people talking about flânerie in Paris and it just strikes me as being 
          completely ludicrous. A professor on sabbatical, or a person on their 
          junior year abroad, or a writer, like myself, who gets a grant to a very 
          comfortable studio, does not represent, unless she finds some very original 
          way to live, the spirit of resistance and enforced marginality that the 
          early flâneur aimed for. The flâneur flaunted his sloth in an insulting 
          manner. Another point that Benjamin makes, that then gets juxtaposed on 
          my own text, is who are the real flâneurs today? In Paris they’re the 
          homeless people looking for cobblestones that aren’t too bumpy to sleep 
          on. Or the sans papiers, refugees. Those are the flâneurs today.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> There are certain words 
          from Benjamin that you fix on and use repeatedly, like physiognomy. What 
          does that mean for you in the text?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> That’s a hard question, 
          partly because the face in the crowd is one of the things I go back to 
          again and again in my work, without getting to the bottom. <i>Main Brides</i> 
          might be considered, on some level, an obsession with the face of the 
          stranger. Anyway, there is the notion that the flâneur collects physiognomies. 
          And inasmuch as [the narrator] has residues of this desire to be a flâneur 
          I guess physiognomies are one of the things that she tries to collect, 
          except it’s always so fleeting. I think some of her most successful attempts 
          to do that are with faces she sees on TV. She certainly has a romantic 
          idea when she gets to Paris that she’s going to be this flâneur, but she 
          just doesn’t know where to go. She doesn’t know how to do it. She’s too 
          timid, whimsical. Spends hours getting dressed to get lost in the crowd. 
          Goes into cafés and looks at herself in the mirror, or looks at other 
          people looking at themselves in the mirror, instead of actually walking 
          around looking into faces and saying, I can tell a whole story from that 
          face.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Whimsical is another resonant 
          word. The flâneur is whimsical, and the narrator seems modelled on that.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Was the flâneur whimsical? 
          I don’t think so. I think the flâneur took himself very seriously. And 
          that’s precisely what she can’t do.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> There are references in 
          the novel, for example, to the flâneur walking a tortoise in the arcades, 
          and Benjamin has a quote about Nerval with a lobster on a leash. That’s 
          the kind of whimsy I’m talking about.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> But I think the difference, 
          and this is the difference between the 19th century and now, is that the 
          flâneur had a kind of ironic stance, the flâneur’s flaunting of himself 
          in his outfit was very ironic, and I think that’s very 19th-century and 
          it requires someone who considers themselves a fairly well-constituted 
          subject. Whereas this character is not ironic, she’s parodic. She’s in 
          a different space—and we never know whether she doesn’t make it as a full 
          subject because she doesn’t know how, or if, as she implies, she’s making 
          herself minuscule, inconsequential, the better to not over-influence her 
          story with her own subjectivity. In fact, the flâneur is lost in the crowd 
          but is also in full control of his own individuality, Benjamin says. And 
          that’s different from her clownish, Chaplinesque posture. Which is far 
          more deconstructed in a way.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> More of an object than 
          a subject?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> I think she marks a place 
          where, in interesting prose today, which is not much prose [laughing], 
          the subject has gotten displaced—between the subject and the object as 
          opposed to being here, with the object over there. The whimsy has to do 
          with that.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Alright. Now GS: the review 
          in <i>The Globe and Mail</i> calls you a Québecoise Gertrude Stein. What 
          do you think?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Well, I think that the 
          person writing that review of the book didn’t get it. She didn’t get the 
          fact that the narrator of the book has in fact a love-hate relationship 
          with everything Stein and the expatriates represented. On one hand she 
          totally admires Stein’s work. And I do think Stein is one of the greatest 
          20th-century writers. But at the same time she doesn’t want to have the 
          kind of relationship to the world around her that these people had—they 
          seemed to be defined to some extent by what was happening in the expatriate 
          milieu, or bounded by it. The problems of others, the economic situation 
          of ordinary Parisians, for example, rarely comes up as an issue. [James] 
          Baldwin, not surprisingly, was an exception. The Globe and Mail reviewer 
          didn’t see the parody.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> What is it about Gertrude 
          Stein’s relationship to the world around her that you find problematic?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> There is Stein the persona 
          and there is the writing. We can reframe with hindsight the limitations 
          of her vision, her republican enthusiasm. Basically, Stein noticed that 
          the Americans, in inventing the automobile, were inventing the 20th century, 
          but she didn’t notice the Imperialist payback. I mean, the automobile 
          is a very fraught sign for everything that was to come after. It’s true: 
          it changed our world. It changed our lives, provided us with tremendous 
          mobility. But, will the planet be around a century from now, given the 
          automobile? So that’s not a useful trope anymore. At the same time, the 
          way the automobile moves, and even the way it is produced, were picked 
          up in Stein’s sentences. Her ability to see how extraordinary that invention 
          was as a defining element of her epoch helped her revolutionize narration.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Another intertext is from 
          Balzac: the narrator’s favourite Balzac heroine is <i>The Girl with the 
          Golden Eyes</i>. Why is that character important to her?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Well, she’s like that 
          person in a way. I mean, she would love to live this cloistered life where 
          someone else takes care of her. At the same time, the Balzac heroine has 
          a kind of split desire: she’s sequestered by the Marquise and likes that 
          a lot but at the same time she desires the Tom who’s prowling around the 
          tuileries and running after her.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> She’s between hetero- 
          and homo-sexuality.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Right. And I think the 
          character in this book, she’s not bisexual by any means, but she’s (a) 
          trying to avoid categories all the time, and (b) phenomenally interested 
          in the question of exotic beauty which for her the Balzac heroine represents.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> There’s a really Orientalist 
          portrayal of her in the Balzac story. By identifying with the girl with 
          the golden eyes, is the narrator trying to turn herself into an exotic, 
          Orientalized object, a figure from “the South?”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> She might desire to make 
          herself an Orientalized figure. I certainly don’t think she succeeds. 
          I think she probably does have some desire to do that.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> It’s interesting that 
          there’s a slippage for the Western subject from desiring that Orientalized 
          figure to desiring to become that figure.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Right. But without any 
          of the inconveniences of being that figure. Because she doesn’t want to 
          be deported, she doesn’t want to live like the Algerians in Paris, or 
          First Nations people here, or young Africans, whom the police see as perpetual 
          culprits. She wants to live in her nice surroundings. I mean that’s one 
          of her contradictions—in some ways she’s a very typical Western traveller.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Mmm. What about Canadians 
          in Paris? While writing this novel, or in general, do you feel a connection 
          to Canadian expats such as Mavis Gallant or John Glassco? That tradition?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Certainly not Mavis Gallant. 
          I think she’s an important writer, but I don’t think she belongs to the 
          same current in writing as I do. Wherever I go and whatever I do, I’m 
          always looking for this thing that I think of as being about subversion, 
          contradiction. The writer through her story-telling proposes new ways 
          of seeing. Every writer does this in some way. But some choose the more 
          direct, witnessing end of the scale, in terms of intention. I love John 
          Glassco’s book about Paris [<i>Memoirs of Montparnasse</i>] but I don’t 
          really identify with it either. Partly because he comes from the “other 
          Montreal” I suppose. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> A colleague, Justin Edwards, 
          pointed out to me that John Glassco constructs and perpetuates the “Lost 
          Generation” myth without ever talking about being gay. Mavis Gallant also 
          mythologizes Paris, and while she’s never come out as a lesbian, that 
          seems to be a submerged theme in some of her stories. <i>My Paris</i> 
          is somehow similar to but the opposite of their writing in that it “outs” 
          that experience of Paris.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Right. I would agree with 
          that. But I also think that <i>My Paris</i> is a quest for something else 
          that comes from a whole political tradition that I don’t think either 
          of those writers are interested in, from what I can see.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> I found the way the intertexts 
          are introduced really interesting. You refer to Walter Benjamin early 
          on, then you start to call him B. Just as all the friends are named P, 
          S, C, etc. That really integrates him into the social sphere. So I was 
          wondering, while you were writing this book, how did you experience that 
          relationship to these other texts?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> The narrator, as she becomes 
          more and more intimate with Benjamin, reduces him to B. She also provides 
          him with a double, her friend R from Winnipeg who looks like B. But her 
          almost porous, inconsequential persona makes her incapable of real relationships—until 
          the coda when she redoes the whole city in a fast take as a lover. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> So there’s a kind of confusion 
          between the experience of the text you’re reading, the Benjamin text,

        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Oh absolutely. In that

          it’s very much a site of exploration for her, and a means of escape. She 
          lives in the Waikiki Tourist Rooms, after all. In <i>Main Brides</i>,

          Well, first of all it was the luck of the draw because I won this studio. 
          The leisure-lottery studio, her friends called it. But Paris for many 
          many reasons. First of all, I think Paris belongs to the Western world. 
          I mean you can’t look at Western 20th-century literature—until the advent 
          of post-colonialism and the rise of minority culture writing—and not trace 
          it directly or indirectly, to something that happened in France—the Surrealists, 
          New Wave film, post-structuralism etc., May ‘68 was phenomenally important, 
          Kurt Schwitters, all that stuff. So Paris in Western culture is huge. 
          To me it makes a lot of sense to go there. London doesn’t do that for 
          me personally. I just don’t see another single city like Paris in terms 
          of being able to look back at the century and see what’s happened in the 
          “tradition” of white avant-garde writing.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> So you feel a part of 
          the Western tradition that is centred in Paris...</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> I feel a part of the, 
          for want of a better word, avant-garde tradition (that’s an oxymoron), 
          which has roots in Paris. I don’t think it’s centred in Paris anymore. 
          Paris is too expensive to produce the kind of easy-going excitement that 
          the great exchange rates produced for writers in the 30s and 40s. That’s 
          why you’re in Montréal now, right? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Right. It’s cheap. That’s 
          one reason. In the book, though, the narrator doesn’t really come in contact 
          with those roots that she’s ostensibly looking for.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> No, she doesn’t. Well, 
          she does between the covers of books and in occasional conversations. 
          I mean, she can walk through the neighbourhood. She lives in one of the 
          neighbourhoods that Proust lived in. Right around the corner from Gertrude 
          Stein. Joyce lived half a block down. So she’s kind of surrounded. At 
          the same time, contemporary Paris, with its huge minority communities, 
          and the endless influx of refugees, upsets the romantic notions of Paris 
          completely, including the notion implicit in the word “roots.” That’s 
          the weird thing about Paris. It’s completely packed with history, beauty, 
          memories, references, all the time. And yet, as in all major metropolises, 
          survival is really the outstanding issue. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> According to the mayor 
          quoted in the novel you need at least $4,000 a month to live there.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Yeah. Even then. I mean, 
          part of her thing about going to Paris, because she’s gay, is that she 
          wants to find her “women of the left bank.” And who were they in the 20s 
          or the 30s? They were people who had tons of money or had friends who 
          had tons of money. None of the women she meets on the left bank have two 
          cents to rub together. They’re all, virtually, blue-collar workers. Most 
          of them have been through various struggles, various left-wing struggles—in 
          Paris some women still walk around in peaked caps! It’s just not the Paris 
          of expatriate writing any more at all.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> One aspect of the travel 
          experience in the novel is constant paranoia. The imperative of passing 
          as a native, as a Parisian. Do you think that’s a universal feature of 
          travel, or is it a part of the post-colonial, centre-periphery dynamic? 
          Does going to Paris from Canada involve searching for colonial roots?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> I think, for one thing, 
          she makes it very clear in the book that she’s not authentic Québecoise. 
          So she’s not searching for roots in the way a total francophone would 
          be searching for roots and for whom that’s no joke because it’s the one 
          place on Earth that nourishes the language of the francophonie—nourishes 
          and at the same time mocks writing/language from the so-called margins. 
          But that culture is necessary for the survival of this Québécois culture. 
          She’s presented as a kind of half-and-half person who is looking more 
          for a literary tradition than she is for a language. The post-colonial 
          thing—I wanted to play a little bit with the whole business of being Canadian 
          and travelling. I remember when I was a student and travelling in Eastern 
          Europe, I naively thought people would be nice to me when they learned 
          I was from Canada. But they just said, oh, like America! And I protested. 
          No! No! But the Canadian thing is so contradictory. First of all it’s 
          this business of being a non-nation that can’t seem to coalesce into what 
          a republic represents. What is a republic? The French Revolution, for 
          example, was in theory about equalizing subjects, protecting them so that 
          each person could stand as an individual in Liberty, Fraternity, whatever.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> The preservation of our 
          Western concept of individuality, essentially.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Exactly. In Canada we 
          buy into that and at the same time we pretend we don’t. On the one hand 
          we’re the vertical mosaic and on the other there’s this constant struggle 
          for the dominance of one culture over another. Canadian history just crawls 
          with appalling incidents of that. So how does an anglo-Québécoise situate 
          herself in travel? I saw this person as having a literary mission, a writing 
          mission. So the place she could situate herself was in sentences. Not 
          anywhere else. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Not in a nationality certainly. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> No. So then the question 
          is what kind of sentences. Which is why there’s this constant examination 
          of Stein’s sentences with their big subject sucking up all the action 
          generated by predicates. Again, Gertrude Stein said that the sentences 
          were kind of like automobiles going across a landscape. So here’s this 
          other person who comes not only from Canada but from Québec. You know: 
          the whole question of nation-state, complete disaster. And in Québec even 
          more than in the rest of Canada there is a strong republican desire. On 
          one hand she’s appalled that it takes so much military hardware to prop 
          up this notion of the individual—which we don’t see in Canada, everyone 
          knows that our military is a joke—and on the other hand she’s very wary 
          of creating, in her writing, the strongly bounded subject which in a sense 
          is the literary equivalent of republicanism. So she’s looking for something 
          else. And that’s why her sentences get smaller and smaller. With present 
          participles which are kind of a way of looking backwards and forwards 
          at the same time but not necessarily going anywhere. Maybe it’s in answer 
          to that Globe and Mail review [by Stan Persky, of <i>Main Brides</i>] 
          which said, you know, there’s no action in this novel. So here I invented 
          a sentence where, really, nothing happens. I think that the desire to 
          make herself small enough to take in the world in a way that she considers 
          acceptable as a traveller—to get back to the post-colonial thing—acknowledges 
          her own failures and her country’s failures to be non-racist. She somehow 
          thinks if she can make herself small and porous enough she’ll be able 
          to empathize with everything, every aspect of life in contemporary Paris. 
          Maybe find a different way to narrate this. At the same time, she’s aware 
          of the impossibility and hypocrisy of her own situation. Because while 
          she tries to become smaller and more absorbant, eventually she ceases 
          to exist as a person. And the less bounded she tries to be, the more paranoid 
          she gets. She never gets laid in Paris, not the first trip. And when she 
          returns with a lover, she doesn’t see the city. It’s all fogged in. As 
          if she can’t find her place as a subject. And in this book, the difficulty 
          of achieving subject status has little to do with feminism. I mean I’ve 
          learned things from feminism that I’ve applied, but here the focus is 
          not feminism at all.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> Hm. It surprises me to 
          hear you say that. But we’ll get to that in a few minutes. I want to ask 
          you more about republicanism. At first I thought the observations about 
          republicans were incidental, but then I realized that in fact republicanism 
          is fundamental to neo-Imperialism. Could the drive to assert one’s individuality—one’s 
          sovereignty—ultimately lead to Imperialism?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Well that seems to be 
          the contemporary version but don’t forget that some of the greatest Imperialists 
          of all were the Brits. Contemporaneously, there is no doubt that America 
          rules the world. Small-r republicanism, which she refers to in the novel 
          when she talks about Benjamin talking about Poe’s “Man of the Crowd”—the 
          dangers of a notion of Equality where everyone is the same—is a metaphor 
          for the endless thrust of the Imperial power towards hegemony of ideas 
          and culture. But then, since there’s always a contradiction, if you look 
          at the United States, it’s remarkably multi-cultural, increasingly so. 
          Developments that perhaps point to the new millennium.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> If America or France as 
          republics have this government-sanctioned sense of individuality, a unified 
          self, does that make Canada, as a non-national country without the same 
          unified identity, a more suitable place for writing a de-centered, post-modern 
          subject? Or is that just an excuse for finding our own sort of agency 
          in post-modernism?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Or the whatever-comes-after-post-modern. 
          Well, one would like to think it might. So far, there is not a lot of 
          evidence for that in the Canadian novel. I think Canadians have a very 
          fraught relationship with this stuff. I mean the narrator talks sometimes 
          about how she likes the present participle because she can look backwards 
          and look forwards at the same time. But she has problems staying in the 
          present. She’s always got one foot in the 19th century. And hopefully 
          one in the 21st. In Canada, we haven’t had a bourgeois revolution. We 
          missed that stage somehow. Unfortunately, instead of looking forward to 
          new possibilities, we are hopelessly nostalgic for some kind of dominance 
          of a “national dream” that only suits part of the population: not Québec; 
          not First Nations people, among others.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> That’s why you say Canada 
          has a 19th-century mentality.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Yes. But in a way what 
          I’m trying to say in the book is: all you can do is put little things 
          together. You can’t come up with big answers. So as soon as she puts something 
          together she finds another element that contradicts that, and that changes 
          what came before and what comes after. A huge puzzle...</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Anti-Travel</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> One curious thing in the 
          novel is the way you use bold typefaces. All the place names, for example, 
          the cafés, the famous buildings, the legendary bars, are in bold—in other 
          words it’s dressed up like a travel guide. But it’s also antithetical 
          to that. Is that a comment on travel guides, or travel in general?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Well, in a way it could 
          be a travel guide, I think. I mean it won’t turn up anything fantastically 
          exciting. A café here, a café there. But actually with the bold text I 
          was also thinking of old surrealist books which would occasionally put 
          words in bold. Often in documents from that period people would put, not 
          necessarily place names, but various things in bold. Because they were 
          very interested in signs. It over-emphasizes that words are just signs, 
          everything is a sign. So the signs that are literally signs, the place 
          names, get to be signed twice.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> It’s funny because the 
          premise of a travel guide is that a travel experience can be replicated. 
          That one person can write about their trip, and then another person can 
          read it and, by following the instructions, have a similar experience. 
          Whereas the novel is so much about not having the experience you expected. 
          I mean, Benjamin attempted to write a history in montage in order to disrupt 
          linear thinking, but you took his history as a kind of travel guide. And 
          because this guide is so disconnected, so aleatory, it disrupts the narrative 
          of travel, the idea of travel as a story that can be re-lived by others.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> Well, it kind of raises 
          the problem of direct representation, which we know from reading old travel 
          guides—and you and Dana [Bath] know from the work you’ve been doing with 
          travel writing—is incredibly problematic. I think one reason it took me 
          so long to write this book was that I had to find a way to write it that 
          really evacuated (to use a Gallicism) as much as possible that issue of 
          who speaks. Travel writing can never be representational. You know, the 
          best travel book I ever read, I can’t remember the name of it, but it’s 
          by a British woman who rides a horse through the mountains of Andalusia, 
          and the whole book is about her relationship with this old nag that she 
          got cheated on when she bought it somewhere in Spain. It’s perfect.</font></p>

          using unusual grammar, grammar that questions the subject/object relationship 
          in the sentence—as a conduit for questioning the same relationship in 
          travel writing. Ultimately it’s more satisfactory, for me—and, I hope, 
          the reader. So that’s what happened. In the studio, she travels as much 
          on TV as she does in the city of Paris. Which she already thinks she knows 
          from all the books she’s read, all the TV programmes, all the movies. 
          So one of the issues is, if people travel to have experiences, well, experiences 
          are not that easy to have, especially in a place like Paris that’s been 
          so mythologized already. I experience Paris more like techno music or 
          something—coming at you all over the place. And for me the whole question 
          in writing <i>My Paris</i> was how to put the writing subject in a posture 
          that would allow her to take in the city as densely as possible and at 
          the same time juxtapose that against her hackneyed ideas, expectations, 
          and very privileged white Westerner travel possibilities, you know, that 
          other people don’t have. She’s walking around aware that people without 
          papers are trying to not get thrown out of the country, because they’ve 
          escaped from some war somewhere in Africa, or from Eastern Europe. People 
          are jumping into the Seine because they don’t have the proper identity 
          papers or they’re hiding behind posts in the subway at 5:30 in the morning 
          while they sneak off to their under-paid exploitative job. So I mean,

          The exotic and new experience is getting harder and harder to find. The 
          question here is more about how we are in relationship to community, country, 
          gender, world. Something is breaking down. Identity is becoming a parody 
          of itself as people drift and merge in new cultures. Virilio says the 
          real nomads in the 21st century will be the poor, the people without countries, 
          etc. We already see this in cities like Paris. The rich will stay home

        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          For me, a place like Paris permits me to be somewhat of a nomad in my 
          own language, just as Québec does. But even this is mediated by so much 
          speaking and reading and living in French. In Paris people just laugh 
          their heads off at my accent. At first they think I’m Québecoise and they 
          adopt this really sympathetic posture, then English comes out invariably 
          and they don’t know what to do.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          It’s a sympathetic reaction to the Québecois accent? Not patronizing?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Well, maybe patronizing but sympathetic. But it’s hard for them to be 
          sympathetic to an English accent, when English is the boss of the world. 
          So it puts them in a real weird situation and me too. But that Deleuzian 
          notion of deterritorialization is really at play in the way French affects 
          my English. Even the use of verbs—participles don’t work really in French, 
          but—the idea that English tends to be a far more descriptive language, 
          while French is more intervening. I think nobody has ever looked at this 
          in Stein and it would be interesting if they did: how the influence of 
          living in Paris made her focus so much on verbs in writing English. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Stein did talk about how being in Paris allowed her language to change 
          because it was in isolation.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          But that’s the interesting thing about the expatriates of that period: 
          that they did think of themselves as isolated. That’s impossible today, 
          for us. I don’t think we can live like that anymore.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Does that problematize the comparison between those expats in Paris and, 
          for example, English Canadians coming to live in Montréal?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          I think yes and no. Being Canadian or being in Canada gives us a very 
          conflicted and hypocritical relationship, historically speaking, towards 
          the French language. Most people who come here already have some background 
          in French; simultaneously, there is a malaise around language that signals 
          all is not right, which comes from a fundamental dichotomy in Canadian 
          history. Is there a guilt factor involved? Must one either feel guilty 
          or closed off? So, you see, it’s not quite the same thing.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          For English Canadians who come here, I think there’s a general feeling 
          that you’re not fully experiencing life in Montréal unless you’re integrated 
          somewhat into the French-speaking community. Although most of us fail 
          or succeed at that in varying degrees. But the “Lost Generation” in Paris, 
          a lot of them never learned any French—Stein for example—and took a certain 
          pride in that. There’s that quote from Stein that “foreigners should be 
          foreigners”—that there’s no point in being there if you’re going to go 
          native, so to speak.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Right. Also there’s a whole question of consciousness, awareness, that 
          marks books about other places from any epoch. I think in the 19th-century 
          travelogue, for example, the point was to go to the most exotic place 
          possible and to bring back as many exotic objects as possible. It implies 
          a kind of Imperialist self-other relationship that I think is muted today 
          by the fact that, first of all, we come from such mixed backgrounds ourselves, 
          most of us, but also because we live in a time when people are talking 
          about post-colonialism. You can’t ignore that when you’re writing a book 
          about travel. In the big cities of the world today the Imperialist chickens 
          are coming home to roost as it were. People of former colonies—whose countries 
          the West has destroyed by creating false boundaries so that they’re in 
          constant strife—have  totally transformed the face of Western cities.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Is there a sense in which the exotic, as a concept, has lost its meaning?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          I think when it pops up it’s extremely suspect. That doesn’t mean we’re 
          not all prey to it. In some ways we still have that desire. Part of her 
          big disappointment about being in Paris is the Paris she’s missing, that 
          she keeps talking about and just can’t find. On one hand, it’s the Paris 
          she read about in literature departments; on the other, it’s the very 
          contemporaneous one, with North African music and mint in the margins, 
          as she puts it.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          I’d like you to tell me why you were surprised about what I said about 
          feminism.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Well, because I think the postcolonial themes in the book are in some 
          sense inseparable from feminism. Also, I see the main project of the book, 
          and what I think it really accomplishes, as finding a way beyond the feminist/ 
          postmodernist problem. The idea that in postmodernism you have a decentered 
          subject, a fluid and inconstant identity, and yet feminist and postcolonial 
          movements rely on having a stable self, an identity to defend and promote.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          The strategies I’ve learned that I try to apply in my work are definitely 
          strategies learned from feminist attempts to express women in language. 
          But not all feminist writing is about having a stable self. Some of us 
          were trying to re-situate our selves as some other kind of subject less 
          bounded, after deconstruction, when the subject, the self, was considered 
          dead—which we all knew wasn’t true. Particularly feminists and visible 
          minorities knew this wasn’t true. But in this book, I think the subject 
          is more queer than feminist. She’s more uncertain about how she’s seen 
          in the world and how she is in the world. She distances herself from feminism, 
          both in the Sarajevo parade and when she sees the feminist on the sidewalk 
          fasting as a protest against rape in Sarajevo. She’s not really quite 
          there. And she walks around in this black suit which is very non-gendered 
          in a way—it’s not like a skirt and heels, it’s a Charlie Chaplin suit. 
          And I don’t think the clown is very gendered. Then when she does become 
          gendered, i.e. takes on a woman lover, in the last part, she kind of ceases 
          to be in the world. It’s like she’s split into two parts, she can’t do 
          both things at once, you know.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          I wasn’t thinking of feminism in the sense of identity politics. Both 
          the deconstructed self and post-colonialism have been obstacles to that 
          kind of feminism in the last couple of decades. I see the book as a new 
          possibility. I see it as attempting to write a way for feminism to survive 
          postmodernism.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          I agree. So often when people use the word feminist it seems to refer 
          to identity politics and I think that the writing I’m interested in right 
          now is as much concerned with the cusps, the threshold, the movement between 
          individuals, cultures, expressions and possibilities of gender. Having 
          said this, had not all the other stuff gone before I wouldn’t be able 
          to do what I’m doing now either. It’s a process that’s taken me from there 
          to here.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Maybe it’s the focus on the in-between that makes travel writing particularly 
          interesting right now, because it’s a way of escaping the self, and a 
          way of finding that balance that you seem to be trying to find in the 
          book, the balance between subject and object.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Exactly. That’s a really good way of putting it. </font></p>

          It occurred to me that <i>My Paris</i> also ties in to some of the things 
          written lately in which the book becomes a kind of architecture. Because 
          this is a guide to Paris, it becomes a sort of urban-planning novel. Do 
          you think of the novel as a way of mapping the city, or is the city just 
          the setting?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          I definitely think of it as a way of mapping the city. I did that in <i>Main 
          Brides</i> too, where I projected the characters onto a vertical grid 
          of the city, and I did a lot of research on the architecture and decoration 
          of the city. I don’t think it’s architecture per se that I’m interested 
          in, but I’m interested in making my work very very concrete and material. 
          That’s really important to me, and that comes out of a desire to relate 
          every-day life to the bigger structures around it. And in <i>Main Brides</i> 
          it was to project a place for women particularly onto that structure, 
          to map it as a space that was feminized in a way.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Because the city is basically a structure of male control.</font></p>

          But Montréal’s a very feminine city. It’s very unagressive for one thing. 
          It’s low, as major cities go. It’s decorated in a very florid way. It 
          has all this architectural stuff that’s completely dream-like. It’s also 
          a city—and Paris is like this too—in which private space and public space 
          come together more. You know, like in the East End people watching the 
          TV on the sidewalk in the summertime. The outside stairs. The way people 
          entertain out here as opposed to having people in. Paris is like that 
          too. And Paris is shaped like a snail as well, which is labyrinthine but 
          a very feminine kind of shape, I think. Also the manner in which Paris 
          is so concerned with all the details of life, it’s almost domestic in 
          a way. The incredible emphasis everywhere on food, clothes, getting your 
          nails done and your feet done. Which applies to both sexes. So in that 
          respect I think both Paris and Montréal have a thing that’s easy for me 
          to slip into.</font></p>

          There are so many places I’d like to go. The cities I’ve been to that

          It’s not really a free port anymore but it has that history. I’d love 
          to go to Shanghai. New Orleans is city I adore too. For some of the same 
          reasons. I like the cities that have a slightly illicit air about them, 
          where all is not ruled by the work ethic. My mother’s family made their 
          living running rum—well, part of my mother’s family—over the American-Canadian

          She said that Paris was the home of the 20th century, for various reasons, 
          but largely because of the French nonchalant relationship to technology, 
          the refusal to mix technology with lifestyle. Why don’t you tell me about 
          your own relationship to technology. How does it inform or impinge upon 
          your writing?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Ah. Well now we’re into something that’s very different I suppose between 
          generations. Hmm. Stein actually went even farther than that. At some 
          point she said or strongly implied that the Americans, in order to invent 
          the 20th century, had to go to a very 19th century place. In terms of 
          pace of life. Where you still could and still can go into a shop and choose 
          between ten different kinds of butter and a hundred different cheeses. 
          That kind of artisanal production which the French still insist on is 
          very different from the high-tech life that we as North Americans experience 
          in everything we do. My relationship to technology depends on what technology 
          I guess. I feel that I’ve learned an awful lot from, for example, surfing 
          the net or whatever. Because it gives me this feeling that I never had 
          before. We construct ourselves differently on the internet or using email 
          than any kind of self has ever been constructed. We break ourselves up

          It certainly has affected and continues to affect my work, but I don’t 
          think I relate to it the way someone of your generation would, or  someone

          it really is a... what’s the Deleuzian term, an extension of the body...</font></p>

          [It turns out I’m the same age as her daughter.] It’s true. Television 
          has shaped the way I see the world in many ways. Less so with the internet, 
          because it’s new, but maybe that’s what it will be for people who are 
          kids now.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Right. And I think that has really started to affect the way we see not 
          only who we are as humans but who we are as writing subjects. It’s interesting 
          that literary movements all through the 20th century have kind of foreseen 
          in their writing practice what’s happening now. I mean the notion of the 
          subject breaking down started really with the Surrealists, Artaud, etc. 
          And then deconstruction came along and everyone said, oh no! But now we 
          realize that we’re living in that world.</font></p>

          It’s almost as if the thoughts of writers and philosophers create the 
          pre-conditions for the next cultural shift. I mean, maybe we wouldn’t 
          have been able to even conceive of something like the internet if we hadn’t 
          gone through surrealism, deconstruction and all that.</font></p>

          One wonders. It’s hard to do the cause and effect thing, but it seems 
          there’s got to be some kind of dialectic relationship that goes on there. 
          But I think one’s relationship to technology depends not only on what 
          time period, but also what conditions you grow up in. Where did you grow 
          up?</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Yeah. And I grew up in a small town, near Cornwall [Ontario, near the 
          Québec border]. So we didn’t grow up in the 20th century in some ways. 
          I think many people in Canada didn’t, in that respect. While a lot of 
          other people did. Children of holocaust survivors, for example, certainly 
          had to grow up in the 20th century. So it really depends where you come 
          from.</font></p>

          Speaking of the country. Your writing has always been distanced from one 
          of the main characteristics of Canadian writing, according to Margaret 
          Atwood, Northrop Frye etc. I mean the connection to landscape or wilderness. 
          Your books, except for <i>Spare Parts</i>, are all urban in setting. Is 
          that a conscious choice for you?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          It probably was a conscious choice at some time. I find that I have difficulty 
          writing if I’m not living very intensely. For me, writing and living really 
          go together. In that way, even though I don’t belong to the “performance 
          generation,” writing has always been for me a kind of performance. I need 
          a place where I can perform. I need the place to perform back. I’ve tried 
          at various times to live in Edmonton for personal reasons, and I just 
          couldn’t write there, at least not for sustained periods. There’s too 
          much physical space, between people, basically. So I need to be in a big 
          city, really.</font></p>

          You’ve mentioned before that the kind of writing you’re doing features 
          something you call the New Narrative subject, which is mostly written 
          by queer writers. What is New Narrative?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Well, it’s just what I’ve been talking about all along. I think it involves 
          the abandonment of the beginning-middle-end kind of story in favour of 
          all kinds of montages and juxtapositions of different types of stories 
          in the same space. Many of the younger writers in Montréal are seemingly 
          almost spontaneously writing what falls into my idea of New Narrative. 
          In Robert Majzels’ <i>City of Forgetting</i>, there are some new narrative 
          qualities, such as using characters from other times—inserted, almost 
          pasted into or onto, a present-time narrative. But queer writers basically 
          began this movement, for the most part, maybe because it involves a displacement 
          of the writing subject in drag, plus a refusal to look away from questions 
          of social, political, or theoretical import. There’s an explicitness and 
          flaunting of the personal, which then of course ceases to become personal. 
          Flaunting implies with style. Above all I’d say it involves a concern 
          with texture and language which I don’t think a more teleological narrative 
          has, because there’s a goal you have to get to. In fact, it involves a 
          refusal of any goal. So the texture of the prose becomes extremely important 
          again, as it is in poetry, and as it was in some 18th-century writing. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          That sounds very anti-narrative. What’s the relationship to narrative? 
          Why call it “New Narrative” at all?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Well, it is narrative. I mean Stein said it. Narrative is any one thing 
          put after any other thing. For me narrative is what makes the really interesting 
          prose being done today different from the interesting poetry being done 
          today. Particularly the novel form is a choice you make because you want 
          to ask big questions. And that requires certain connections and a working 
          out of those connections. Not towards an answer, but towards really posing 
          the questions well. I don’t think poetry can take that on in the same 
          way—poetry does something else, that prose can’t take on. I say “New Narrative” 
          faute de quoi dire; I can’t think of a better word. The explicitness in 
          New Narrative about who’s writing, and about questioning that writing 
          position is important because novels today are more and more about situating 
          ourselves in history, and our relationship to history. And to the crimes 
          of indifference that we, and our states, and our culture, commit all the 
          time.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          You say that the role of the novel is to ask big questions, but on a grammatical 
          level anyway, you don’t ask any questions in <i>My Paris</i> because there 
          are no question marks.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Because it’s just one big question! Question marks become redundant. I 
          would have to put one after almost every sentence I suppose. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Good point. What about commas? Basically there are no commas in the text 
          except where they’re used for translation, to separate one language from 
          another. The comma of difference.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Right. That’s part of my discussion with Stein, who says in one of her 
          passages, I can see you all together, no matter how many there are of 
          you in a place, and I can write a portrait of you in about three words. 
          And for me there’s a relationship between that and abolishing commas which 
          is—and I think this is also a republican project—finding what is alike 
          in everybody. In a way, it’s the genius of republicanism. But what are 
          we afraid of in Québec, if that portrait happens? That difference will 
          disappear. So I play with the comma here as a sign for the cusp of translation, 
          and protecting difference from assimilation. As opposed to abolishing 
          it altogether.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          I was unsure whether the verbs in the novel were participles or gerunds. 
          I.e. verbs or nouns. I figure that because there are never any auxiliary 
          verbs used with them, they’re not true participles. They’re sort of in 
          between.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Yeah, they are kind of in between. They are an attempt at moving backwards 
          and forwards at the same time in the sentence. But by definition if you’re 
          moving backwards and forwards at the same time you’re staying in the same 
          place. When Carla Harryman read the book she said, Oh, this is a book 
          of ends of sentences. She saw it as part of the sentence being missing. 
          It’s typical of Carla to find a completely different and fresh way of 
          seeing it. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Gertrude Stein abolished the comma from this century. If you were to abolish 
          one punctuation mark from the next century, what would it be?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b>

        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          That’s a good idea. Why would you abolish them?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Well, for the obvious reason: we’re all quoting each other all the time 
          anyway, so why put anything in quotation marks? Also I hate long dialogue 
          in prose. The kind of dialogue I like in prose pops forward as a performance 
          in a text as opposed to representation of real-time speech. Which is how 
          so many people use dialogue.</font></p>

          I felt it wasn’t coincidental that <i>My Paris</i> was written at the 
          end of the 20th century. There’s a sense of summing up what has come before, 
          and of dreaming the future. How is writing going to evolve in the next

          Writing is really changing, the way it changed between the 18th and 19th 
          centuries, and I don’t understand why so few people see this. For all 
          the reasons we’ve talked about, and particularly the relationship of the 
          younger generations to technology, there is no way that the kind of novels 
          that are still sold by the dozen and advertised ad nauseum—I mean, nobody 
          is going to care about them. It astonishes me that this industry exists 
          that people make such a fuss about, when it’s over! I’m sure it’s over. 
          I can tell from my students that it’s over. Before they even talk to me. 
          It’s just the way they are in the world and they way they write about 
          the world.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          So you don’t think that in the next century there are going to be murder 
          mystery novels and so on?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Oh yeah. But they’ll be different than they are. I just think that the 
          book itself is changing, never mind the novel, the book is changing so 
          profoundly.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Do you have a sense in your writing that, like Stein, you are inventing 
          the next century?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          No, I don’t think I’m the right generation for that. I hope my work is 
          part of that movement, but I think the people who will invent the next 
          century, in the sense of trends and styles, were born in the 1970s and 
          1980s, people who are dealing with new technology, gender, race, in ways 
          that are so interesting. Actually, I have trouble speaking of history 
          in a linear way. I would say that the way some of us have always been 
          writing in the last quarter of the 20th century are elements in a field 
          just now starting to really blossom.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          You said before that you think postmodernism is dead. Do you think that 
          something else is being created to replace it, in terms of writing?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          Yes, I do. I think that’s a question you can almost answer better than 
          I can, you know. I think this little Montréal scene of writers we have, 
          our little enclave, is really interesting. Marta Cooper said to me once, 
          it’s so bizarre that the writers who are kind of our elders don’t have 
          any weight—I mean we’re not the Atwoods and Ondaatje’s. The good side 
          of that is that we learn an awful lot from each other all the time. It’s 
          not like a mentor-protégé situation. Or maybe because we’re a small community, 
          there’s an ongoing discussion that happens on some level.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          Well, I think it’s also that the Montréal writers I think of as mentors, 
          including yourself, are much closer to what I want to be doing than the 
          writers with mainstream clout.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>GS:</b> 
          But getting back to your question. There’s a way that younger writers 
          in this scene—people just starting to write—are using narrative, that 
          kind of absorbs what has gone before in a very different way than the 
          way somebody like myself uses narrative. But it’s important that it’s 
          absorbed. I mean it doesn’t “evacuate” the writing that has gone before, 
          but absorbs it in a different way and projects something else. I find 
          that really interesting. And while you’re doing that, learning maybe from 
          something I’ve done, I’m also learning from what you’re doing as a generation. 
          The generational differences are definitely there in all kinds of ways, 
          but I think it’s possible to learn from each other.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>CF:</b> 
          It’s hard for me to think of writing like yours, or for example Kathy 
          Acker, as something that has gone before. It’s actually what I’m immersed 
          in as a reader. It feels very connected to contemporary life, and that’s 
          why I feel much closer to it than more mainstream, representational writing. 
          Like we were saying, the writing seems to precede the culture or mentality. 
          The way I perceive the world today, having grown up with certain technologies, 
          is reflected in work that Kathy Acker was doing in the 70’s, or in your 
          work.</font></p>
