These &quot;pieces&quot; amuse, provoke and parody the conventions         of poetic line, narrative, script, setting and plot, and finally with         the notion of &quot;book.&quot; <i>Point and Line</i> begins with a piece         entitled &quot;Outline, In My Mind&quot; which works like a conceptual         table of contents whose parts take on a cumulative narrative, culminating         in an &quot;Index of Irrational Thoughts.&quot; In keeping with this parody         of &quot;book&quot; is the final &quot;Impotence of First Lines&quot;         which is equally amusing in its ability to cast &quot;lines&quot; as a         type of poem all its own, often reveling in puns and the impossible game         of arts distillation.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Field         has created a playground of provocative thoughts and human actions which         become performance on the page. As the epigraph suggests, the page is         sometimes seen as canvas, as an opportunity for intersection of prose         &quot;lines&quot; and lines of sight as well as for explorations of &quot;point&quot;         and &quot;significance.&quot; Like the &quot;points&quot; in a compass,         as in &quot;The Compass Room,&quot; spinning turns points into lines that         open out into infinite space. Set in geographically varying places &quot;The         Compass Room&quot; is ultimately a story of direction, of points in time         and space where relationships form and are changed. The &quot;compass&quot;         spins through domestic scenes, through &quot;Glass. Steel, Natural light,&quot;         &quot;winter pockets,&quot; &quot;the space between stairs&quot; &quot;door         knobs,&quot; &quot;closets&quot; and through sex, pregnancy and tumors.         &quot;Characters in tragedies are defined only by their actions, &quot;         Field quotes, reminding us, among other things, to question rules and         assumptions. How much is a matter of perspective? Of reading and interpreting         maps? &quot;On humid days the house sweats maps: red and blue until one         of us gets up to leave, when dishes whiz up the trees on toy train tracks.&quot;         Fields is an imaginative vision not trapped by rooms borders.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She         is working beyond the notions of purely &quot;literary&quot; forms, where         page is also the possible &quot;theater&quot; for the meeting of characters,         language and the subversion of expectations: &quot;A billboard comes down         piece by piece. You thought you heard me/say something? A wall, a line,         a galaxy, or the flesh of our heads/stands between us. Where you see a         barrier, there is a place of opportunity.&quot; (A:1). Field is continually         breaking barriers in this book, tearing them down &quot;piece by piece.&quot;         In the play entitled &quot;Hours,&quot; un-stage-able acts occur:</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The         coke machine is mercilessly raped.
