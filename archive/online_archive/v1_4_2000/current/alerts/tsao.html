She buckles you in with analytical detachment and you know         you are a captive reader for the duration. The theme resonating through         all her three collections is the reclamation of a personal and ethnic         history as an Asian-American mother of two daughters through the painful         absence of her own mother who died in a tragic automobile accident.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>The         Unbearable Heart</i> is a moving elegy in her mothers memory and this         thread continues to weave a tapestry of loss and absence through all three         collections. In her poem, The Unbearable Heart, the following lines         haunt me as I read her subsequent work: As I write this, I still demand         your attention, mother<i>. </i>Her mother becomes the driving force of         her verse in several ways. By becoming the poets muse, her mother will         always be present in her daughters and granddaughters stories. As the         impetus of Hahns poetic voice, she is the path to the aesthetics of a         daughters heart and the connection to Hahns own Japanese-American heritage         replete with its own domestic stories and cultural myths.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In         the poem, Cuttings, Hahn explores the her familys loss with the zuihitsu,         a form of Japanese essay which can be traced as far back as the Heian         period as a type of informal book of notes which men and women composed         when they retired to their rooms in the evening and which they kept near         their sleeping place, possibly in the drawers of their wooden pillows,         so that they might record stray impressions.<a href="#_edn1"name="_ednref1" title=""><span>[1]</span></a> The sensual imagery in this poem         is intense and an element that is evident in all of her work:</font></p>      <table width="507" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">        <tr>          <td width="25">&nbsp;</td>          <td width="482"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She             taught me to pluck or cut flowers near the roots for the long stems.<br>            </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Recut             under water.

The poem, The Glass         Bracelets is an outcry of indignation as Hahn reads a story in the newspaper         about a woman who was wedded to the deity Dev at the age of seven as         sexual slave to the men visiting the Temple: </font></p>      <table width="513" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">        <tr>          <td width="25">&nbsp;</td>          <td width="488">             <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At               onset of menstruation the child was,<br>              </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">and               still is, auctioned for the privilege of<br>              </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">tearing               her hymen often times<br>              </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">by               one with syphilis or gonorrhea<br>              </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">virgins               believed to be a certain cure.<br>              </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It               is difficult for me to like men at times,<br>              </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">any               man, when such atrocities are sanctioned<br>              </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">by               the religious.

Hahn quotes several lines from feminist         writers including Adrienne Rich and Elaine Showalter. Her study of feminist         writers has elicited a poetic response which had been dormant prior to         this collection. This voice of remonstration continues into her latest         collection, <i>Mosquito &amp; Ant</i>.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But         there is more to Hahn than her outrage over the exploitation of women.         Her poetry is a lyrical combination of alliteration, repetition and wordplay         charged with multiple meanings. Her collection, <i>Mosquito &amp; Ant</i>,         her richest work to date, exemplifies her talent with words and their         associations. The title poem, Mosquito &amp; Ant refers to the secret         language of Chinese women called Nu Shu (female writing) which could date         as far back as the Soong Dynasty (900-1279) as a form of resistance to         feudal Chinas repression of women with its barbaric practice of foot         binding and denying access to education. Little is known about these writings         as Chinese men customarily (and expediently) burned womens books when         they died. In the poem, she reclaims the lost text of these women when         she tells us, I want my letters to resemble/tiny ants scrawled across         this page.// I want my letters to imitate/mosquitoes as they loop/around         the earlobe with their noise:// I want my letters to resemble the smoke/when         the widower burned his young wifes poems/so she might polish them in         heaven./The smoke not unlike that from burnt toast or punk. The incense         of Hahns poetry is not to soothe, but to chafe with pungent words insuring         that the reader not forget the historical/cultural value of what has been         lost.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In         my favorite poem, Responding to Light, she renders a personal narrative         of the way women are silenced behind the walls and closed doors of American         homes today. The interaction is so subtle and so implicit that we almost         miss the implications of what could happen to mothers who disappear         into the woodwork and the impact this disappearance has on a crucial period         in a daughters development:</font></p>      <table width="513" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">        <tr>          <td width="30">&nbsp;</td>          <td width="483"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Somewhere             in the small house with no hallways<br>            </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the             mother disappeared<br>            </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">just             before the oldest daughters plump body<br>            </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">too             early sprouted hair<br>            </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">and             too early, though any time was too early,<br>            </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">budded             nipples.

Consequently, her loss is sublimated into the mother         (and poet) she would become by not making the same mistakes. Within this         open space of insight resides tremendous power to alter the course of         ones own destiny by rejecting patriarchal codes of conduct.
