Her rich attempts to reconcile         competing claims of abstraction and representation lead her into investigations         of the original and the copy. The collection begins playing with the genres         of letter and dictionaryDear_____, tricks out a defining impulse into         the space of seriality: </font></p>      <table width="507" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">        <tr>           <td width="26">&nbsp;</td>          <td width="461">             <p>Replication: n.

She makes good on the zestful serendipity of         template (mad-lib) and collage techniques, and her results are as slippery         and playful as a Rosmarie Waldrop paragraph. Repetition (in traditional         and nonce forms alike) in Sharmas work generates a misleading but potent         rhythm; we may not arrive where we thought we were going, but the march         carries us happily through. The book is as much a meditation of the inevitability         of imitation and duplication as a demonstration of delight in its small         variations. Sharma rhymes and chimes her way through as if each word were         a homophonic translation for the next. An ebullient cadence and devilish         diction, teetering on the verge of apprehension, pin-ball through <i>Bliss</i>.         Each word feels its way to the next with a fierce fidelity to the sound         and sense of language, and in doing so, poem after poem<i> </i>create         strange, searching linguistic landscapes. </font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ironically,         one of the words Sharma utters again and again is real: To feel that         children are innocently real; ...to fret a discourse to you, sunshine,         will not let me discover the gears // to real sensations; we stop /         the poem from the real dream that stood underneath her; ...the fastest         way to count your own real red chickens; first you have to become a         real person, so to speak. She creates an artificial space in which to         replicate the real, and so reveals its absurdities and amusements. The         urban jungle reproduces itself everywhere as does the selfall things         subject to definition in Sharmas work are subject to replication and         analogy. And definitions pattern her work, yet they ask to be read reciprocally         rather than cumulatively. The most beautiful analogy // of repeatable         space is the face, says a speaker in one poem. Of course, the symmetry         of the face displays a structural reflection, and a tendency to see in         terms of reflection, enacting Walter Benjamins idea that the gift we         possess for seeing similarity is nothing but a feeble vestige of the formerly         powerful compulsion to be similar and to behave mimetically. Poorly         matched the world and she / or so her best self would say. </font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The         first section of the book (which is divided into two chapbook-like sections)         is bracketed by Dear______ and Apology, both epistolary poems that         could be addressed to the reader or a lover. Her use of doubles recalls         Ashbery, especially in their stunt-person-like ability to argue with themself,         to mock and expose their own romantic notions and visionary aspirations.         Sharma insists, you dont know me anymore. This will be a re-occurring         theme. The prismatic selfa blank and simply symphonic you refracting         experience, transmuting representations of selfallows utter self-doubt         and confidence, vulnerability and invisibility to co-exist. Yet no flowery         dualism resides here. Multiple subjectivity bends toward relationships,         not a dynamic sense of self, and underscores one of the books obsessionsmisunderstandings,         lamentable and laudatory, implicit in all communication, but especially         between intimates. </font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The         mischievous delight taken in the slippage of daily communication here         serves to complicate relationships in the first section and focuses more         on cultures and lifestyles (rock star, poet, vendor, assassin, suburbanite)         in the second.  Urban human relations in <i>Bliss</i> percolate with cranky         spark and mistakes worth claiming. Sharma combines the elastic loopiness         of OHaras improvisational riffs on idiom and the creepiness of Berrymans         colloquial twists; she embraces the infelicities of American street talk         and the diction of translation guidebooks and cartoons: You are pointing         west when you say dish-desh; I am happy to be organized with my problems.         Disjunctive dialogues continually morph the terms of argument and short         circuit in frenetic and funny inflations. The book pulses with mania thats         checked by a straight-faced delivery, a real delivery, Sharma might say,         and a real joy.</font> </p>      <hr>      <p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">BIO</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">:         Christine Humes book <i>Musca Domestica</i> is the 1999 Barnard New Women         Poets Award winner.
