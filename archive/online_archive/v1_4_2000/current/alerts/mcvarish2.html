In the memory of         that gesture, I now find a sketch of the themes so elaborately staged         and effectively lit in Johanna Drucker's <i>Figuring the Word</i>. Among         them vie public and private language, materiality and meaning, writing         and self... In my childhood episode, a self-proclaimed will to authorship         guided my hand. In my reading of Drucker's magnificent collection of essays         and experiments, I found this will to be the life-force behind and within         a body of work, a host of ideas, of insights and formulations, so full         as to give real shape to what in another's conception would remain skeletal         abstractions.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To         those interested in histories and theories of the alphabet, visual poetry,         experimental typography, artists' books, materiality and information,         Johanna Drucker, artist and critic, academic and popular theoretician,         must sometimes seem omnipresent.  Such is her proliferation of books,         talks, exhibitions, even institutional programs. But what is perhaps more         astounding than this ubiquitous involvement in her field(s) is the way         in which she manages to be present in her own writing, especially given         the paradox that any such pretense of presence necessarily poses to her         sophisticated grasp of the mechanics of signification. And yet present         she isin every phrase of the pieces selected for this latest publication:         not just in the fascinating and topical interview with which the collection,         significantly, begins, nor  simply in subsequent first-person accounts         of her own lifelong experience with writing, books, and visual language,         but in the very theoretical constructions which ground her massive historical         perspectives, in her inimitable tendency to lend a concrete adjective,         an animate quality, to the furthest metaphysical implication. Indeed,         it is her unique combination of a capacity for summarywhich seems to         be infinitely elastic and always meaningful in its embrace of the longest         histories and most general truthsand a seemingly irrepressible desire         to give her subjects a face, a body, a character that makes Drucker's         prose such a thrill to ingest.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It         is a joy to partake of the confidence that drives her sweeping introductions:         &quot;In every era of human history,&quot; she writes at the start of         the &quot;The Art of the Written Image,&quot; &quot;artists, poets, professional         and amateur scribes have been sensitive to the visual properties of written         forms.&quot;  And one is not just grateful for, but gratified by, her         perfectly punctuated abbreviationslike that which, in just three paragraphs,         takes the reader of this same essay on a logic and lineage tour from Mallarme's         turn-of-the-century origin-piece of typographic innovation, Un Coup de         Des, through Futurist, Dada, and Cubist experiments, to the mid-century         elaborations of Concrete poets, and up to the threshold of present-day         visual poetics in electronic media. The pleasure of such soaring perception         is fully matched, moreover, by that of coming across the metaphoric gems         that Drucker so generously scatters on the grounds of her reflections.         These prizes are not always pretty, for she does not shy from the frankly         fleshy in her close-up evocations of, say, a letter's behavior, a type         line's influence, or a text's loud surplus of visual information lost         in a digital exchange.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Still,         these tropes never fail to seduce by their very proximity to the forces         they represent, their intimacy with the secret life of language. In an         analysis of one of her own books, Drucker writes, &quot;If the form is         content, does it have only one meaning? <i>Carminum figuratum</i>. One         body one text? What transcendence? None. In The Word Made Flesh there         is no possibility of obtaining an iconic reference from the format of         the piece, nor of following a line of signification out through the chain         of signifiers to some final logocentric 'being.' The text is grounded         in its own vocabulary of tongue and gristle, meat and flesh and bone -         raw, crude, wiggling, spasming in a nice neat letterpress order. Just         try and keep your form in some neat order of content!&quot; From &quot;being&quot;         to &quot;gristle&quot; in twelve short words, from a conventional understanding         (form = content) to a challenge whose imperative (&quot;Just try!&quot;),         even as it points a finger at the reader, indicates the locus of the speaker,         the author, Johanna.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In         giving a name (and even this is enriched by a mirror image, for Drucker         means Printer which Drucker has been), a personal history (the implicit         anchor for Theory at every turn), and a personality (translate: idiosyncratic         vocabulary) to the generation of these texts, Drucker lends her own figure         to the Word, a self to the authority she so clearly achieves. And it is         this particular authorityone which reveals the means to its powerthat         is the hallmark of Drucker's work. Whether she is tackling a history of         visual poetics, a theory of artists' books, or a first go at a much needed         discussion of what is at stake in the confrontation of language and &quot;information,&quot;         her authorial display of thought pulls the reader into its current. Her         motivationa vital needis felt, her experience shared, her inspiration         inspiring. Her work is utterly coherent: from example to theory, present         to history, creation to criticism. And the superimposition of these layers         of investigation, which is effected in <i>Figuring the Word </i>by the         reproduction of multiple visual pieces and the republication of fifteen         intensely active years' worth of articles covering centuries of the world's         production and decades of her own, results in a rich experience of many         related revelations. Not least of these is that there is no such thing         as writing without desire nor reading without pleasure.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It         would be impossible to maintain anything less than a manifesto of agreement         with this lesson, at least in the face of Drucker's own oeuvre. And if         her work is at every level exemplary of the tenets it posits, and if her         energy is contagious, it is just as well. For Drucker's work though authoritative         is never final. It does not so much conclude as inaugurate. Whole fields         of inquiry are located by her ever-active index, and we are invited, with         great generosity, to make use of her beginnings in our own further reading,         writing, making, and thinking. </font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>BIO</b>:         Emily McVarish is a book artist who lives and works in San Francisco.         She is an instructor of Design at the California College of Arts and Crafts         and, since 1990, has operated her presses, Axel &amp; Otto, in both commercial         and experimental ventures.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>&nbsp; </p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="index.html">alerts</a>         </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="../index.html">table         of contents</a> </font></p>      <hr>      <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../../../Images/navbar.swf">          <param name="quality" value="high">          <embed src="../../../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    </td>  </tr>    <tr>     <td width="86" height="1" valign="top"><img width="86" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="14" height="1" valign="top"><img width="14" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="1" height="1" valign="top"><img width="1" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="17" height="1" valign="top"><img width="17" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>  </tr></table></BODY></HTML>
