        <i>before lots of necessary work had been done</i>, a feeling I&#146;ve 
        had recently at conferences where it seems implicitly pass&eacute; to 
        address issues like gender (an &quot;oh, haven&#146;t we already been 
        there&quot; feeling).&quot; (my emphasis). </font></p>

        Frost:</b> &quot;...my anxieties. First about loosening the grip (stranglehold?) 
        of academese on my writing and thinking. What would happen if this kind 
        of dialogue were incorporated into my critical prose?&quot; </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(I quote 
        from, and refer the reader to, Linda&#146;s introduction and Elisabeth&#146;s 
        endnote to the first batch of papers from the seminar in the February 
        2000 issue of <i>How2</i>.) </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The most 
        inspiriting aspect of the two-part seminar held at Penn State last October, 
        was that anxieties like Linda&#146;s and Elisabeth&#146;s, which while 
        they were astute enough to discern as subtle undercurrents, and brave 
        enough to name, were dispelled by the very fact of our meeting to share 
        our individual &quot;difficult soundings,&quot; and by recognizing that 
        such sharing is itself an essential part of the work. It helps immeasurably 
        to see each other&#146;s faces, to hear each other&#146;s voices, to risk 
        our work-in-progress, to understand that one&#146;s work is always part 
        of a larger work-in-progress. And to remember, with Kathleen, that &quot;I 
        [we] have just begun to engage with the difficult soundings of modernism&#146;s 
        female half.&quot; And that I, we, poets, critics, teachers, <i>still 
        need</i> what the modern women writers have to offer, indeed <i>still 
        need</i> to consider who they were, what they accomplished, and how they 
        remain to be discovered. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Kathleen 
        so deftly uses that word &quot;sounding,&quot; as both the thing to be 
        heard and to be read (that sonorous, reverberant literary legacy) and 
        the process of delving into it, plumbing its depths &#151; critics by 
        &quot;line and lead&quot;? poets by appreciative &quot;echo,&quot; magnifying 
        and replying? That both of these are <i>difficult</i> soundings lends 
        to them gravity and dignity; both require intellectual rigor and the willingness 
        to trust one&#146;s own reactions, one&#146;s own sense of pleasure and 
        conviction. It is no wonder that Linda ends her essay, anxiety quelled, 
        with a vision of &quot;the ripple effect of reading communities, imagining 
        each woman returning to a classroom, a pen, a computer . . . to contribute 
        to ever-new narratives emerging.&quot; And Elizabeth writes of feeling 
        &quot;as Kathleen Fraser put it, &#145;familied&#146; among other women 
        poets and past and present, who are enmeshed in dialogue, who want to 
        connect, who are willing to experiment.&quot; And surely such vital experiments 
        in conference format and atmosphere are valuable contributions to an inaugural 
        meeting of scholars of modernism.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The papers 
        reproduced here add to Kathleen&#146;s list of what women poets and critics 
        still need from the modern women poets, and indicate how much necessary 
        work is still being done. Indeed they add to the list of who those women 
        poets were: Caroline Maun brings Evelyn Scott to the fore as an alternative 
        Imagist. Kimberly Lamm argues for the equal importance of the different 
        language and gender concerns of Zora Neale Hurston and Gertrude Stein 
        to the work of Harryette Mullen. Jenny Goodman argues for, and demonstrates, 
        an expansion of feminist critical interest beyond the concerns of contemporary 
        experimentalist writers with their declared allegiances to H.D. and Stein, 
        to writers whose overt political intention and presumption of female authority 
        allows a seizing of the epic tradition instead of shrinking from it, or 
        subversive undermining of it. She demonstrates this with readings of Muriel 
        Rukeyser and Sharon Doubiago&#146;s 20th century epic poems.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Edward Lintz 
        explores <i>antanaclasis</i> as a particular example of Stein&#146;s &quot;un-grammaring,&quot; 
        her radical use of repetition as &quot;offering other writers a new explanation 
        of how to compose.&quot; The papers of Nesrin Erysal, Cynthia Hogue, Heather 
        Thomas, and myself, clearly indicate that H.D.&#146;s empowerments and 
        permissions have not been exhausted. Nesrin shows H.D.&#146;s immense 
        affinities with the work of Jung, and her borrowings from &quot;heretical 
        discourses whose roots lie in ancient Gnostic teachings.&quot; Cynthia&#146;s 
        paper about &quot;Kathleen Fraser&#146;s Postmodernist Poetics,&quot; 
        also shows how an impassioned, avid reading of H.D. among women poets 
        and readers helped shape the innovations of the journal <i>HOW(ever)</i>, 
        <i>How2</i>&#146;s print predecessor. Heather&#146;s paper connects H.D. 
        and Anne Waldman in their epic ambition of writing &quot;salvation poetry&quot; 
        which delivers ever &quot;wider spiral[s] of healing.&quot; My paper concerns 
        the difficulties and rewards that Barbara Guest encountered in writing 
        H.D.&#146;s biography, and discusses the two poets&#146; convergences 
        and differences. (Lisa Joyce&#146;s paper about Susan Howe and the modernist 
        tradition does not appear here, but an excerpt can be found in the &quot;alerts&quot; 
        section of the February 2000 <i>How2</i>.) </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Lynn Keller, 
        the seminar leader, pointed out that many of the papers involve the persistent, 
        because unresolved issue, of how to construe the &quot;and&quot; between 
        modern and contemporary, how best to conceptualize relationships between 
        generations. This set of papers, adding to the considerations among the 
        first set of H.D. and Howe, Stein and Hejinian, Loy and Notley, Riding 
        and Retallack, H.D. and McGuckian, also adds to the richness and variety 
        of the ways &quot;and&quot; can be understood. &quot;And&#146;s&quot; 
        such as these, as Lynn pointed out, might serve to keep modernism from 
        becoming historically closed. They keep us alert to the complexities of 
        lineage: who to link with whom and how and why, and to the benefits and 
        limitations of reading two or more poets via lineage. What happens when 
        we add gender as one characteristic of lineage? I quote directly from 
        Lynn&#146;s notes: &quot;Are women more indebted to women predecessors 
        than to men? Or for different things? What are the implications of these 
        legacies? How can we keep talking about gender with awareness of complex 
        multi-positionality? Shouldn&#146;t &#145;and&#146; work retroactively 
        in time as well as in a chronologically linear manner? Can &#145;and&#146; 
        be as much about reading practices as it is about historical and stylistic 
        inheritance?&quot; Thus did Lynn connect our papers, (create an &quot;and&quot; 
        for them!) and indicate the many ways they demonstrated that &quot;and&quot; 
        cannot be taken for granted, but must become part of a vital critical 
        self-consciousness.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A last note: 
        one &quot;and&quot; that proved particularly exhilarating was the fact 
        that the seminar meeting became a dialogue between critics and poets. 
        The discussion was enlivened and enriched by the contributions of Rachel 
        Blau Duplessis, Kathleen Fraser, and Carla Harryman. </font></p>
