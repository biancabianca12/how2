        1991, Elizabeth Arnold, a graduate student at the University of Chicago, 
        discovered the typescript manuscript of Mina Loy's novel <i>Insel</i> 
        at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale, and was responsible 
        for its publication by Black Sparrow Press. The work had never been published 
        during her lifetime. In the chronology which accompanies the 1991 text

        with Joseph Cornell; begins revising prose works begun in Paris, including 
        <i>Insel</i>, presumably."(p.194). The work provides a unique view of 
        Surrealism from the perspective of a female experimentalist, who was both 
        attracted and repelled by a movement from which, as Susan Suleiman has 
        demonstrated, female participants were actively excluded. She writes:

        Loy who lived in Paris from 1923-36, was inevitably drawn to the hub of 
        innovative artistic activity. In particular, her role as agent for the 
        Julien Levy Gallery in New York, furnished the opportunity for contact

        It was Loy's experience at this time that formed the basis of her parodic 
        narrative in <i>Insel</i>, a work which engages with some of the central 
        tenets of Surrealism, even as it satirizes them, and provides a unique 
        critique of Surrealism from the perspective of a woman close to its centre. 
        It chronicles the struggle of a female narrator for artistic self-determination, 
        in the face of the appropriation of her psyche by a Surrealist artist, 
        who is able to induce in her, states of delusion and hallucination. This 
        strange encounter involves the narrator in a journey into the world of 
        the unconscious, which she describes as "a wilful descent into a forbidden 
        psychology."(p.99) Her words echo those of Andre Breton in the <i>First 
        Surrealist Manifesto</i> of 1924, where he writes of "<i>la promentade 
        perpetuelle en pleine zone interdite</i>." Breton's reference is to the 
        quest for access to the "forbidden zones" of dreams and the imagination, 
        where, liberated from the constraints of reason and reality, the creative 
        potential of the unconscious mind of the Surrealist might be harnessed 
        in the name of social revolution. </font></p>

        women were represented in Surrealist paintings and written texts, as the 
        inspiration and passive vehicles of men's self representation, complicated 
        the opportunities for women writers and artists as producers in their 
        own right. For the male Surrealist, woman was the medium through which 
        self-definition might be achieved. Andre Breton's <i>Nadja</i> (1928), 
        provides the paradigmatic example of this process, of which Rudolph E.Kuenzli 
        writes: </font></p>

            art and poetry are addressed to men; women are only the means to bring 
            about these works. Woman is seen by the male Surrealists only in terms 
            of what she can do for them. She is their muse … Nadja is illustrative: 
            Nadja's mental distress is used by Breton as a way to the unconscious. 
            She is a visionary; she can answer his questions, tell him who he 
            is.<sup><b><a href="#note6">6</a> <a name="back6"></a></b></sup></font></td>

        It is Nadja who become's Breton's guide into the realm of the unconscious. 
        It is here that he seeks the answer to the question "<i>Qui suis-je</i>?" 
        with which his narrative begins. Similarly, in <i>Insel</i>, Loy's female 
        narrator is the medium, albeit an unwilling one, who makes possible <i>Insel</i>'s 
        hallucinatory materializations. He affirms: "You tell me exactly what 
        I am thinking."(p.77) Like Nadja, she is instrumental in the process of 
        self-revelation for the male artist. However, while Nadja's clairvoyance, 
        her dependence on Breton and her mental instability ultimately destroy 
        her, Loy's narrator finally resists the role of participant in the shared 
        hallucinations to which she is initially compelled, and which drive her 
        to near insanity. She reverses the Surrealist paradigm, by parting from 
        <i>Insel</i> and moving towards self-definition in the writing of her 
        own text. Susan Suleiman has suggested that: </font></p>

            might provide a useful analytical category in approaching individual 
            [Surrealist] works. In mimicry, a woman 'repeats' the male - in this 
            case, the male Surrealist - version of "woman," but she does so in 
            a self - conscious way that points up the citational, often ironic 
            status of the repetition.<sup><b><a href="#note7">7</a> <a name="back7"></a></b></sup></font></td>

        <i>Insel</i> it is the female narrator, who asserts her artistry in the 
        very production of the satire in which the male Surrealist is imaged as 
        a dematerialising creature, at one moment an 'invisible will 'o the wisp', 
        at another an elusive deceiver, who weaves his own "history" out of dissimulation 
        and disguise. "You atrocious fake - you have no life to write - you're 
        <i>acting</i> Kafka!"(p.35) The text of <i>Insel</i> embodies the dialectic 
        between the struggling creativity of the female narrator and those protagonists 
        in the Surrealist endeavour, who depended on woman as "the means to bring 
        about" their own artistic and theoretical realisations. In this engagement 
        with Surrealism, as in her earlier encounters with Futurism and Dada, 
        Loy displays what has been referred to by Susan Suleiman as a 'double 
        allegiance', a concept Suleiman applies to postmodernist women writers, 
        "who were drawn both to the formal experimentation and cultural radicalism 
        of the historical male avant-gardes and to the later feminist critique

        as painted canvass and as written word, Loy invites the reader to share 
        her own visions of a surreal world. In her multi-layered writing there 
        is an imbrication of ideas concerning identity and insanity, sexuality 
        and gender, reality and surreality, which is redolent of the strangely 
        disturbing dream-logic of paintings by Rene Magritte or Richard Oelze,<sup><b><a href="#note9">9</a></b></sup>

        <i>Insel</i> will parody the mystical and occultist elements in Surrealist 
        thought, which sought to tap the mysterious forces of the unconscious 
        mind, is signalled early on, when, referring to Surrealism as "something 
        fundamentally black-magicky," (p.21) the narrator describes how the mere 
        presence of a Surrealist in the same room transformed her perceptions, 
        reducing her to a state of delirium. In a letter to a friend she draws

        Loy's parody, the multiplicity of oddly juxtaposed ideas which combine 
        in these opening words, establish some of the central concerns of the 
        work. Firstly, a connection is established between mental instability 
        and surrealism through the description of the protagonist as both a "more 
        or less surrealist painter", and a putative "madman." This reference to 
        insanity is the first of many which litter Loy's text. For example, in 
        a trance-like state of delusion the narrator will ponder: "If this is 
        madness…madness is something very beautiful," and later reacting to <i>Insel</i>'s 
        paranoid declaration, having taken up residence in her apartment, that 
        " 'I am a prisoner here' ", she responds, "It did not recur to me that 
        his classic complaint is an echo in the corridors of asylums." (p.111) 
        The narrative weaves a path between the external world of Paris streets 
        and cafes, and the interiority of the "forbidden zone" of the unconscious 
        mind. Events take place in a dangerous and paradoxical psychic borderland 
        between sanity and insanity, beauty and horror, a region to which the 
        narrator refers as "the unexplored frontiers of consciousness." (p.117)

        chaotic irrationalism, which is induced in Loy's narrator by <i>Insel</i>'s

        which woman was naturally vulnerable, like the infantile, primitive or

            duality of female nature, and his presentation of Laurencin as muse 
            and eternal child. But the Surrealist woman was also born out of Freud's 
            ambivalent and dualistic positioning of woman at the center of creative 
            and subversive powers of the love instinct, in her incompatible roles

        This is one of several metaphorical allusions to lichen or algae by which 
        Loy describes the intertwining of the narrator's psyche with the visions 
        of the Surrealist. These images may have been suggested by those paintings 
        of Max Ernst, in which the use of <i>frottage</i> has resulted in the 
        replication on canvas of what appears to be a tangled jungle of fronds 
        and foliage. See for example <i>'Forest and Dove'</i> (1927), in which 
        a line drawing of a caged bird, a well-used metaphor for female entrapment, 
        is superimposed onto background consisting of just such a dense forestation 
        of 'lichen'. <a href="#back17">[back to text]</a></font></p>

        Loy had, early on, published a poem in the women's issue of Others, Vol.III 
        No.3., September 1916, p.64, under the thinly veiled pseudonym 'Muna Lee'. 
        She also employed various names in autobiographical works, including 'Ova', 
        in <i>Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose</i>, 'Goy Israels', in the unpublished 
        text of that name, and 'Nima Lyo alias/Anim Yol alias/Imna Oly/(secret 
        agent buffoon to the Woman's Cause)', in the poem 'Lion's Jaws', ca.1919,

        See, for example, the various images of female mutilation in the Magritte 
        collages entitled, <i>Une Semaine de Bonte</i>, 1934, and Salvador Dali's 
        <i>Gadget and Hand</i>, 1927, in which a red hand mounted on a plinth, 
        (probably that of the guilty masturbator) is surrounded by the components 
        of the artist's erotic fantasies, including the dismembered torso of a 
        woman, and a classical nude statue. <a href="#back22">[back to text]</a></font></p>
