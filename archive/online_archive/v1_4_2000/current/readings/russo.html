<p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the work of Joanne Kyger the fact of presence plays out not in subjective 
        seeing and saying – not as reportage, or confession – but as <i>being</i> 
        and saying. The self is phenomenal and therefore as likely to <i>be</i> 
        seen as to see; seeing the self is not an act of introspection only, but 
        of an arraying. The self is <i>among</i>, always in relation, and in Joanne 
        Kyger’s case, in a “broad / sweeping form” of relations – in “being there.” 
        For over 40 years she has, in various and particular ways, engaged with 
        her circumstances, a fact to which the essays collected in this feature 
        attest. The results of her way of being and saying, though constantly 
        brought into print with one or another of the small presses in the tradition 
        of the New American Poetry, have escaped the critical eye – and in that 
        Joanne Kyger is at once very similar to women writers of her generation, 
        and very different from them.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        form “of being there” that readers of the now-called “Beat Generation” 
        encounter differs vastly from what it <i>was</i> to be there. And “being 
        there” – as a body in those spaces and amongst those signature productions 
        textual, social and psychological – once one <i>is</i> there, is easy; 
        but being able to say “what [one] wanted to say,” and being <i>heard</i>, 
        is another thing altogether.  Joanne Kyger, unlike many women of her generation 
        who wrote, had the rare – gift? opportunity? wherewithall? – to have been 
        “taken up” by male writers who ‘made’ the places where poetry was made; 
        literally, Joe Dunn and John Wieners, she will tell you, both young poets 
        themselves, took her to the Sunday Meetings where Robert Duncan and Jack 
        Spicer reigned. At a time when there were few poetry magazines (two in 
        fact) and only one small press edited by a woman, being invited into this 
        close-knit circle put her “under” the critical eye of those who brought 
        poetry into print – and in this particular fact lies her difference. Because 
        she has a large body of work published (over 20 titles) since 1965, we 
        might see her as a prolific and substantial poet of her generation. And 
        because her way of being was broad and sweeping, extending across several 
        continents, into geographies and local histories, and through friendships 
        with many poets and their differently inflected aesthetics, there is no 
        one way to talk about her work except as that of a singular individual.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Levertov’s 
        statement, in taking up sight as a metaphor for poetic knowledge, points 
        uncannily back to the context from which I plucked it: the Poetics section 
        of Donald Allen’s <i>The</i> <i>New American Poetry</i>. The editor as 
        seer, his vision enhanced by various informants, communicates what he 
        sees through forming various ‘memberships’: the five “somewhat arbitrary” 
        categories (Black Mountain/<i>Origin</i>, San Francisco Renaissance, Beat, 
        New York School, and a group of “younger poets . . . influenced . . . 
        but hav[ing] evolved their own original styles and new conceptions of 
        poetry”(xiii)) that provide “some sense of the history of the period and 
        the primary alignment of the writers.” By this he means their allied-ment, 
        i.e. to each other, affiliations of locale and aesthetic sympathy made 
        perceptible through poetry readings, little magazines, and the small press 
        – mechanisms that the “New American Poets” used to make public their distinguishing 
        characteristics. Allen’s anthology encourages us to see affiliations between 
        poets; and though ‘New American’ aesthetics may tend to be oriented toward 
        process rather than product, the affiliation, because this is an anthology 
        and not a time machine, plays in a variety of finished texts that render 
        poetically ‘the new.’</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sight 
        is also the primary indicator of sexual difference, a difference which, 
        if you are a woman writing poetry in the fifties and sixties – between 
        the War and the feminist ‘revolution’ – makes appearing as among or within 
        the writers of her generation an accomplishment. Levertov’s sentence, 
        fraught with sexist semantics, points to the heart of this problem when 
        the “seer,” the potentially ungendered constituent “members of one another,” 
        surfaces as pronominally male. A convention of English usage or a mechanism 
        of exclusion? We get a sense, however, that this distortion manifests 
        itself visually in the non-appearance of women in the category “seer,” 
        and that this is the telos of a compulsion to disregard women when considering 
        who composes ‘the new.’ Levertov, one of four women included in <i>The</i> 
        <i>New American Poetry</i> (Helen Adam, Madeline Gleason, and Barbara 
        Guest being the other three), is the only of that group to espouse a “poetics.” 
        Cast into increasingly myopic focus by an instrument tuned to see masculine 
        production where poetic production is sought, one sees four women, then 
        one woman, then only the seer “he” and no women at all. That same instrument 
        is what we refer to as “representation”; it is how we chiefly come to 
        terms with literary history. If anthologies are preservatives of “texts 
        that might otherwise disappear”(Golding 120) then what is <i>missing</i> 
        from an anthology <i>has</i> disappeared, for all practical purposes, 
        to contemporary and contemporaneous readers of poetry alike. Out of the 
        44 poets included in <i>The New American Poetry</i> these four are not 
        representative. The ratio isn’t accurate.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">That 
        a few women writers were born into a generation that certain male writers 
        made – and certainly made <i>new</i>, i.e. whose “total rejection of all 
        those qualities typical of academic verse”(xi) prevailed as their defining 
        characteristic – is one way to hear what <i>The New American Poetry</i> 
        tells us. But, as well, it sets the precedent by which we are now given 
        to read poetry in the ‘New American’ vein. Because it has taught poetry-readers 
        for decades to recognize ‘the new’ and because what it presents has been 
        taken for ‘the new,’ as we understand it ‘the new’ wasn’t produced by 
        women. What is the mote in the mechanism of representation, beyond the 
        obvious problematic of sexism, that yields up an overwhelming patrilineage? 
        The nomenclature and genealogies that <i>The New American Poetry</i> created 
        and preserves and through which we see poetic production and assign significance 
        shows itself to be a problem for locating, and so talking about, women 
        writers of that generation.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One 
        response to this distorting patrilineage has been to recover the work 
        of “Beat Generation” women writers in recent anthologies like Brenda Knight’s 
        <i>Women of the Beat Generation: The Writers, Artists and Muses at the 
        Heart of Revolution </i>and Richard Peabody’s  <i>A Different Beat: Writings 
        by Women of the Beat Generation</i>. But these produce another sort of 
        distortion: women who were not ‘there’ in the sense that Joanne Kyger’s 
        lines (and life) allude to become in these anthologies “women of the Beat 
        generation.” A troubling patronym, “women of,” it appropriates women into 
        the project of Beat history-making. As in “Daughters of the Revolution,” 
        which is, after all, another way of saying “property of,” as a sort of 
        appendage, a “Mrs.” Such a reading consequently accords with a particular 
        conception of women as marginal, looking from the ‘outside’ in and thus 
        appropriating materials and techniques – and hence the (Beat) idenity 
        – to be found there. In the case of the 1950s and 60s, women poets emerge 
        either as diminuitives of men, or, at best as merely (proto) feminists 
        – disarticulated feminists without a movement – without <i>movement</i>, 
        static and marginally affixed. To this end Knight and Peabody seemingly 
        compete to inaugurate the most obscure. (1) But it’s misguided at best 
        to label these women “marginal.” As Alan Golding has noted “The center/margin 
        or inside/outside model . . . reaches its limits when confronted with 
        historical specifics that contradict it”(142). History is full of specifics.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        don’t want, here, to develop a critical investigation of this problem 
        of literary-historical viewing, the problem of the anthology-frame. I 
        would like, instead, to suggest two things as a sort of conclusion:</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">First, 
        that there is another way to see women writers, <i>especially</i> of the 
        ‘New American’ generation, with its particular gender politics, a status 
        quo that remained unchallenged by the avant-garde. But this would, I believe, 
        require a bitter admission; that the women “of the Beat generation” were 
        writers generated out of refusals and failed acknowledgements of women 
        <i>as</i> writers, a result, in part, of a myopic tendency toward a specific 
        manifestation of the poetic, a specific concept of genius. That done, 
        one could view the production of women and women writers “of” that generation 
        as gestures outward. Not directed back toward the literary circles that 
        constituted the Beat movement – and through which various male constituents 
        cohered – but outward away from the identities “Beat” offered them, and, 
        in a proto-feminist self-naming, toward some yet unnamable horizon, a 
        direction offered neither by the status quo nor the literary avant-garde.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
        second, that though Joanne Kyger has consistently and for various reasons 
        been an exception to these gendered rules of exclusion, reading her work 
        in this context confirms the limited scope of the recuperative model, 
        for she has continually developed a poetry intricately involved with – 
        responding to and setting forth – the ‘new.’ In stressing the self as 
        a phenomenon, as appearing, being there – Joanne Kyger’s work encourages 
        one to move beyond the tendency to see two types of poets (women and men), 
        which in feminist scholarship has produced a particular, unfavorable model 
        of literary productions. Her work encourages one to see women writers 
        as gesturing outward – in the same generous sense that Charles Olson saw 
        Robert Creeley as a “figure of outward.” The current feature on the work 
        of Joanne Kyger in <i><a href="http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket11/index.html">Jacket 
        #11</a></i> ventures in that direction with an array of interviews, commentary, 
        and critical readings, none of them particularly attuned to gender but 
        all of them responsive to the powerful insistence of her cultivated line 
        and ear, and the graceful persistence of a continually evolving poetic, 
        one that lets the self go through listening to what’s there – from the 
        intimate notebook page and the company it keeps to larger temporalities 
        and geographies – to create a self, broad and sweeping.</font></font></p>
