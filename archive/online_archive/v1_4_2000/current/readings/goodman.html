      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Feminist 
        conversations about women's experimental poetry have increasingly focused 
        on the long poem, and especially on the large number of expansive poems 
        by women that have emerged since 1960. Lynn Keller's <i>Forms of Expansion: 
        Recent Long Poems by Women</i> (1997), for example, offers us the first 
        book-length study of U.S. women's contributions to the genre of the long 
        poem. In addition, several sessions at the 1997 MLA Convention led to 
        a special issue of the journal <i>Women Studies</i> (27.5, 1998), edited 
        by Kathleen Crown, also devoted to contemporary long poems by U.S. women. 
        As scholarship on women's verse in extended forms continues to develop, 
        the time seems right for an evaluation of how our constructions of the 
        legacy of modernist<i> </i>women's long poems shape our evaluations of 
        more recent long poems by women.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I have been 
        struck by the conspicuous absence of Muriel Rukeyser's expansive verse 
        from most discussions of women's long poems, even as feminist poets and 
        critics have intensified our investigations into modernist precursors 
        for contemporary women's work. Rukeyser's ambitious poetic sequences date 
        from the title poem of her first book, <i>Theory of Flight</i> (1935), 
        which won the Yale Younger Poets Prize, to the title poem of her last 
        book, <i>The Gates</i> (1976). Yet, despite a recent revival of interest 
        in her early sequences among scholars of 1930s culture, feminists concerned 
        with the modernist long poem have not provided her with nearly the amount 
        of attention that they have given to other writers, for example, H.D. 
        and Gertrude Stein. I believe that this relative lack of visibility of 
        Rukeyser's work is related to a continuing emphasis on the aesthetics 
        of female first-generation modernists associated with the American expatriate 
        community in Europe, who have been claimed as precursors by contemporary 
        female avant-gardists. The resulting conception of the female modernist 
        long poem&#150;and particularly of its negative relationship to the epic&#150;makes 
        it difficult to appreciate sequences such as Rukeyser's "The Book of the 
        Dead" (1938). Yet Rukeyser's major poem should interest feminist experimentalists, 
        as it draws upon a fascinating combination of modernist and documentary 
        techniques to profoundly reshape the male modernist epic.<a href="#note1"><b><kbd>1</kbd></b></a> 
        <a name="back1"></a> </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In this 
        essay, I want to investigate assumptions informing current notions of 
        feminist experimental poetry that limit our understanding of modernist 
        women's accomplishments in extended poetic forms. Further, I want to suggest 
        that "The Book of the Dead" exemplifies an alternative legacy of female 
        experimentalism, which also includes Gwendolyn Brooks's <i>Annie Allen</i> 
        (1949). In these and other major poems, female second-generation modernists 
        authorize their own entrance into the masculine tradition of the epic, 
        reworking epic conventions to address topical political issues of their 
        historical moment.<a href="#note2"><b><kbd>2 </kbd></b></a><a name="back2"></a> 
        If we determine the innovativeness of women's modernist poetry according 
        to fixed criteria derived from the particular social and aesthetic context 
        of the female expatriates, then we will continue to overlook the more 
        overtly political experimentalisms of modernist women poets of the next 
        generation, who wrote in quite different contexts. By identifying Rukeyser's 
        different strand of female modernists' expansive verse, however, we can 
        gain a powerful new perspective from which to read contemporary poets 
        such as Sharon Doubiago, whose book-length <i>Hard Country</i> (1982) 
        has just been republished after remaining out of print for about fifteen 
        years.<a href="#note3"><b><kbd>3</kbd></b></a> <a name="back3"></a></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A roundtable 
        conversation at the 1997 MLA convention (later transcribed in <i>Women's 
        Studies</i> under the title "The Contemporary Long Poem: Feminist Intersections 
        and Experiments") highlights some of the presuppositions among women poets 
        and scholars associated with "postmodernist" aesthetics that might lead 
        us to overlook or reject the writing of Rukeyser and its legacy for Doubiago 
        and other poets of the 1960s generation. When asked about the relationship 
        of their own long poems to the traditionally masculine genre of the epic, 
        several female authors of long poems immediately sought to distance their 
        own projects from the epic. For example, Kathleen Fraser spoke of her 
        need to enter the form of the long poem indirectly because of the repressive 
        force of the epic tradition behind it:</font></p>

            <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
              think this need to 'sneak' into it is fairly important for most 
              of the women writers or poets that I know. There is somehow the 
              weight of the epic&#133;the weight of what seems like a formal and 
              set history that we come into that actually is not set. But that's 
              how it's presented, especially if you have a strong Biblical background, 
              or an American or English literature background, if you are like 
              I was and felt the love of the lyric and certain Biblical passages 
              as a child, before school taught me what was appropriate and large 
              and important. I certainly backed off from that epic tradition. 
              I remember my husband often asking me, when he first met me and 
              knew my poetry, why I didn't write the epic? I could think of <u>nothing</u><i> 
              </i>that I wanted to do less. The epic represented this huge burden 
              of what already existed that I wasn't interested in trying to take 
              on or in any way enter. I backed into the long poem. I backed into 
              history&#133;. (516)</font></p>

      </dir>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This vehement 
        rejection of direct engagement with the epic was by no means exclusive 
        to Fraser. Indeed, I think that the manner in which Fraser distances herself 
        from the historical, religious, and literary traditions associated with 
        the epic is common to feminist avant-gardists, who tend to embrace resistance 
        and subversiveness over more accessible strategies for engaging in public 
        discourse. This stance is often accompanied by a suspicion of traditional 
        genres as inevitably caught up in "binary conceptual models that privilege 
        the masculine as rational and universal and have defined the feminine 
        as its complementary or negative pole" (Felski 42).</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This brand 
        of feminist aesthetics and politics can be closely linked to the female 
        modernist legacy that poets such as Fraser have helped to construct. When 
        asked about her awareness of prior expansive poems by women as she began 
        her own forays into longer work, Fraser mentioned H.D., Gertrude Stein, 
        and Virginia Woolf as key modernist sources for her early long poems. 
        These same figures appear in Fraser's account of the creation of <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        as representatives of a female modernist tradition that Fraser and her 
        collaborators in that journal sought to restore to visibility during the 
        1980s ("Tradition" 61). Another prominent experimentalist poet participating 
        in the 1997 MLA conversation, Susan Howe, mentioned H.D. and Woolf, along 
        with Emily Dickinson, as key precursors with ambitions analogous to those 
        of the epic (522). But Howe echoed Fraser's profound alienation from the 
        epic tradition: </font></p>

              think one has to acknowledge, as a woman, the extraordinary power 
              and beauty of some epic imaginations.&#133; As a woman writer placing 
              myself in a history of writing which I love (one that includes Spenser 
              and Milton&#133;) there is a great deal of anxiety because of course 
              so few women are there. Where did they go? The absence has become 
              infinitely mysterious to me. I think I am made up of it. I'm in 
              it. How do I get out, and what does that mean anyway? (522)</font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Fraser's 
        and Howe's descriptions of a woman poet's relationship to the epic as 
        "backing into" history or embodying "absence" are important articulations 
        of women's experiences of exclusion from a deeply male-centered literary 
        tradition. However, we need to be careful that these descriptions do not 
        become<i> </i><u>prescriptions</u><i> </i>for our consideration of women's 
        long poems. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Before examining 
        the challenge that "The Book of the Dead" poses to such discouraging assessments 
        of the epic's possibilities for women poets, I would like to clarify my 
        sense of the theoretical positions informing Fraser's and Howe's comments. 
        In "The Tradition of Marginality," first presented as a talk in 1985, 
        Fraser discusses her alienation from the dominant strain of feminist poetry 
        that emerged in the 1970s, which she describes as "often lesbian and separatist 
        in ideology and almost exclusively focused on poems of content that described 
        and reinforced the values and life-styles shared by this community" (59). 
        Feeling constricted by the notion of "the poem as a place for self-expression, 
        for giving a true account," Fraser located a very different aesthetic 
        approach in the writing of female modernists like Stein and Woolf, in 
        whose formal innovations she found "a structural order of fragmentation 
        and resistance to the patriarchal models" that she sought to embrace in 
        her own writing (58-59). </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Fraser's 
        statements from both the 1980s and 1990s suggest a general theoretical 
        orientation associated with French feminism (indeed she cites Luce Irigaray 
        in her 1985 piece). Rita Felski helpfully summarizes the relationship 
        between literary form and feminist politics in this perspective:</font></p>

              is not the text which reflects female experience that best serves 
              feminist interests, but rather the work which disrupts the very 
              structures of symbolic discourse through which patriarchal culture 
              is constituted. The artistically radical (experimental and innovative) 
              text is also perceived to be politically radical, in that it seeks 
              to challenge the most fundamental assumptions of a patriarchal society 
              as embedded in its codes of representation and structures of discourse.

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe also 
        embraces this general position. (She, too, cites Irigaray in her 1990 
        <i>Talisman</i> interview, along with Alice Jardine's <i>Gynesis</i>, 
        a text indebted to French theory.) Her interest in the question of how 
        the feminine is inscribed in discourse is shown in her focus on the marginal 
        and mute voices of the past and the ways in which deviations from standard 
        rational communication might call attention to the erasures involved in 
        apparently coherent histories.</font><font size="3"><b><kbd><a href="#note4">4</a></kbd></b></font><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In <i>My 
        Emily Dickinson</i> (1985), Howe makes clear that attention to silencings 
        and absences is a feminist project. She applauds the "skillful and ironic 
        investigation of patriarchal authority over literary history" that she 
        finds in Dickinson and Stein, locating these favored writers' subversiveness 
        at the linguistic level: "Who polices questions of grammar, parts of speech, 
        connection, and connotation? Whose order is shut inside the structure 
        of a sentence?" (11). There is a danger, however, in emphasizing exclusively 
        qualities of women's "experimental" texts&#150;such as ambiguous meanings 
        and the refusal of conventional grammar and syntax&#150;which theoretically 
        disrupt, in French feminist terms, "phallocentric" discourse. Consider, 
        for instance, Howe's proposal that the resistance to definitive interpretation 
        in Dickinson's poetry might suggest that Dickinson willingly chose to 
        inhabit a location outside of "power," "gender," and "voice": </font></p>

              one of Dickinson's abilities is to escape everything. If you think 
              you can explain a poem, she quickly shows you there is a way out 
              of that interpretation.&#133; I think she may have chosen to enter 
              the space of silence, a space where power is no longer an issue, 
              gender is no longer an issue, voice is no longer an issue, where 
              the idea of a printed book appears as a trap. ("<i>Talisman</i>"

        to what degree this vision of "escape" differs from women's traditionally 
        marginal role in print and in public life. Howe's apparent affirmation 
        of silence, genderlessness, and powerlessness reminds me of French feminism's 
        problematic resistance to rational discourse, the dangers of which Felski 
        cogently identifies: </font></p>

              is phallocentric, therefore processes of communication are always 
              and necessarily phallocentric. Whether it is men or women who speak 
              and whatever the context and content of their language, in speaking 
              discursively they are doomed to speak the masculine. This view thereby 
              serves to reinscribe women in a position of speechlessness outside 
              language, theory, and the symbolic order, denying any potential

        prolific literary and intellectual contributions of the 1930s and early

        in women's poetry before 1960.<a href="#note6"><b><kbd>6</kbd></b></a> 
        <a name="back6"></a>In "The Book of the Dead" (1938), Rukeyser neither 
        "backs into" history nor shrinks at the virtual invisibility of female 
        authors in the Western epic canon, from the classical heroic poems to 
        the radical revisions of the genre by Walt Whitman and modernists like 
        Ezra Pound. Rather, in the poem itself, she embarks on a "long road of

        the historically masculine discourses of politics, technology, mythology,

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Published 
        in Rukeyser's second collection of poetry, <i>U.S. 1 </i>(1938), "The 
        Book of the Dead" is based on the twenty-two-year-old Rukeyser's visit 
        to the site of a much-publicized silicosis tragedy at Gauley Bridge, West 
        Virginia and the transcript of a Congressional subcommittee's hearings 
        on the events. Early in 1936, with photographer Nancy Naumburg, Rukeyser 
        drove down highway U.S. 1 to research the circumstances of the dead and 
        dying men who had taken work, in the heart of the Depression, building 
        a tunnel for a hydroelectric dam and silica mining project. The majority 
        of the men were African American migrant laborers, who breathed silica 
        dust in the tunnel and lived in appalling work camps while the responsible 
        companies chose higher profits over known safety precautions. "The Book 
        of the Dead" begins, "These are roads to take when you think of your country," 
        launching a poetic investigation into hidden America with not only a documentary 
        but also an epic purpose. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A glance 
        at Rukeyser's poem, which spans more than sixty pages, reveals long passages 
        of Congressional testimony; references to chest X-rays, lawsuits, mining 
        safety equipment, and meager "relief" checks for disabled workers; and, 
        finally, a stock quote for Union Carbide, as if it has been cut out from 
        the business pages and pasted into the text. The poem obviously draws 
        upon the various techniques of reportage developed both in forums of the 
        radical Left and in government-sponsored cultural programs of the WPA. 
        However, the modernist collage epic is an equally important source for 
        Rukeyser's aesthetic strategies. In fact, in his review of <i>U.S. 1</i>, 
        William Carlos Williams commented that Rukeyser used documents in "The 
        Book of the Dead" "with something of the skill employed by Pound in the 
        material of his 'Cantos'" (141).<a href="#note8"><kbd>8</kbd></a> <a name="back8"></a>Rukeyser's 
        central cited source from outside of the leftist documentary tradition 
        is the Egyptian Book of the Dead, passages of which she incorporates in 
        her radical reshaping of Eliot's use of the Osiris-Isis myth in <i>The 
        Waste Land</i>. Also evoking <i>The Waste Land</i> and other early attempts 
        at the twentieth-century epic&#150;the early Cantos and Hart Crane's<i> 
        The Bridge</i>&#150;are cinematic movement, the incorporation of multiple

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To authorize 
        women as epic storytellers and agents in history, Rukeyser first builds 
        upon visible female roles in mid-1930s culture that grant women a degree 
        of authority: the social worker, the struggling mother, and the lyric 
        poet. She represents each of these subject positions through a historically-based 
        female character but chooses literary strategies that defamiliarize these 
        characters so as to enlarge the roles for women available in the discourses 
        of New Deal liberalism, Popular Front Marxism, and mainstream literary 
        criticism. As a second legitimating strategy, Rukeyser grants women a 
        visionary power that transcends the limits of available socially-produced 
        positions for women, drawing upon the Egyptian Book of the Dead to compose 
        a female-centered version of the well-known fertility myths that structure 
        <i>The Waste Land</i>. Finally, she links her attempt to re-envision American 
        identity to a more personal process of resisting her inherited position 
        as a privileged woman, a position which renders her complicit in the suffering 
        of her fellow citizens.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My brief 
        commentary on Rukeyser's complex poem can provide only a sketch of Rukeyser's 
        engagements with the modernist epic; readers can test my analysis through 
        a much closer look at the poem. However, my key point is that, far from 
        merely reproducing an exclusionary and repressive patriarchal epic tradition, 
        Rukeyser ultimately reworks the masculine conventions of the modernist 
        epic to compose a narrative of cultural redemption in which women become 
        shapers of myth and history.<a href="#note9"><b><kbd>9</kbd></b></a> <a name="back9"></a>Rukeyser's 
        particular revisions of the epic, and especially her examination of her 
        own simultaneous marginality (in terms of gender) and privilege (in terms 
        of social class), show affinities with Sharon Doubiago's <i>Hard Country</i>, 
        published almost fifty years later. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A book of 
        more than 250 pages, <i>Hard Country </i>incorporates the collage structure 
        of its chief models, William Carlos Williams's <i>Paterson</i> and Charles 
        Olson's <i>Maximus Poems</i>. Like Rukeyser, however, Doubiago also found 
        sources for her epic poem in the immediate political movements of her 
        period. For Doubiago, a white author with working-class origins and Native 
        American ancestry, the women's movement of the 1970s provided a means 
        to connect her personal experience of sexism to both the Vietnam War and 
        the genocide of Native Americans. Briefly, <i>Hard Country</i> is partially 
        a monologue to a lover who has left, but Doubiago mythologizes her quest 
        for the lost lover, adopting personae including Isis, Ramona, La Llorona, 
        Psyche, and the bride in the Song of Songs to reveal the connection between 
        America's genocidal history and the male lover's denial of all that is 
        positioned in the culture as feminine. Doubiago's purposeful adoption 
        of the "feminine" and "working-class" position formerly imposed upon her 
        allows her to produce a powerful anti-imperialist poem of the land on 
        which the United States was founded. While Doubiago's speaker is closely 
        tied to the author, ghosts from the past and the present speak through 
        her. Doubiago imagines the aftermath of the massacre at Wounded Knee through 
        the eyes of an infant survivor and the atrocities of Vietnam through the 
        eyes of an American soldier who describes his own acts of torture. Thus, 
        rather than merely assuming a privileged and essentialized identity, the 
        main speaker of <i>Hard Country </i>moves between the individual voice 
        of a woman positioned as white in her culture and a more encompassing 
        mythic voice. Indeed, the poet-speaker of <i>Hard Country</i> finally 
        comes to understand not only her own suffering as a woman but also her 
        own role, and that of her ancestors, as an accomplice to her country's 
        crimes. </font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Doubiago's 
        concern with giving voice to what she calls the "Feminine I"&#150;with 
        recovering what has been omitted and silenced in official national history 
        and in personal relationships between men and women&#150;clearly shows 
        affinities with Fraser's and Howe's conceptions of their own feminist 
        projects. Doubiago shares with Howe in particular an immersion in historical 
        research and a use of documentary fragments, as well as an awareness that 
        "If you are a woman, archives hold perpetual ironies. Because the gaps 
        and silences are where you find yourself" (Howe, "<i>Talisman</i>" 158). 
        At the same time, Doubiago also actively recovers and <i>constructs</i> 
        powerful roles for women through her appropriation of didactic and narrative 
        qualities of the male modernist epic. <a href="#note10"><b><kbd>10</kbd></b></a> 
        <a name="back10"></a>For example, she defines her mission as a female 
        epic poet through the women who married into her father's family, whom 
        she envisions as preservers of the family history "against the fathers' 
        amnesia" (<i>Hard Country</i> 16). (The family name, Edens, signals a 
        larger symbolic significance of familial roles in <i>Hard Country</i>, 
        since "Eden" is the name explorers and settlers, especially in the South, 
        gave to the New World.) I should emphasize, however, that <i>Hard Country</i> 
        is not written as a linear narrative or a conventional argument; like 
        other modernist epics it is composed of intertextual collage, idiosyncratic 
        historical details, and recurring interwoven images. Readers must devote 
        significant effort in constructing and interpreting the text. Its combined 
        narrative of personal and political identity owes as much to Whitman as 
        to Adrienne Rich; its structure is inspired as much by Olson and Williams 
        as it is by the diary of Doubiago's paternal grandmother. Indeed, I want 
        to claim that <i>Hard Country</i> is "experimental" or "innovative" precisely 
        because it incorporates, but cannot be contained by, the conventions we 
        associate with the (male) modern American epic, the feminist avant-garde 
        text, and the feminist testimony from personal experience.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I would 
        like to close by returning to the 1997 MLA conversation among feminist 
        critics and women writers of long poems. In particular, I want to look 
        at a couple of exchanges between Fraser and Doubiago about the epic and 
        what Doubiago calls the "taboo" against the term. Initially, even Doubiago, 
        the participant in the conversation whose work is most obviously connected 
        with the epic projects of male modernists, insisted (laughing), "I have 
        never had an 'epic intention.'" But she clarified that her sense of the 
        "impossibility" of "epic" as a label for her work had to do with the term's 
        association with traditional notions of the "heroic," which, as she has 
        stated elsewhere, she finds "arrogant" ("Interview" 7). However, she went 
        on to discuss the "taboo" against using the word epic as "the prescription 
        not to connect" ("Contemporary Long Poem" 520-21). Fraser expressed an 
        opposite viewpoint as she spoke of teaching women students returning to 
        college to value the "fragmented, broken up, interrupted time that every 
        woman was going through," of creating "what you might call 'female forms'" 
        that would recognize "interruption" (524). But Doubiago spoke of teaching 
        a one-week workshop on &quot;&#145;epic poem&#146; writing&quot; (laughing 
        at the apparent absurdity of such an enterprise in that time frame!). 
        The workshop group, consisting of women and men, discussed the impulse 
        to engage in an epic project and the current taboo against it: "We all 
        understood that the censure of the epic in contemporary literature has 
        been healthy, but now&#150;a sort of post, post modernism&#150;this urge 
        comes up to put the fragments together in new kinds of stories and forms" 
        (521).</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While the 
        "female" aesthetic that Fraser describes, of fragments and interruptions, 
        is one important strain in women's twentieth-long poems, I hope that we 
        can also consider women's various creative attempts to connect the fragments. 
        An extreme postmodernist skepticism toward women's engagements with traditionally 
        male forms like the epic, or toward other feminist literary attempts at 
        overt persuasion in the public sphere, serves to narrow our appreciation 
        of the range of women's experimental writing and the legacy of female 
        modernists for present-day writers. I hope that our investigations of 
        women's relationship to the epic will move beyond the assumption of a 
        purely resistant or marginal position for the woman poet. We also need 
        to recognize women's agency in this evolving tradition, and in history.</font></p>

        Lynn Keller's "The Twentieth-Century Long Poem," in <i>The Columbia History 
        of American Poetry</i> (Ed. Jay Parini. New York: Columbia UP, 1993. 534-563), 
        is the only critical piece with which I am familiar, other than M.L. Rosenthal 
        and Sally Gall's <i>The Modern Poetic Sequence</i> (New York: Oxford UP, 
        1983), which includes Rukeyser in a study focused specifically on the 
        long poem, or on the epic, as a genre. (Rosenthal and Gall's brief treatment 
        of Rukeyser, incidentally, is quite troubling.) Keller recognizes one 
        of the key reasons for the omission of "The Book of the Dead" from previous 
        genre studies: "But this poem&#133; and others that followed were pigeonholed 
        as literature of social protest by an establishment that refused to see 
        aesthetic merit in topical political work" (541). Keller should also be 
        acknowledged for her insistence on incorporating poems from a wide range

        Brooks's <i>Annie Allen</i> should be read as a book-length poem. Structurally, 
        it differs greatly from "The Book of the Dead" (for example, <i>Annie 
        Allen</i>'s well-known second section, "The Anniad," is a long mock-heroic 
        narrative in complex stanzas based on Chaucer's rhyme royal). However, 
        I link Brooks and Rukeyser because both draw upon epic and modernist forms 
        to respond to current public issues in their communities, and both highlight 
        issues of women's authority in public discourse. <a href="#back2">[back

        The republication of <i>Hard Country</i> reminds us that even a modest 
        amount of critical attention can have a significant impact on the availability 
        of alternative writers' work. While <i>Hard Country</i>, during its years 
        out of print, remained a cherished book for a number of poets and political 
        activists, particularly on the West Coast, it was reissued by West End 
        Press (Albuquerque, New Mexico) largely because of the new attention the 
        book had begun to receive among academic readers of poetry. Important 
        recent publications dealing with <i>Hard Country</i> include Lynn Keller's 
        chapter in <i>Forms of Expansion</i>, "'To Remember / Our Dis-membered 
        Parts': Sharon Doubiago and the Complementary Woman's Epic," which originally 
        appeared in <i>American Literary History</i> (4 [1992]: 305-328). My interview 
        with Doubiago was published in <i>Contemporary Literature</i> (38 [1997]: 
        1-43), and my article titled "Bearing an Unbearable History: The Adoption 
        of the 'Feminine I' in Sharon Doubiago's <i>Hard Country</i>" appears 
        in the special issue of <i>Women's Studies</i> (27.5, 1998), edited by 
        Kathleen Crown, focusing on contemporary women's long poems. <a href="#back3">[back

        Keller emphasizes in Howe's own poems an "abiding concern with the processes 
        by which history's silences have been generated" (191). <a href="#back4">[back

        I should mention, however, that in the MLA roundtable, Howe spoke of "the 
        fearful price" Dickinson, H.D., and Woolf, "paid in their lives" ("Contemporary 
        Long Poem" 522). <a href="#back5">[back to text]</a></font></p>

        In referencing the emphasis on absence and subversiveness in discussions 
        of women's pre-1960 poetry, I am thinking here not only of postmodernist 
        readings of Dickinson and early twentieth-century female experimentalists 
        but also of Alicia Ostriker's opening chapter, titled "I'm Nobody: Women's 
        Poetry, 1650-1960," in her pioneering <i>Stealing the Language: The Emergence 
        of Women's Poetry in America</i> (Boston: Beacon, 1986). <a href="#back6">[back

        The phrase "a long road of presumption" occurs in Rukeyser's introduction 
        to her ambitious biography of Willard Gibbs, the nineteenth-century physicist 
        (<i>Willard Gibbs</i>. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Doran, 1942, p. 12). 
        Discussing the process of composing the biography, which is also a history 
        of the United States in the nineteenth century, Rukeyser refers to her 
        necessary transgressions, as a woman and a poet, into the regions of science 
        and technology, political life, and the investigation of America's past. 
        <a href="#back7">[back to text]</a> </font></p>

        Significantly, when he wrote this review, Williams was, according to Paul 
        Mariani's biography, "looking for leads for his own new work" (417)&#150;the 
        project that was to become <i>Paterson</i>. <a href="#back8">[back to

        I do not want to suggest that Rukeyser completely overcomes the difficulties 
        posed by women's marginal status in the epic tradition. I recognize that, 
        in attempting to revise perhaps the most profoundly masculine genre in 
        poetry, Rukeyser must inevitably participate in its disempowering as well 
        as its empowering conventions. In a chapter of my book in progress on 
        women and the epic, I note that in the title section of "The Book of the 
        Dead," in which Rukeyser attempts to represent a panorama of American 
        history, feminine imagery and Rukeyser's personal authority in relation 
        to her poetic argument become less apparent than in earlier sections. 
        However, she partially solves the problem of representing women as historical 
        agents by drawing upon the empowering version of Egyptian mythology that 
        she has constructed throughout her poem. <a href="#back9">[back to text]</a></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><a name="note10"></a><b>10</b>&nbsp; 
        I should underscore that this essay does not attempt to analyze Howe's, 
        or Fraser's, poetry but, rather, examines the ways in which both writers' 
        aesthetic statements illustrate limitations in currently prominent perspectives 
        identified with experimentalism. I am not claiming that these aesthetic 
        statements fully encompass the potential effects of either writer's poetry. 
        Indeed, in commentary that might complicate my brief comparison of Howe 
        and Doubiago, Keller sees in Howe's "The Liberties" (1980) a preoccupation 
        with "woman's agency, the constraints on it, and how these may translate 
        into her heroism" (220). <a href="#back10">[back to text]</a></font></p>
