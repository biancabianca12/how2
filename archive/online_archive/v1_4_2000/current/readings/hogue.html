        </span>Influence is a mysterious process of invitation, trust, and intuitive 
        intertextual engagement, as Kathleen Fraser's 1996 talk on her relationship 
        to H.D., &quot;The Empty Page: H.D.'s Invitation to Trust and Mistrust 
        Language,&quot; details.  The talk gives us a fascinating insight into 
        a postmodern woman poet's coming-to-consciousness of a &quot;lost&quot; 
        Modernist foremother.  As such, it provides the basis for what will be 
        my point of departure in this essay, that H.D. did not &quot;influence&quot; 
        Fraser, in the conventional sense of reading an older writer as model 
        in a young poet's formative years and absorbing (and denying) that predecessor's 
        style.  Rather, devoted to &quot;intellectual curiosity,&quot; productive 
        of an oeuvre that tracks and investigates process, that thoughtfully challenges 
        and linguistically reforms itself, Fraser encountered H.D. as &quot;enspiriting 
        guide&quot; at a crucial transitional period in her career.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></a><span>

        </span>The changes that feminist consciousness-raising brought about by 
        the 1970s enabled her to trust her own artistic intuition and to explore 
        possibilities of creative process which H.D. helped her to hear (in her 
        talk, Fraser repeatedly casts her response to hearing H.D. in terms of 
        trust).  As Fraser remarks about her long sequence, &quot;Etruscan Pages&quot; 
        (1993), for example, </font></p>

        face of all the officially recognized texts preceding me . . . including

        Absent from the college reading lists of the 1950s and 1960s (like most 
        of the other great female-authored Modernist texts), H.D.'s work was represented 
        in anthologies, if included at all, by a few of the early, Imagist poems 
        by which she often remained anthologized until quite recently.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup><span>[3]</span></sup></a><span> 
        <a name="back3"></a>   </span>In the New York of the 1960s, &quot;swarmed 
        as I was by every possible kind of intimate, innovative or jazzy poetic 
        example,&quot; Fraser simply couldn't &quot;<b>hear</b> H.D.'s voice.&quot;<a
href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup><span>[4]</span></sup></a><span> <a name="back4"></a> 
        </span>Moving to San Francisco by the end of the decade, however, Fraser 
        began to encounter H.D.'s voice indirectly, filtered through prominent 
        Black Mountain poets like Robert Duncan and Robert Creeley.<a href="#_edn5"
name="_ednref5" title=""><sup><span>[5]</span></sup></a><span> <a name="back5"></a>  
        </span>By the 1970s and 1980s, feminist critics revealed for Fraser &quot;a 
        different grid, a detour meant to <i>flaw</i> the convenient, intact, 
        uniform story of influence&quot;; their critical work helped Fraser to 
        understand H.D. in a way that opened up poetic possibilities:</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">H.D.'s 
        linking of &quot;hermetic&quot; assignations with &quot;secret language&quot; 
        and her conscious rejection of single-version narratives would become 
        central in helping to define my own poetic process. . . . I began <b>hearing</b> 
        her urgency and experiencing in her work a kind of female model or enspiriting 
        guide that I'd been lacking. . . . I finally understood that she used 
        the scaffolding of locked-up myth to <i>re</i>generate lopsided &quot;human&quot; 
        stories with a new infusion of the feminine. . . . There was a place to 
        put my trust.&quot;<a

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
        is clear that Fraser never aspired consciously to imitate H.D.'s honed, 
        signatory style.  Quite the contrary: &quot;The Empty Page&quot; celebrates 
        H.D. rather for her invitation <i>not</i> to imitate, for her <i>blanking 
        out</i> of inherited structures and her multiplying of &quot;single-version&quot; 
        fictions.  H.D. gives Fraser the poetic means to possess herself (&quot;enspirits&quot; 
        her), to generate her own poetic structures, in turn, helping her to define 
        and orient herself.  H.D. does not place <i>her</i> (as in locking her 
        into place, fixing her in relation to Eliotic Tradition), but gives her 
        a place <i>for</i> her &quot;trust.&quot;  This placement enables Fraser 
        to gain confidence in her own &quot;particular rendering.&quot;  She headily 
        celebrates H.D. for helping her to leap, as it were, into an emptiness 
        she also sees because of H.D.'s work (H.D.'s &quot;blank page&quot; emptied 
        of previous presence).</font></p>

        </span>In 1983, Kathleen Fraser founded <i>HOW(ever)</i>, a journal established 
        to bridge the gap between feminist scholars and experimental women poets, 
        providing a place for &quot;commentary on neglected [modernist/postmodernist] 
        women poets who were/are making textures and structures of poetry in the 
        tentative region of the untried.&quot;<a
href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup><span>[7]</span></sup></a><span> <a name="back7"></a> 
        </span>H.D. is discussed often in the journal's pages over its nine years 
        of publication, with entries by such major H.D. critic-poets as Rachel 
        Blau DuPlessis, Adelaide Morris, Barbara Guest, and Alicia Ostriker (among 
        others).  Volume 3 (October 1986) celebrates H.D.'s centennial year with 
        an issue &quot;of writings in which the sign, the mark, the utterance 
        of the unconscious comes through into present voice, with ancient echoes 
        hovering.&quot;<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup><span>[8]</span></sup></a><span> <a name="back8"></a> 
        </span>The issue includes a substantial list of publications honoring 
        H.D. (there were special issues, for example, of AGENDA and <i>The Iowa 
        Review</i>) as well as an announcement for an Emily Dickinson/H.D. Dual 
        Centennial Conference to be held at San Jose State University.  By <i>HOW(ever)</i>'s 
        final issue in 1992, Fraser quotes the lines alluded to above from <i>Trilogy</i> 
        (which were fast becoming feminism's <i>mots justes</i>); H.D. then gets

        an ongoing and ever-renewing &quot;invitation&quot; to pursue a new (&quot;untried&quot;)

        from <i>Trilogy</i>, is also employed as epigraph in &quot;The Empty Page,&quot; 
        in which Fraser spells out her sense that &quot;H.D. is issuing a <i>literal</i> 
        invitation.&quot;<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup><span>[9]</span></sup></a><span> <a name="back9"></a> 
        </span>In her opening paragraph, Fraser recontextualizes H.D.'s mystical 
        &quot;not-known&quot; (i.e. of esoteric wisdom), rendering it very specifically 
        the &quot;unsaid&quot; of one woman's historical experience.  Fraser thereby 
        leaps from epigraph about &quot;no rule&quot; to an opening discussion 
        which contemplates H.D.'s particular refusal of the pervasive, inherited 
        &quot;rules of procedure&quot; that surrounded her in her youth.  But 
        the epigraph that refers us to <i>Trilogy</i> also, we discover by perusing 
        <i>HOW(ever)</i>, refers us to an excerpt of Alicia Ostriker's essay on 
        H.D., &quot;No Rule of Procedure: H.D. and Open Poetics.&quot;<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup><span>[10]</span></sup></a><span> <a name="back10"></a>

        suggests that &quot;we are being <i>invited to trust</i> not a still point 
        outside of ourselves, transcending this world, but our own interiority&quot; 
        (emphasis added).  Astutely characterizing <i>Trilogy</i>'s paradoxical 
        formalism as &quot;neither rhymed nor not-rhymed,&quot; Ostriker goes 
        on to enumerate some of the many &quot;interior sound-echoes&quot;: </font></p>

        expectations that the reader rushes to fill. . . . Every rhyme invokes 
        the reader's consideration of semantic as well as sound similarities.&quot;

        of Marginality,&quot; of encountering a &quot;different kind of attentive 
        [in the works of postmodern women poets]: . . . a listening attitude,

        as well as announcements about scholarly and critical publications (some 
        excerpted briefly in <i>HOW[ever]</i>, like Ostriker's essay).  In addition 
        to some of the very specific reconsiderations and astute formal analyses 
        of H.D.'s work, there are myriad kinds of other references: fascinating, 
        informal scholarship (one entry by Virginia Smyers, for example, the librarian 
        cataloging Bryher's books, detailing Smyers' discovery of H.D.'s annotations 
        of a book on Christian mysticism [October 1986]); an extension of H.D.'s 
        primary methodology to her poet-biographer in a lovely &quot;Palimpsest 
        for Barbara Guest,&quot; by Dale Going (Summer 1991); even H.D.'s response 
        to a 1929 questionnaire &quot;What would you most like to do . . . ?&quot; 
        (H.D. was making films at time: &quot;I should like more than anything 
        to . . . . . . wander in and about Italian and Swiss hills making light 
        do what I want&quot; [April 1988]).  I suggest that the layers of such 
        references, in the context of the flowering of Second Wave and poststructuralist 
        feminist scholarship on H.D. and other women writers, as well as feminist 
        experimental writing in the 1980s, comprise a sort of cultural palimpsest, 
        in H.D.'s sense of the term.  </font></p>

        poem in ten parts, entitled &quot;WING.&quot;  As Fraser details in a

        levels&quot; of social and historical context (several of which remind 
        us of H.D.'s traumatic residence in London during the Blitz): the illness 
        and death of a close friend from AIDS; two exhibits by artist Mel Bochner 
        in Rome (one at the <i>Museo Storico della Liberazione</i>) that caused 
        Fraser to ruminate about Italian Fascist and Nazi imprisonment of Jews, 
        Gypsies, and resistance fighters during World War II; the archeo/logical 
        remnants of imperial Roman history evident in the architectural layers 
        of Roman walls (becoming Fraser's palimpsestic <i>arche/text</i>); and 
        (perhaps the most unconscious coincidence of Fraser with H.D.'s <i>Trilogy</i>) 
        Fraser's fascination from childhood with the spiritual iconography of

          teaching in the east, Creeley spent half of every year around San Francisco 
          throughout the 1970s.  My own initial exposure to H.D. occurred, as 
          a matter of fact, in the spring of 1974, when at SUNY/Buffalo, I took 
          an independent study with Creeley, who gave me his 1973 New Directions 
          edition of <i>Trilogy</i>, mentioning that I might be interested in 
          H.D.'s work.  I have cherished the gift for many years now, although 
          we never talked about H.D.'s poetry, and it was never taught in his 
          American Modernism class (which focussed on Pound, Williams, and Olson).
