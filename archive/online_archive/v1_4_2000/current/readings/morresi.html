        pages are part of a work-in-progress on Nancy Cunard. If by “progress” 
        is meant gradual approach to the complete knowledge of the object of study, 
        my work has not “progressed” much. But I’ve been lucky: Cunard is not 
        an object, she is not a fixed, clear-cut entity I have to discover removing 
        a mass of useless data. She’s more an underground stream, crossing numerous 
        fields, growing wider or rarrower, trying to seep wherever possible, slowly, 
        but constantly, eroding the rock.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At 
        the very beginning of my research on Cunard, I found innumerable descriptions, 
        reports, images, memoirs, photographs. I believed that by collecting all 
        pieces and putting them together in a single frame I could reach a full 
        vision.  And yet I soon realized that, though I could always create new 
        images, I could never find THE image. As with a tangram.Where was the 
        mistake? In the splitting? Or was it in that search after the stable, 
        univocal truth that could make sense of all differences? </font></p>

line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
        considering Cunard transformations, even contradictions must be taken 
        into account. In the shifting interstitial space of negotiation among 
        different cultural formations she becomes a crucible of meanings, the 
        site where some visions of the world meet and others originate. There 
        she gains her authoritative voice.Cunard’s dispute with western hegemonies, 
        her fight against racism and colonialism, her struggles on behalf of the 
        working-classes, her active anti-fascism, her work for the acknowledgement 
        of black identity, for the circulation of black cultures and histories, 
        somehow even her silences, build up the possibility of troubling whiteness, 
        altering traditional representations and gender roles, opening new perspectives.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Her 
        intentions have long remained misunderstood, her name unmarked, her work 
        unintelligible. As Mae G. Henderson says, it’s necessary “to rescue and 
        find a historical home for this fascinating figure, suppressed in one 
        tradition and falsified in another.” Rescuing Cunard has become part of 
        a plan to trouble disciplines (and identities) considered as absolute 
        monolithic entities. Cunard always tried to cut out for herself a location 
        where she could represent blacks and persuade whites, where she could 
        do away with white imperialist culture and yet be heard by it, be approved 
        as a political partner by blacks, criticize black moderatism, put together 
        radical intellectuals, political leaders, black and white artists, and 
        be a poet herself. </font></p>

            his execution. [...] the African has an adequate enough soul (somewhat 
            different from yours) and had also (though that too was different

line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Cunard 
        acknowledges racial difference, but has trouble reconciling it with the 
        claim for complete equality. She’s aware of the distinctiveness of race, 
        but in recording black cultures -in trying to have them acknowledged by 
        whites as cultures—she often feels impelled to construct them in terms 
        of white western cultural norms (stressing the formal artistry, the social 
        organization, etc.)</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        her work she often tends to erase her whiteness, to construct for herself 
        an insider quality that can make her pass for black. In so doing she risks 
        the reproduction of those hegemonic practises she wants to oppose: her 
        appropriation of black struggles may conceal the traditional western will-to-domination. 
        Moreover, stepping outside whiteness often means for her stepping outside 
        her gender. “When on SELF writing RE the three main things: equality of 
        races, of sexes, of classes.” In her discourse of equality Cunard tries 
        to erase differences, with the result of subsuming them in ‘the norm’. 
        As Maureen Moynagh argues: “The gender lacuna in effect comes as an aporia 
        in Cunard’s writing on race, persistently undermining her efforts to speak 
        from a place outside imperialist discourse.” On the other hand Cunard’s 
        refusal of whiteness is only partial: as a white protester against white 
        racism she had the chance to articulate a far more radical voice then 
        any black representative was allowed to do in those troubled times: </font></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Cunard 
        was a British heiress in favour of radical communism, a white aristocrat 
        fighting against all forms of imperial oppression throughout the world: 
        she was not content to patronize, her revolutionary spirit was all for 
        action. On the other side, as a woman activist, she was not interested 
        in the status of women, a fact which has discouraged feminists’s interest 
        in studying her politics. Significantly enough Cunard has often been described 
        in terms of an aggressive (heterosexual) sexuality: her relations have 
        received attention only when concerning men, her connections with women 
        being confined to competition. But it was Edith Sitwell who first published 
        her poems in the anthology <i>Wheels</i>; her <i>Parallax</i> was published 
        by the Hogarth Press; she wrote for the New Times of Sylvia Pankhurst. 
        Janet Flanner, Solita Solano, Kay Boyle, Sylvia Townsend Warner seemed 
        to be life-long friends. Cunard interviewed Una Marson, she published 
        Laura Riding at the Hours Press, and later Zora Neale Hurston in the <i>Negro</i> 
        anthology.  Her multiple, creative links with other women will repay a 
        distinct study.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        don’t think it’s by chance that images and representations of Cunard stop 
        at the first half of the ‘30s, when it became clear that her political 
        and civic activity was not the whim of a spoilt child. When Cunard stopped 
        being seen as the rebel and eccentric upper-class girl and strived to 
        establish herself as a radical activist, serious in her political concerns, 
        she disappeared from popular imagination. In <i>Brave Poet, Indomitable 
        Rebel</i>, the book Hugh Ford edited and dedicated to Cunard soon after 
        her death, Cunard’s distinguished friends and acquaintences tend to describe 
        her in terms of a mythical, almost mystical sexuality. Other biographers 
        give central importance to this element in their interpretations of her 
        life and work. Douglas describes her as “a glamorous, alcoholic British 
        heiress, poet, rebel and profligate” and examines the reasons of her thinness, 
        her sexual preferences, the contrast with her mother. Cunard’s interest 
        in the black cause is considered the sublimation of her own maternal instict, 
        frustrated by her mother’s bad example.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Chisholm 
        appeals first to glandular, then to mental disorder to justify Cunard’s 
        choices. She also underlines how many people describe her “as if she were 
        a martyr or an ascetic who undertook sex as a kind of ordeal or torture, 
        finding a voluptuous pleasure in degrading herself. To those who looked 
        to a deeper kind of purity, a kind of self-sacrifice, seemed to lie behind 
        her wild behaviour.”</font></p>

line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Studies 
        on Cunard have too often been limited to her sexuality and the problematic 
        relation with her mother. Such analyses have obscured her role as a political 
        organizer, journalist and writer. bell hooks gives an effective description 
        of this well-known strategy to suppress women’s writing and intellectual 
        activity: </font></p>

            our culture, women of all races and classes who step out on the edge, 
            courageously resisting conventional norms for female behavior, are

            of “mad” women excite even as they comfort. Set apart, captured in 
            a circus of raging representations, women’s serious cultural rebellion 
            is mocked, belittled, trivialized. It is frustrating, maddening even, 
            to live in a culture where female creativity and genius are almost 
            always portrayed as inherently flawed, dangerous, problematic.</font></td>

line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        morbid attention on Cunard’s sexuality is the more striking if we consider 
        that Cunard herself doesn’t directly address sexual or gender issues. 
        Finding no genderized discourse in her agenda of anti-racist struggles 
        is, at first, discouraging. We wonder why this woman, so clever at bringing 
        to light the intersecting dynamics of imperialism, capitalism and racism, 
        didn’t realize that imperial hegemonies were imbued with a patriarchal 
        attitude and sexism. If Cunard overlooked the gender question, a careful 
        reading of her work must take it into account: the missing gender issue 
        in Cunard’s discourse doesn’t allow neglecting gender as a fundamental 
        category in her politics, exactly because of its<i> absence</i>.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
        becomes clearer then why in Cunard’s poetry the first person narrator 
        is repeatedly a (white or black) male subject, why her accusation and 
        repudiation of British imperialism and racism are articulated through 
        Cunard’s public rejection of her mother and her feminine ideal, why Cunard 
        always chose male life-styles and never spent a word to explain or justify 
        her choices in personal terms. Unlike Bryer, the other well-known British 
        heiress with a central role in the literary scene of the age and in anti-fascism, 
        Cunard never wrote a biography giving direct account of her motives. She 
        didn’t mingle personal, public and political that much, after all.  </font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It’s 
        often repeated that <i>Black Man and White Ladyship</i>, the first text 
        Cunard wrote to claim the value of Afro-American culture and expose racism, 
        “broke the taboo of privacy”. The pamphlet has been considered a shocking 
        attack on her mother, an excessive retaliation, a violation of the sacred 
        mother-daughter bond, a public declaration of her love for an Afro-American 
        man. I don’t think this reading of the text is enough: Cunard’s operation 
        must be read inside her politics, as a real political act, not just as 
        a violent outburst and a personal revelation. It’s true that the personal 
        implications are relevant, but I don’t think they were Cunard’s main concern 
        when writing the pamphlet. First of all in <i>Black Man and White Ladyship</i> 
        there’s no hint that the relation between Cunard and her “Negro friend” 
        was more than a close friendship. When ‘The Afro-American’ published the 
        pamphlet substituting the word “lover” for “friend,” Cunard replied with 
        an annoyed letter where she made clear that the implications of her pamphlet 
        didn’t necessarily depend on the nature upon her relation with Crowder. 
        I’m sure Lady Cunard and her clan held a very different opinion.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the whole text the only words that state the gender of the narrator are 
        those pronounced by Lady Cunard “Is it true that my daughter knows a Negro?”. 
        Her mother is never called “my mother”, she is always referred to as “Her 
        Ladyship”: she’s kept at a distance and mercilessly scrutinized. The habits 
        of a high-society woman, like the frantic consumerism or the feigned feminine 
        candour, become the symbol of western ‘uncivilized civilization’, but 
        there’s hardly anything about the mother as a mother at all. When Cunard 
        tells about the widespread violence in the southern states of U.S., where 
        lynchings are encouraged “In the name of white American womanhood!,” some 
        light could be thrown upon white anxieties over miscegenation, black access 
        to citizenship, white women’s independence. But she stops just there where 
        I would like her to begin: “I think one can explain the Virginian in two 
        words: Fear and jealousy.” Even in her reports on lynching and the Scottsboro 
        case, Cunard doesn’t explore the implications of rape, “the American white 
        southerners’ vocal badge of race-hatred,” for (white and black) women.  
        She resists talking about women and about herself as a woman.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Black 
        Man and White Ladyship</i> is certainly not the nasty trick of a rebellious 
        daughter: it was written when Cunard was 35 and had been on distant terms 
        with her mother for many years. The pamphlet exposes American lynching 
        practises, the atrocity of slavery, the persistence of the Colour Bar, 
        the blindness of intellectuals, the hypocrisy of an outdated aristocracy 
        afraid of losing its empire. It states Cunard’s new set of values, the 
        desire to construct for herself a new identity. It presents a black man 
        who is different from the common stereotype of the “down-trodden canticle-singing 
        Negro” and is described as “the very much up to date, well educated, keen, 
        determined man of action”. The roles are inverted: the “supposedly well 
        educated arts-and-letters-appreciating aristocrats and hostesses” become 
        ignorant, superficial, vulgar and outdated; the black man becomes modern, 
        brave, loyal, clever and creative. The pamphlet also marks the beginning 
        of Cunard’s work in recovering, studying and circulating black histories 
        and cultures.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
        these and other reasons I  believe that <i>Black Man and White Ladyship</i> 
        is primarily a political manifesto. It was the age of manifestos, after 
        all, and Cunard followed the example of her surrealist friends, even adopting 
        a certain surrealist style (think of the opposition old\new, the shocking 
        element, the juxtaposition of different scenes, the parody). The pamphlet 
        is the rejection of the traditional, snobbish, racist, closed world of 
        British imperialist upper-classes, and of Lady Cunard, who was the perfect 
        embodiment of its ideal of womanhood.</font></p>

        from the censorship of what could question one’s image (“Her Ladyship 
        has just thrown this 25/- worth of modern history into the fire and with 
        a poker holds it down”), to the erasure of otherness turning it into familiar 
        categories (“if the black man is Paul Robeson . . . ah then it is quite 
        different, he becomes ‘the noble Moor’ ”), from the use of art to increase 
        status (“the Art game or Picture racket”), to the refusal to speak about 
        controversial subjects, like homosexuality (“ ‘You know, those dreadful 
        people who . . . well, you know those horrid . . .’ ”).</font></p>

        exile from her mother and motherland is, with Jane Marcus’s words, an 
        “exultant exile”, different from the experiences of melanchonic homelessness 
        and alienation that have come to characterize (and glamorize) the lives 
        of modernist émigrés. Her interest in black cultures may not always be 
        “pure,” free from western exoticism, yet her commitment is not just to 
        the individual quest of inspiration and self-fulfilment, but, above all, 
        is an the effort to make those cultures the sites of cultural production 
        themselves.  Her idea of modern(ist) culture raises many questions and 
        contradictions: it’s maybe there that we should start to tell the story 
        again.</font></p>
