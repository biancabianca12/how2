            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Against a background of American lyricism devoted to the self, 
        Language writing has been particularly active in deconstructing individualist 
        trends in the cultural production of literature, as well as attempting, 
        in various ways, to rethink community. The very term, Language writing—or 
        Language poetry as it is also called—has been used to identify a group 
        formation of writers as well as the body of poetic writing that they produced 
        during the seventies and eighties. While many have found the tag itself 
        to be limiting, the sharing of a writing practice was generally embraced. 
        In a remark that was typical for many, Joan Retallack states: “My sense 
        of the value of my work must exist in community, must be validated by 
        others whose opinion I respect, must be tied to (perhaps an illusion of) 
        social implication, which I can equate to the implications for the Language 
        and the Literature...feeling that I am part of a project which generates 
        new possibilities.”<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note9">9</a> 
        <a name="back9"></a> </span></sup></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Language 
        writing communities emerged in San Francisco’s Bay Area, Washington, DC, 
        and New York City. Although not all knew or necessarily had met one another, 
        a healthy small-press culture generated a sense of intensity. Owing to 
        generational and aesthetic differences, several writers, such as Kathleen 
        Fraser, Clark Coolidge, and Michael Palmer, were involved in other poetry 
        formations and created an independent space for themselves. Yet their 
        interactions or tensions with Language writing would indelibly shape its 
        subsequent projects.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Language 
        writers were concerned not so much with describing the world as with interrogating 
        the possibilities of the social. The public nature of Language writing 
        stands in direct contrast to the privacy of the workshop poem and its 
        therapeutic enabling of the individual. Whereas the workshop poem constructs 
        the poet as self-determining viewer of the world, Language writing emphasizes 
        the existence of “multiple conflicting perspectives.”<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note10">10</a></span></sup> 
        <a name="back10"></a>Furthermore, it seeks to understand how relations 
        of power that inform the everyday are disseminated and veiled through 
        language. While some male Language writers focused on the dangers of commodity 
        fetishism, an equal number of women writers took gender as an object of 
        critique. Carla Harryman, for instance, agrees with Shulamith Firestone’s 
        fundamental premise in The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution 
        that women’s oppression is linked to sexual difference. Although it matters 
        what form she writes in, what matters more is a commitment to challenging 
        how women are currently valued and positioned in society.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note11">11</a></span></sup> 
        <a name="back11"></a>Much of her poetic game-play and narrative switches 
        displaces conventional sexual roles and their concomitant positions of 
        knowledge and power.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Susan 
        Howe argues that in looking at the terrain of poetry we should ask the 
        following questions: “Who polices questions of grammar, parts of speech, 
        connection, and connotation? Whose order is shut inside the structure 
        of a sentence?”<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note12">12</a></span></sup> 
        <a name="back12"></a>Language writing undermines interpretative codes 
        by self-consciously playing against ingrained habits of reading. The poem 
        reflects upon itself “not only at the level of represented ideas but prosodically, 
        acoustically, syntactically, visibly; which is to say gives these dimensions 
        equal methodological weight as it gives to more traditional notions of 
        semantic content.”<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note13">13</a> 
        <a name="back13"></a> </span></sup></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At 
        a more general level, Language writing also critiques the boundaries of 
        the poem. It challenges formal distinctions between verse and prose, literature 
        and philosophy, aesthetics and politics. In radicalizing the space of 
        its proper object, it overflows into other genres, like talks, essays, 
        politics, and psychology. Alternatively, other genres may spill into poetry. 
        Co-founded by Eileen Corder, Carla Harryman, and Nick Robinson, The Poets 
        Theater (1978–84) involved many Bay Area Language writers. All three, 
        along with Alan Bernheimer, Bob Perelman, and Kit Robinson would write 
        and take part in plays. Leslie Scalapino would also write and direct plays, 
        while Susan Howe’s own background in the theater is continually brought 
        to bear on her poetry. Another perhaps obvious crossing is between language 
        and music, with Clark Coolidge and Joan Retallack exploring, in quite 
        different ways, the possibilities of sound through complex linguistic, 
        rhythmic, and spatial experimentation.<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note14">14</a> 
        <a name="back14"></a> </span></sup></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
        opening up the poetic, Language writers foreground the gap between “what 
        one wants to say...and what one can say.”<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note15">15</a></span></sup> <a name="back15"></a>Accordingly, 
        the poem offers up the possibility of collaboration. Rather than simply 
        consuming the text, the reader participates with the writer in its meaning 
        production. However, there is always a danger that the degree of required 
        attention may alienate a reader. In facing this concern, Retallack wonders 
        if:</font></p>
      <table width="497" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>

            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">some 
              of the forms we invent to sabotage the cliché...may in fact have 
              the very effect on the reader we are trying to avoid: shutting her 
              out to all but her own fantasies, sliding away from an engagement 
              that can be argued with, resisted, or even accepted as genuinely 
              nourishing. Are we creating victims of language when the field of 
              discourse is so idiosyncratic (private), the reader must either 
              wholly capitulate to our designs or retreat?—when we reject common 
              fields of discourse in which, after all, people live and work as 
              too corrupt for our linguistic act are we literally disarming the 
              reader?<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note16">16</a>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Yet 
        it is precisely this risk that distinguishes Language writing as a mode 
        of feminist exploration. Indeed, its poetics stands in direct contrast 
        to much of the feminist poetry produced out of the women’s movement. During 
        the seventies, many second-wave feminists sought to bring poetic language 
        closer to common usage in order to “make it more accessible to ordinary 
        women.”<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note17">17</a></span></sup> 
        <a name="back17"></a>The poem’s content was privileged as a source for 
        messages that would help build a feeling of collective experience and 
        empowerment. In its combination of the personal and the communal, such 
        poetry would become a vehicle by which many women from African American, 
        Chicana, and Native American backgrounds, as well as lesbian identifications, 
        could at last feel confident enough to express their feelings of difference. 
        Female experiences of motherhood and sexuality were also articulated and 
        affirmed.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">However, 
        the relation of language to dominant systems of knowledge was not fully 
        recognized as a matter of concern. As Cynthia G. Franklin points out, 
        identity politics and poststructuralism were often placed in opposition 
        to one another.<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note18">18</a></span></sup> 
        <a name="back18"></a>Innovative poetry remained isolated and even suspect 
        within many feminist circles, leading Fanny Howe to declare with some

              a time when women as writers are being given the big break—equal 
              time and interest—there seems to be little focus on the work by 
              women which is aesthetically new...The content of women’s work is 
              constantly studied, often by other women, without nearly enough 
              attention paid to the form of that work and why, when the form is 
              new, this newness is intricately tied to the newness of the content.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note19">19</a>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        order to publish, innovative women writers were forced to start their 
        own presses or journals. Kelsey St. Press became a leading example of 
        this, established by its six editors—Karen Brodine, Patricia Dienstfrey, 
        Kit Duane, Marina La Palma, Laura Moriarty, and Rena Rosenwasser—in order 
        to give the “writing by women we valued a place.”<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note20">20</a></span></sup><i><a name="back20"></a>HOW(ever)</i> 
        (founded by Kathleen Fraser and coedited initially by Beverly Dahlen and 
        Frances Jaffer) provided a more frequent and open forum for innovative 
        poetry by women, as well as offering a space for exchange and critique. 
        Around the same time, Lyn Hejinian founded Tuumba Press, featuring writers 
        such as Fraser, Susan Howe, and Barbara Baracks in the first series. And 
        on the East Coast, Maureen Owen started <i>Telephone</i> magazine after 
        realizing that “a lot of women were around...who were writing seriously, 
        [but who] weren’t getting published anywhere.”<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note21">21</a></span></sup> <a name="back21"></a>Alongside 
        the proliferating print culture, Susan Howe began a radio program, Poetry, 
        which brought together her love of innovative poetics and an interest 
        in feminist inquiry. Many of these ventures grounded or ran concurrently 
        with Language writing projects, ensuring a rich cross-fertilization of 
        ideas.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Tied 
        to issues of form, many innovative writers found themselves battling the 
        underlying assumption of consensus in sisterhood. Attracted initially 
        to second-wave feminism in the early seventies, Hannah Weiner found her 
        poetic interests increasingly distanced from the “representative” voice 
        espoused by feminism.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note22">22 
        </a><a name="back22"></a></span></sup> Likewise, Harryette Mullen gained 
        inspiration from white academic feminists but simultaneously discovered 
        her own experiences as an African American marginal to their project. 
        She found in Language writing a way in which to negotiate the complexity 
        of subjectivity and identification, using its opacity and play to develop 
        a “mongrelized” poetics that derails gender and racial boundaries.<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note23">23</a></span></sup><a name="back23"></a>Mullen 
        engaged with Language writing in the mid-eighties, just as it began attracting 
        institutional attention. At roughly the same time, mainstream feminism 
        started debating identity politics and difference feminism. Gloria Anzaldúa’s 
        groundbreaking <i>Borderlands/La Frontera</i>: <i>The New Mestiza</i> 
        would not be published until 1987.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note24">24</a> <a name="back24"></a></span></sup></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some 
        critics, such as Charles Altieri, have suggested that Language writing 
        is in danger of becoming another sort of modernist formalism, “blind to 
        historical forces and refusing to take responsibility for the political 
        conditions created by those forces.”<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note25">25</a></span></sup><a name="back25"></a>As 
        he discerns, an urgent task is how to address political pressures and 
        hear voices from the margins. While this remains a crucial issue, Language 
        writers have sought to merge an aesthetic practice with a broader cultural 
        awareness. A critique of political structures underscores many of their 
        poetic projects, although these may not take the usual narrative forms. 
        Many women writers have focused on how violent past histories remain a 
        source of loss, shame, and ambivalence—including Leslie Scalapino’s immersion 
        in the media coverage of the Gulf War and Susan Howe’s, Rosmarie Waldrop’s, 
        and Hannah Weiner’s complex and quite different investigations into the 
        relationship between colonial and linguistic power in American history. 
        For many years, Joan Retallack has developed a practice of “poethics,” 
        designed to plumb history’s unintelligible silences.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        emergence of Language writing should also be contextualized against the 
        call for civil rights, the women’s movement, the failure of the European 
        intellectual community in 1968, and reactions to the Vietnam War. Such 
        contexts are not discrete but overlapping, because each challenged the 
        intellectual project by questioning its representative capacity as well 
        as the constituency of communities. Tina Darragh states:</font></p>

              terms—we don’t seem to be learning anything about our mistakes, 
              plus we seem like shells in the face of rising militarism, without 
              the desire to unite with others or challenge individually what’s

              ourselves as social beings by illuminating the differences between 
              how private language and public language operate in our lives, how

        be recidivist, that is, naming and performing a shared political practice 
        at the very moment when the modern community is in crisis. As Naomi Schor 
        and others have pointed out, feminism has also been framed as a recidivist 
        project in that it foregrounds a particular form of difference (sexual

        the order of the community at large. In San Francisco in particular, Language 
        writing attracted notoriety. Tom Clark’s article berating Language writing 
        in a 1985 issue of <i>Poetry Flash</i> ran with the headline, “Stalin 
        as Linguist,” its very title projecting an image of Communist monster.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note28">28</a></span></sup>

        <a name="back29"></a>Again, when a number of Bay Area writers attempted 
        to argue their relation to one another as an affinity rather than an identity,

        make it much easier to ignore them as marginal. Throughout the seventies 
        and early eighties, Language writing remained sidelined by arts funding 
        systems, the academy, and a broader reading public. Indeed, the editors 
        of <i>The Morrow Anthology of Younger American Poets</i> (1985), an anthology 
        typical of the era, described the younger American poet as follows: “[H]e 
        is rarely a card-carrying group member, political or aesthetic.”<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note32">32 
        </a><a name="back32"></a></span></sup>> If this is the case, Rae Armantrout 
        argues, then the new American poet is someone with no multicultural, ethnic, 
        class, or gender politics. The image such an anthology projected was of 
        “an oppressive machismo,” the individual standing alone as poetic frontiersman.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note33">33</a></span></sup>> 
        <a name="back33"></a>Armantrout wrote of another anthology (<i>19 New 
        American Poets of The Golden Gate</i>) published a year earlier by Harcourt 
        Brace: “[I]t features mostly academic poets, listing all their grants 
        and jobs. It brought home to me how sidelined ‘we’ really are–how far 
        from the centers of power, how apt to be forgotten.”<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note34">34</a> <a name="back34"></a></span></sup></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many 
        mainstream feminist poets at the time also suffered from this form of 
        indirect dismissal. Only when writers like Audre Lorde and Alice Walker 
        and, later, Judy Grahn, Minnie Bruce Pratt, and Rita Dove began winning 
        prizes and endorsement from the poetry establishment did this begin to 
        change.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
        Language writing became anthologized during the mid-eighties, its existence 
        in terms of community was already dissolving. It was becoming institutionally 
        accepted, gaining the support of influential critics such as Marjorie 
        Perloff, Jerome McGann, and Andrew Ross. As the use of the term Language 
        poetry or Language writing gained currency, it, in turn, inevitably began 
        to subsume difference and marginalize other innovative poetries. At the 
        same time, Language writers began to explore other community formations. 
        Some writers took up academic positions; others took on professional roles 
        in publishing, librarianship and communications. Many would turn to family 
        life. In the late eighties and nineties, a proliferation of critical articles 
        and books appeared that focused specifically on Language writing. Most 
        characterized Language writing as a literary movement, complete with leading 
        representatives and manifestoes.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
        mapping out Language writing through this familiar narrative, critics 
        have duplicated mythologies of genius and hierarchized participation in 
        terms of sexual difference. Even well-known literary histories such as 
        Bob Perelman’s <i>The Marginalization of Poetry</i> (1996) and Michael 
        Davidson’s account in <i>The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and 
        Poetics</i> (1993) have tended to shift women’s work to the margins—Perelman 
        devoting half a chapter to women Language writers and briefly mentioning 
        them in others, while Davidson names only Hejinian in his summary of its 
        history.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note35">35</a></span></sup> <a name="back35"></a>Anthologies, 
        too, are marked by amnesia as well as already interpreting what they display. 
        “Language” Poetries (1987) showcases only a few “stars” of Language writing, 
        and <i>In the American Tree: Language, Realism, Poetry</i> (1986) was 
        constructed through Silliman’s highly partial reading of Language writing 
        aesthetics.<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note36">36</a></span></sup> 
        <a name="back36"></a>Finally, Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris’s massive 
        <i>Poems for the Millennium: The University of California book of Modern 
        and Postmodern Poetry</i> (1998) sets up a complicated alignment of writers 
        under headings such as “Some ‘Language’ Poets.”<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note37">37</a><a name="back37"></a></span></sup> 
        In doing so, it fails to include women writers who threaten genre boundaries 
        in their work, such as Bernadette Mayer, Fanny Howe, and Johanna Drucker. 
        In centralizing poetic formations, Washington DC writers are also effectively 
        elided.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the study of literary movements, the fetishizing of theory has enabled 
        critics to contain innovative poetry and neutralize it along canonical 
        lines. This has certainly been the case with Language writing. Throughout 
        the past two decades, a select number of male Language writers have had 
        their critical work published by eminent university presses. Although 
        their own poetry would sometimes be overshadowed by the authority invested 
        in these volumes, the poetry of their female counterparts remained an 
        object of study through these same theoretical frameworks. Such methodological 
        divisions could only be reductive for Language writers of either gender.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        critical reception of Language writing has therefore tended to represent 
        women as secondary participants or its passive benefactors. From an alternative 
        angle, feminist critics have also overlooked their work. In <i>The Feminist 
        Poetry Movement</i>, Kim Whitehead looks more at identity politics than 
        at linguistic subversion in constructing a single feminist poetic tradition.<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note38">38</a></span></sup> 
        <a name="back38"></a>This is reinforced from an unlikely quarter in Rachel 
        Blau DuPlessis’s and Ann Snitow’s <i>The Feminist Memoir Project: Voices 
        from Women’s Liberation</i>.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note39">39</a><a name="back39"></a></span></sup> 
        Although DuPlessis has long been an enthusiastic practitioner and advocate 
        of innovative women’s writing, such voices are absent in this volume’s 
        representation of a single movement in sisterhood. Alternatively, Cynthia 
        Franklin fails to mention the blurred genre work of many Language writers 
        in <i>Writing Women’s Communities: The Politics and Poetics of Contemporary 
        Multi-Genre Anthologies</i>—perhaps assuming a community of sameness rather 
        than of diversity.<sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note40">40</a> 
        <a name="back40"></a> </span></sup></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
        some degree, this double marginalization is now being reversed. While 
        Language writing is still undervalued in its feminist potential, women’s 
        contributions to Language writing have been increasingly recognized and 
        celebrated in the past few years. Some have referred to this period as 
        the second front of Language writing, although this risks dissolving the 
        radicalism of the alternative narratives now being produced.<sup><span style='font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note41">41</a></span></sup> <a name="back41"></a>Early 
        books of Bernadette Mayer and Lyn Hejinian have been reprinted—Mayer’s 
        <i>Midwinter Day</i> appearing under the New Directions imprint and Hejinian’s 
        <i>Writing Is an Aid to Memory</i> appearing as part of the Sun &amp; 
        Moon classics series. Wesleyan University Press increasingly supports 
        innovative women’s writing, its list including poets such as Kathleen 
        Fraser, Susan Howe, Joan Retallack, and Leslie Scalapino. The University 
        of California Press is also ensuring a reputation as a publisher of the 
        avant-garde with essay collections by Hejinian and Retallack.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note42">42</a></span></sup>> 
        <a name="back42"></a>Furthermore, the University of Alabama has recently 
        published Fraser’s <i>Translating the Unspeakable: Poetry and the Innovative 
        Necessity</i> and will be publishing a collection of papers on women’s 
        small press publishing (a volume emerging out of the “PageMothers” conference 
        organized by Rae Armantrout and Fanny Howe in 1999).&nbsp;<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><a name="back43"></a>Most 
        significant is the recent publication of two anthologies structured around 
        gender. Like the recent Norton anthology on African American literature, 
        <i>Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North 
        America</i> and the UK (1996) and <i>Moving Borders: Three Decades of 
        Innovative Writing by Women</i> (1998) signal a major redress to literary 
        history.<sup><span style='font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note44">44</a></span></sup> <a name="back44"></a>While 
        <i>Out of Everywhere</i> draws parallels between British and American 
        innovative women’s writing, <i>Moving Borders</i> opens the field within 
        North America. At over seven hundred pages, it gives a detailed mapping 
        of innovative women’s poetry as well as foregrounding the feminist issues 
        through which such poetry is written.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Mary 
        Margaret Sloan, notes that in editing the anthology, it was clear how 
        much a work of writing is not the result of a solitary act but the end 
        effect of a multitude of social activities, the most important of which 
        is reading. We read and are read, and that mutual consideration folds 
        us into a conversation which affects everything about us as writers: our 
        aesthetic choices, certainly, but also where we will publish and what 
        kinds of rewards we receive.<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><a href="#note45">45</a><a name="back45"></a></span></sup></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
        Sloan suggests, what remains to be done is to contextualize poetry as 
        both text and practice. A genealogy undertakes such a double-barreled 
        process. Leaving <i>Lines of Gender: A Feminist Genealogy of Language 
        Writing</i> offers an alternative to reductive originary narratives, that 
        read Language writing through a few major sources, such as Ron Silliman’s 
        anthology, <i>In the American Tree</i>, and Bruce Andrews and Charles 
        Bernstein’s <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i>. Rather than proposing an organic model 
        of growth or a model of equivalence, a genealogy explores the shifting 
        “mess” that encapsulates actual poetic practice through the traces it 
        leaves. It maps out the interweaving, multiple lines of affiliation as 
        well as the debates arising out of difference, whether these be regional, 
        aesthetic, cultural or ideological. As the title suggests, this book explores 
        not only the signs of gender in women’s poetic practice (including practices 
        of publishing, editing, readings, talks, and collaborations), but also 
        how gender’s prescribed tracks have been variously challenged or left 
        behind.</font></p>

        a review of Maggie O’Sullivan’s 1996 anthology, <i>Out of Everywhere: 
        Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North America and the UK</i>, 
        and Bob Perelman’s <i>The Marginalization of Poetry</i>, Marjorie Perloff 
        wonders, “Are women language poets coming into their own just when their 
        male counterparts are flagging?  Has second-stage language poetry abandoned 
        some of the principles of its New York and San Francisco founding fathers?”  
        As she points out, such questions are not easy to answer.  See “The Coming 
        of Age of Language Poetry,” <i>Contemporary Literature</i> 38.3 (fall 
        1997): 559.  In response, I would suggest that what is changing most radically 
        is not the production but the <i>reception</i> of innovative writing.  
        While the work of women Language writers increasingly attracts attention, 
        there is a risk that critical trends of the past will simply be reversed 
        and challenging new volume by male contemporaries elided. <a href="#back41">(back
