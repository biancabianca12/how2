        Rainer’s dance piece entitled “After Many a Summer Dies the Swan” was 
        performed as a part of an evening of performance with Mikhail Baryshnikov’s 
        White Oak Dance Project at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on June 7, 9 
        10 and 11, 2000 As a dancer and choreographer working with the Judson 
        Dance Theatre [1962-1966] and then with Grand Union [1970-1972] Rainer 
        made the transition from dance to filmmaking, stating her involvement 
        with narrative as one of the major factors for this shift. In the “Profile” 
        pamphlet series interview (v.4, n.6, June 1984), done with Lyn Blumenthal, 
        Rainer said that the “conventions of cinematic narratives seemed to offer 
        more possibilities, were more interesting to me to operate both within 
        and against than were the conventions of dramatic theatrical narrative, 
        i.e., the play dialogue and monologue format. In fact, I didn't even question 
        it. There was no decision to make. I was already thinking in terms of 
        framing and voiceover” (69). </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Now, 
        seven films and almost thirty years later, she has again staged a dance 
        performance. For the purposes of this interview I chose to focus on the 
        acts or moments of repetition and return. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>WT</b>: 
        In the interview “Rainer Talking Pictures” you state that your “access 
        to film was through rationalizing my autobiography (259,<i> A Woman Who)</i>.” 
        Personal experience has provided both motivation and significant subject 
        matter for issues explored in your films —including breast cancer, lesbianism, 
        menopause, political violence and suicide. Did any of these issues again 
        return—intentionally or not—to inspire you to return to choreography after 
        thirty years of filmmaking? </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>YR</b>: 
        Last fall Mikhail Baryshnikov approached me about teaching an early dance 
        to the members of his company, the White Oak Dance Project, and, almost 
        in an aside, suggested that I might be interested in also choreographing 
        something new. Several days later he renewed his offer, now with specific 
        show dates at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. It was an offer I couldn't 
        refuse. I immediately started to think about what I might do, and began 
        to work on a weekly basis with an assistant, Pat Catterson. Pat had studied 
        with me thirty years earlier, is still dancing and choreographing, and 
        proved to be an invaluable asset in helping me retrieve material from 
        old notes and photos. It became a 35-minute dance for six people, including 
        Baryshnikov, titled “After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.” </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>WT</b>: 
        Before you made the move towards film, you were using film in some of 
        your dance performances. How did your films inform your newest choreography 
        as your dance performances informed your filmmaking thirty years ago? 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>YR</b>: 
        The organization of the materials in “Swan” bears some relation to that 
        of my early films. It seems that the polar structuring principles of narrative 
        and collage have driven my work in both film and dance. “Swan” is a collage 
        insofar as it is composed of disconnected units, some of them performed 
        simultaneously. My first film, “Lives of Performers” had a similar, though 
        sequential, structure. (Unless you split the screen, use superimposition, 
        or treat the filmic frame like a stage, it is hard to achieve simultaneity 
        in film.)</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Both 
        “Swan” and “Lives” can be characterized by fragmentation and disjuncture. 
        A section of Swan revives a solo from a group work of 1963 (also for six 
        dancers), called “Terrain.” In the original, the dancer executed a series 
        of unrelated movements connected by a static and recurrent pose of body 
        facing the audience with hands on hips, all the while reciting without 
        pause a story by the writer Spencer Holst. In the revival, Michael Lomeka 
        recites a narrative by Nabokov about the transformation of a caterpillar 
        into a butterfly while performing the same disjunctive movements. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        dance very neatly encapsulates my two interests, or should I say one interest: 
        How to have my narrative and collage at one and the same time! How to 
        simultaneously construct and deconstruct. How to create a site of contention/contradiction/distillation 
        via the body and language, a place of struggle-for-meaning.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>WT</b>: 
        I am wondering if you could talk more specifically about what sort of 
        body is operating in this piece. I am thinking of the collage of revival 
        that “Swan” is working with as well as the language of the title and the 
        two quotations that preface the dance piece in the program. It seems that 
        the body in Swan is somehow a site of conflict and exposure that is particular 
        to a certain vantage point of looking back. How are you situating this 
        body in relation to time and the space of the stage? </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>YR</b>: 
        Looked at simplistically, Swan can be construed as a meditation on aging. 
        The title, which already declares this theme, is also embodied literally 
        in the presence of Mikhail Baryshnikov — visibly older than the rest of 
        the ensemble, also separated by his celebrity — at the same time referring 
        to his classical ballet training and virtuosity. I think any use of classically 
        trained dancers that leans toward quotidian movement involves a certain 
        degree of “contention”, though this may not always be obvious. Where the 
        dancers, as in the case of White Oak, have exceptional technical range 
        (which had already been amply demonstrated in the dances preceding mine 
        on the BAM program), the “contentiousness” lies in the projections of 
        the audience, a kind of reflexive apprehension: “They're not using what 
        they have been trained to do.” At the end of the dress rehearsal at BAM, 
        I was surprised to find myself thinking aloud “There are no balances in 
        this piece.” Not entirely true, as there are many one-legged balances 
        in the Nabokov solos, but for the most part, an accurate description.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
        contention, is also implicit in other aspects of Swan: in the disjuncture 
        of its parts, in the unexpected cessation of music or abrupt changes in 
        volume of music, in the non-sequitur eruption of spoken texts, in the 
        mismatch of speech and speaker, as when a young dancer asks, “Why must 
        the culture pound out these incessant promises of infinite self-improvement 
        while so many of us are looking for ways to reckon with our inevitable 
        decline.”</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        program note—“I must constantly remind myself of the importance of mistakes, 
        failures, interruptions, breakdowns, 'inappropriate' interventions, accidents, 
        muddles, mix-ups... and chance occurrences”—is a fairly accurate description 
        of my <i>modus operandi</i> as I was putting the disparate materials together 
        (though not necessarily a description of the original creation of them). 
        I had, indeed, to keep reminding myself to avoid certain kinds of symmetries. 
        For instance, at one point I had ended the piece with everyone running 
        in a circle to the Grieg piano sonata—a mirror of the opening solo running 
        by Emmanuele Phuon. Another ending had Rosalynde LeBlanc saying, “So here 
        it is at last, the distinguished thing.” The temptation of neat intelligibility 
        accosted me at every turn. In some instances I succumbed to conventional 
        theatrical bombast, as when the pounding intro of “River Deep, Mountain 
        High” punctuates the descent of the ball in the final moment of Misha's 
        attenuated solo. I am not averse to shameless invoking of familiar effects, 
        but they must be deployed judiciously.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Which 
        brings me to the second quote in the BAM program: “I am by no means sure 
        that I should prefer a continuation of my work by others to a change in 
        the way people live which would make all these questions superfluous.” 
        Written by the philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein, it encapsulates a doubt 
        that sometimes wafts through my mind about the efficacy or value of art. 
        All these questions, all these “contentions”: If there were major “change[s] 
        in the way people live”, would art become superfluous? I think not, but 
        it still seems a worthwhile idea to entertain now and then.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>WT</b>: 
        Can you talk about this transition to dance and what this means for you 
        at this point in your artistic career to return to the medium in which 
        you began as an artist? </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>YR</b>: 
        When looking for a producer (unsuccessfully) for my last script — “MURDER 
        and murder” — I was told on several occasions that it lacked “narrative 
        drive.” From where I stood — at the end of a snail-paced twenty-year trajectory 
        that had taken me from performer to persona, from parataxicity to plot, 
        from collage to story — I had veered as far as I wanted to go in the balance 
        of this particular scale. After “MURDER and murder” I was ready to pull 
        back, start over, rethink my options. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Before 
        the White Oak offer I had been writing poetry, I also had been teaching 
        a course called “Approaches to Performance” in various institutions which 
        would culminate in a live performance consisting of fragments of material 
        contributed by the students and staged by me. The sources of materials 
        ranged from readings, film and video screenings, and writing by the students 
        in response to assignments. I had been thinking about how I might come 
        up with results similar to these “Pedagogical Vaudevilles” without the 
        arduous process of teaching. And then the White Oak opportunity came along. 
        I didn't need to rent a studio, assemble dancers, raise money, find a 
        venue, or do any of that stuff that choreographers traditionally do. I 
        found myself in a very privileged situation with ideal working conditions.

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>WT</b>: 
        You mention that you are writing poetry. In terms of your language practices, 
        where does writing poetry situate itself for you? Do you find words carry 
        any particular kind of information for you that visual images do not? 
        Are you exploring similar narrative and collage issues on the page space 
        that you have with your other work?</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>YR</b>: 
        Last year I wrote about thirty poems. So far this year I have not written 
        one. My dances often combined language with body activities. In filmmaking, 
        language superceded the body. Poetry offered a site of pure contemplation, 
        with no necessity for the mediating gaze of an audience. I have had no 
        urge to publish my poems (although several are included in “After Many 
        a Summer Dies the Swan”). The act of being in the moment with language 
        — forget the tsurras of characters, mis-en-scene, bodies, actors, crew, 
        fund-raising, technological apparatus, film festivals, production values 
        — provided an all too sufficient pleasure. The poems are mostly short, 
        everyday, non-rhyming but rhythmic. The one that ends Swan is not uncharacteristic:</font></p>

        Although you frame the act of writing poetry as a process that is decidedly 
        different from that of choreographing dances and making films, do you 
        see your language practices with poetry as performative? Do you consider 
        your poetry functioning within a choreographic format, one that is, in 
        fact, playing with an apparatus, in a specific interaction between words, 
        the page, space and the body?</font></p>

        at all. That is what is so liberating about it. As for “a specific interaction 
        between words, the page space and the body,” I would say there is an implicit 
        interaction in that words denote, are never far from physicality, and 
        the rhythms of poetry, though originating in imagined vocalization, are 
        always delineated spatially on the page.</span></font></p>

        Yvonne Rainer was born in San Francisco in 1934 and has lived in New York 
        City since 1956. As a dancer and choreographer, she was one of the founders 
        of the Judson Dance Theater in 1962, the genesis of a movement that proved 
        to be a vital force in modern dance in the following decades. In 1972, 
        Rainer completed her first feature-length film and has in all written, 
        produced and directed seven features. She is the recipient of numerous 
        awards and fellowships as well as four Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts Degrees. 
        Five books dealing with her work have been published, most recently, <i>A 
        Woman Who…:Essays, Interviews, Scripts</i> (John Hopkins University Press, 
        1999) In June of 2000 Rainer returned to dance with the 35 minute &quot;After
