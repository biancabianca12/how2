      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Anne Waldman&#146;s book-length poem <i>IOVIS</i> 
        I (1993) confronts masculine energy as a determining force of myth, history 
        and culture, a force embodied in the male but also sparking through the 
        female, specifically, the author herself. As 336 pages of collage-epic, 
        <i>IOVIS I</i> inflects the legacy of the modernist long-poem with a feminist 
        perspective and formal strategy influenced by H.D. An homage to H.D.&#146;s 
        <i>Trilogy</i> and to <i>Helen in Egypt</i> registers in Waldman&#146;s 
        prophetic voice, use of language and myth, and compositional structuring. 
        Waldman also acknowledges her debt to other collage-epic masters, including 
        Pound, Williams, Zukofsky, and Olson. These gestures signal not only the 
        multiple threads of modernist influence in <i>IOVIS</i>, but also Waldman&#146;s 
        desire to weave a her own mantle within the matrix of contemporary epic 
        revisionists. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Composed between 1985 and 1992, <i>IOVIS I </i>pulsates 
        with profusion and multiplicity on levels linguistic, historic, mythic, 
        dramatic, prosodic, and formal, while putting wit, argument, and self-inquiry 
        into play. Its twenty-three sections offer a kinetic juxtaposition of 
        various forms--poetry, prose, letters, non-English fragments, dreams, 
        lists, chants, and interview texts choreographed visually on the page 
        within the larger frame of epic motifs: struggle, travel, and transformation. 
        Summoning male figures from myth and history, Waldman invokes the voices 
        of male deities, ancestors, lovers, family, friends, artists, poets, and 
        correspondents. She herself is the shifting bard, adopting a range of 
        personae: goddess, monster, mother, lover, daughter, teacher, warrior 
        and boy. She journeys through locales exotic and quotidian, actual and 
        virtual on a mission to critique the excesses of masculine aggression--not 
        only in men but in herself&#150;as it manifests in the world&#146;s pernicious 
        streams of violence, destruction, and oppression. No male basher, however, 
        she also celebrates the &quot;skillful means&quot; of masculine passion 
        and intelligence. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The title <i>IOVIS</i> can be loosely translated from 
        the Latin to mean &quot;all is full of Jove,&quot; or Jupiter, patriarch 
        of the gods and Roman counterpart to the Greek Zeus. In 1997, a second 
        book,<i> IOVIS II</i>, focusing on feminine energy, appeared, and a third 
        volume is in progress. In examining male energy in herself, Waldman honors 
        her paternal ancestry and male literary mentors. She considers Charles 
        Olson&#146;s 1965 marathon reading in Berkeley, for example, to be her 
        moment of confirmation as a young poet. </font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
        the call to poetry occurred during her girlhood in her parents&#146; Greenwich 
        Village apartment. &quot;Charged&quot; with language, she fell in love 
        with poetry as a kind of &quot;secret code&quot; for her own experience, 
        and vowed to pursue this &quot;glorious art&quot; (<i>Contemporary Authors 
        Autobiography, </i>273). As she tells it, Waldman&#146;s account of her 
        birth as a poet assumes an aura of myth. It recalls H. Adz&#146;s penchant 
        for Greek and Egyptian myth as a mask yet also a legitimizing frame for 
        her own poetic development and gender consciousness. In the following 
        reminiscence, Waldman, noting her curiosity about female &quot;rites of 
        passage&quot; and envying the freedom of male poets, alludes to Greek 
        myth and to the Egyptian myth of Isis, who steals the secret word from 
        the sun god in order to empower herself: </font></p>

      </table>
     
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the spirit of H. D., Waldman alludes to myth to 
        authorize her quest for poetic identity and legitimacy, first as a woman 
        and later as an innovator. During a 1964 archeological trip to Greece 
        while she was a college student, she read and cataloged the seals on amphora 
        handles. As talismanic signs of epic adventure, the phallic amphora handles 
        written in secret codes signaled the powerful presence of a male trace 
        as well as the mysterious absence of the female, suggested by the lost 
        vessels themselves. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As Waldman grew more interested in women writers, 
        including H.D., Stein, Dickinson, and Riding, Waldman was intrigued by 
        the &quot;breakdown of semantics, grammar, derangement, or deconstruction 
        of solid narrative mind-sets and tight-jawed preconceptions about writing. 
        These issues seemed close to my own concerns, my own mental grammar and 
        experience&quot; (273). This interest in experimental poetics intersects 
        with her oppositional politics and long-time study of myth and spirituality 
        in <i>IOVIS I</i>&#146;s critique of the &#145;heroic&#146; as a notion 
        still welded to violence.<i> </i>The poem issues a cry of rage and despair 
        at the war and weapons culture that continues to prevail in male-dominated 
        culture more than fifty years after H. D.&#146;s <i>Trilogy.</i> </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Through appropriation and multilingual pastiche--strategies 
        demonstrating her search for a &quot;new language&quot;--Waldman begins 
        to undo the binary, dualistic notions that cast male and female into constant 
        opposition. A form of literary cross-dressing, the poem speaks many tongues 
        and spirals through vast expanses of time and space until gender is unfixed 
        and shifts or floats in various positionings of male and female energies. 
        In the epigraph which begins this essay, for example, Waldman spins Virgil&#146;s 
        opening line of the Aeneid (&quot;Arms and the man I sing&quot;) with 
        irony and feminist bravado absent in H. D.&#146;s own anguished reference 
        to the same line. Yet both poets respond to the reckoning with epic masters 
        and, crucially, to the alienation from the masculinization of epic tradition 
        that any woman poet working in long forms must confront. Be it from a 
        mask of despair or bravado, H. D. and Waldman are issuing an epic challenge 
        to themselves. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Both poets take up the challenge through an inquiry 
        of language itself. H. D. makes a gendered interrogation of words in her 
        anti-war masterpiece, <i>Trilogy, </i>that stages the redemption of words 
        associated negatively with feminine energy; for instance, she rejuvenates 
        &quot;Venus,&quot; a culturally despised icon of &quot;venery,&quot; redeeming 
        its meaning as &quot;veneration.&quot; Waldman makes various playful, 
        curious, and satirical etymological slides, as in the following lines: 
        &quot;valor, valve, avail / walthan, waldan, wealdan, / <i>wieldan</i>: 
        to govern / <i>wald</i>: power, rule / <i>Waldr</i>: ruler / (staying 
        up late studying myself) / what&#146;s in a name?&#133;&amp; out of what 
        / words / to enter a womb / to patrimony?&quot; (<i>IOVIS I</i>, 135-6). 
        Here the inquiry into language through juxtaposition of divergent tongues, 
        registers, and dictions implies a critique of the symbolic realm as it 
        represents patriarchal poetry, and as irruptions by a woman innovator 
        disturbs that rigid tradition. This project also extends Gertrude Stein&#146;s 
        insistence on recapturing &quot;the value of the individual word, [to] 
        find out what it meant, and act within it.&quot; H. D. and Waldman also 
        employ non-English idioms as talismanic discourse. Codes, hieroglyphs, 
        and foreign expressions subvert the authority of patriarchal language 
        and redeem other languages in the effort to open these systems as well. 
        <i>IOVIS</i> includes protest letters, chants, and prayers for political 
        change. However, the poem achieves its most effective &quot;revolution 
        in poetic language,&quot; to use Julia Kristeva&#146;s phrase, by introducing 
        &quot;through the symbolic that which works on, moves through, and threatens 
        it&quot; (81). </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Reinforcing <i>IOVIS</i> as a poem of epic scope, 
        Waldman draws on material from the Indo-European, ancient Egyptian, and 
        Native American traditions as well as Buddhist, Christian, and Hindu faiths. 
        Besides conferring the bardic voice with epic authority, this encyclopedic 
        embrace of cultural materials also confirms the powerful female presence 
        in history and myth, a lost and suppressed tradition which H. D.&#146;s 
        <i>Trilogy</i> took important steps to recover. Waldman&#146;s use of 
        at least fifteen foreign languages, from the ancient Babylonian to modern 
        Balinese, Spanish to Sanskrit, also enhances <i>IOVIS</i>&#146;s epic 
        and cultural authority, recalling, of course, Pound&#146;s and Eliot&#146;s 
        similar strategies in The<i> Cantos</i> and <i>The Waste Land</i>. Yet 
        Waldman&#146;s bard seems a postmodern sister to H.D.&#146;s modernist 
        one, wandering through multicultural shards to forge new meanings in a 
        world now more influenced by women&#146;s participation than in H.D.&#146;s 
        time, but still dehumanized by war, violence, and technology. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">H.D.&#146;s recovery of erased female myth and power 
        in <i>Trilogy</i> proposes a cure for modernist ills&#150;war, destruction, 
        loss of faith&#150;through poetry itself and the promise of the blank 
        book in which a future, including the full participation of women, will 
        be written. Similarly, Waldman adopts a prophetic, bardic voice in <i>IOVIS</i> 
        to protect &quot;the language flame, the tribe&#146;s demand for land, 
        now dream-land,&quot; because the only remaining frontier is spiritual 
        or internal. In difficult contemporary times of &quot;disinheritance, 
        betrayal, loss of power,&quot; the cure proposed by Waldman is &quot;salvation-poetry&quot; 
        (<i>IOVIS II</i>, 9). This phrase makes the modernist implication, usually 
        absent in work considered postmodern (as this work is), that poetry has 
        redemptive value as a spiritual or cultural force. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As H.D.&#146;s persona of the despairing poet transfigures 
        in <i>Trilogy</i> from lowly worm to Psyche-butterfly, she gains strength 
        through reclaiming suppressed female myth as the missing piece in patriarchal 
        history; she enacts &quot;the flowering of the rod,&quot; transforming 
        the symbolic, phallic caduceus with the female image of the flower. Her 
        subversive transformation of gender symbols is reenacted in moves made 
        as Waldman moves to realign gender energies. To Waldman, it&#146;s no 
        accident that a nuclear submarine coolant leak should summon up the connection 
        between military power and sublimated sexual drive; this atomic, erotic, 
        and poetic heat becomes a formula for abuse of power. <i>IOVIS</i>&#146;s 
        exposure of connections between realms that the symbolic order prefers 
        to keep separate clarifies Waldman&#146;s feminist perspective on body 
        poetics and the body politic. The practice of power as experienced personally 
        bespeaks its inscription in the larger culture, a system Waldman would 
        open as she does herself.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Her solution, reminiscent of H.D.&#146;s flowering 
        rod, emerges with the imaginative construction of sister-brother siblings, 
        each of whom must &quot;light the mind&quot; in order to transmute through 
        language the landscape of pain. They stand side by side as a bigendered 
        construct of imagination, less an androgynous amalgam than a rebalanced 
        version of male-female yin and yang. Sibling agency suggests the inward 
        reconciliation of male and female energy within the poet herself, as well 
        as the possibility of a new model of male-female relations in the outside 
        world. The image arises from an awareness also clear in <i>Trilogy</i>: 
        The poet can only change herself. Instead of conjuring an &quot;other&quot; 
        abstraction outside of herself, she proposes her own transfiguration as 
        a hope for that of others. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">H.D.&#146;s later long poem, <i>Helen in Egypt</i> 
        offers its spirit of theater, use of myth, and long form to enact sexual 
        and emotional difficulties, the poet&#146;s sense of wisdom and loss. 
        In <i>IOVIS</i> Waldman encodes autobiographical materials as mythic theater. 
        <i>Helen in Egypt </i>also has a structuring device that Waldman appropriates 
        in <i>IOVIS</i> to add coherence to her disjunctive text. H. D. begins 
        each section of <i>Helen</i> with an italicized, anecdotal summary that 
        acts as a narrative and voice frame. As each section of <i>IOVIS</i> begins, 
        a straightforward narrative paragraph provides an introduction and narrative 
        commentary. The headnotes, in effect, offer context, resonance or perspective 
        as well as the consistent voice of a reliable narrator. This voice intensifies 
        the work&#146;s performative energy, in effect doubling of the bardic 
        voice within the poems themselves.</font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Waldman&#146;s 
        bigendered twins can be discerned early in her epic invocation of the 
        muse, which seems to include both male and female energies, as does H. 
        D.&#146;s muse in <i>Helen</i>. Waldman first inscribes her muse in relation 
        to her sense of female &quot;destiny of yes o yes.&quot; But then a &quot;he&quot; 
        is added; he is identified, however, only through negation in a long list 
        of particular &quot;types&quot; of men. Here is a portion of Waldman&#146;s 
        muse passage:</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The invoking and negating of stereotypes, in effect, 
        rejects narrow definitions that would reduce the fullness of male humanity 
        to a social or occupational role. Through a reversal of terms that traditionally 
        have reduced woman to her socially proscribed role constructs and erased 
        or silenced her full humanity, Waldman refuses to perpetuate such terms. 
        This strategy resists capturing the &#145;he&#146; that would bring him 
        under her control, avoiding objectification consistent with the muse tradition. 
        She may also be wary of adopting a male muse who himself may still wish 
        to be a poet and to control her as a poet (DuPlessis 23). A woman poet 
        who simply reverses gender terms runs the risk of perpetuating her own 
        thralldom. This is part of the problematic attempt to take control of 
        her own story that is central to any woman writer&#146;s struggle because, 
        as Rachel Blau DuPlessis has pointed out, &quot;the culture into which 
        she is about to step, in which she wants to participate, is the site at 
        which she is negated&quot; (26). Central to this struggle is the question 
        of permission and access to the terms of her vocation, of which both Waldman 
        and H. D. are painfully aware (see essay epigraphs). &quot;How then can 
        a woman act who will be a writer? What will give her birth? What will 
        nourish her&quot; (27)? </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Waldman&#146;s &quot;destiny of yes&quot; is that 
        energy which fuels her agency in consort with the irreducible &quot;he.&quot; 
        This evocation of the muse calls up &quot;twin&quot; forms of desire toward 
        which <i>IOVIS</i> moves through the tribulations of love and the struggle 
        to extend her authority as woman poet. To enter and close the gap between 
        terms is to grow and transform. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It may be said that Waldman&#146;s muse extends the 
        &quot;multiple family muse&quot; model of H. D.&#146;s in <i>Helen in 
        Egypt, </i>as proposed by DuPlessis. A &quot;sustaining system&quot; of 
        family may be reimagined by the woman poet who, in her struggle to write, 
        needs to overcome woundings or fixations by renegotiating a system to 
        sustain her. H. D. names a mother, father, brother, sister, and child; 
        the figure of Helen is &quot;a composite of all these&quot; (<i>Helen</i> 
        187). Waldman&#146;s figures differ, but the multiple frame applies as 
        she comes to terms through reordering &quot;family, sexes, psyche&quot; 
        (DuPlessis 39). Waldman examines the masculine energy in herself with 
        the hope of reordering it beyond her, first through her son, <i>IOVIS&#146;s</i> 
        lively boy, the shape-shifting trickster, young poet and story writer, 
        mother&#146;s companion and boy-spirit with whom she feels most comfortable, 
        most attuned. The poem&#146;s hope, perhaps, is for an even wider spiral 
        of healing.</font></p>
