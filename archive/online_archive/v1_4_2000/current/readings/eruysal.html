      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">During the 
        London Blitz, H.D. found herself in a city which corresponded to the chaotic 
        world described by Hans Jonas in his book about Gnostic religion, a "world 
        of darkness, utterly full of evil,...full of devouring fire ... a world 
        of darkness without light ... a world of death without eternal life and 
        a world in which the good things perish and plans come to naught." (57) 
        In her books, H.D. borrowed images from a variety of heretical discourses 
        with roots in ancient Gnostic teachings. She melted these images in the 
        alchemical vessel in which base metals are transformed into gold. She 
        aimed at transforming herself mentally and her <i>labor Sophiae &#150; 
        </i>"an alchemical encounter with the unconscious" as Jung put it in <i>Alchemical 
        Studies</i>" (171) &#150; was an attempt to resuscitate the alchemical 
        axiom: &quot;Transform yourselves from dead stones into living philosophical 
        stones!" In order to make the transition possible, the poet required images 
        in which inner meanings could be deciphered via transformation.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In his lecture 
        on Nietzsche&#146;s <i>Zarathustra</i>, Jung talked about how he discovered 
        a passage in the 16th century Hermetic text in which the philosopher makes 
        an interesting statement: "For those who have the symbol, the passing 
        from one side to the other, the transmutation is easier. (In habentibus 
        symbolum facilior est transitus)&quot; (1248). Jung went on to speculate 
        on this statement and reached the conclusion that "This is the condition 
        by which any man in any time can make a transition: with the symbol he 
        can transmute himself ... It's the system or the symbolic formula to apply 
        when the soul is in danger" (1249). In wartime London H.D. felt that the 
        soul was in jeopardy and she sought to revivify it by delving deep into 
        her personal unconscious laden with images and ultimately returning with 
        a Jungian "union of opposites," or, in other words the final reunion of 
        anima and animus as a pair of opposite archetypes. As a syncretist, she 
        borrowed her images from ancient religions in which she discovered a central 
        theme: the exile of the goddess from the realm of God and her final reunion 
        with Him. Albert Gelpi, in his introduction to H.D.'s "Notes on Thought 
        and Vision," wrote that H.D. and Jung could have reached a better understanding. 
        I also think H.D. and Jung had a similar perspective. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Echoing 
        H.D.'s announcement in "Notes on Thought and Vision" that "today there 
        are many wand bearers but few inspired," Jung, in <i>Symbols of Transformation</i>, 
        claimed that only the poet could understand the origin of words which 
        have a healing power. As he put it: "It's as if the poet could still sense, 
        beneath the words of contemporary speech and in the images that crowd 
        in upon his imagination, the ghostly presence of bygone spiritual worlds, 
        and possessed the capacity to make them come alive again" (30). In &quot;Notes 
        on Thought and Vision,&quot; H.D. emphasized this mission of the poet 
        and stated that "the minds of men differ but the overminds are alike" 
        (12). In other words, the personal unconscious differs but the collective 
        unconscious is shared by all of us and the poet has the power to excavate 
        these buried images. H.D. found these images in three heretical discourses: 
        Gnosticism, Kabbalah and Alchemy.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> In Gnosticism, 
        she found Sophia, the feminine counterpart of God who is sent into exile, 
        since he cannot bear his own feminine side. Only Christ can liberate Sophia 
        after fusing the masculine and feminine aspects of his self. In the Kabbalah, 
        the most striking idea is the dualism in the godhead which comprises both 
        masculine and feminine aspects. The Shekhinah is a feminine dimension 
        of God which he disowns. Therefore, the Gnostic symbol of Wisdom, Sophia, 
        and the Shekhinah have certain features in common. Both of them are anima 
        figures, companions of a God animus who sends them into diaspora. The 
        human psyche is God's bride. Adam's violation of the unity between God 
        and His bride makes the Shekhinah fall. When God and the Shekhinah unite, 
        all dualities will disappear. One of the symbols which the alchemists 
        used at different stages of the alchemical operations is Luna (The Moon 
        is also the Shekhinah) whose spiritual marriage to Sol is intended to 
        help cease the masculine and feminine duality. They are also, alternatively, 
        personified as King and Queen, Rex and Regina, Sulphur and Mercury. Their 
        union is a symbol for the transformation of man into a higher being or 
        a living stone. These are the figures that H.D used in order to constitute 
        the central theme of her poetry: the separation and the final reunion 
        of masculine and feminine forces in one's nature.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the opening 
        lines of &quot;The Walls Do Not Fall,&quot; the first part of <i>Trilogy</i>, 
        one can feel the dissolution of profane time. Mircea Eliade describes 
        this process as a projection into "mythical time <i>in illo tempore</i> 
        when the foundation of the world occurred. Thus the reality and the enduringness 
        of a construction are assured not only by the transformation of profane 
        space into a transcendent space (the center), but also by the transformation 
        of concrete time into mythical time" (20). This transformation dominates 
        the whole poem. The image of the temple stands for the discontinuance 
        of concrete time. In the opening lines, the shrine lies open to the sky 
        and is transformed into what Eliade calls an "axis mundi." The ruin and 
        the tomb are images that appear in the <i>Rosarium Pictures</i>, twenty 
        woodcut illustrations depicting the alchemical process. The rain, or alchemical 
        <i>aqua permanens </i>(water of life), falls upon the shrine and the poet 
        finds herself on the verge of a religious transformation or an individuation 
        process (in Jungian terms). Like the Gnostic alien, the poet or the soul 
        ascends, transcending the barriers erected by the archons, the rulers 
        of the world. The road is full of dangers, but the poet is strong as she 
        can decipher the meaning of archetypes and the hidden patterns of her 
        own unconscious, as well as the collective unconscious of her age. The 
        sliced wall represents the gate opening unto the unconscious where there 
        are otherwise no walls, no doors. Seeking to discover the "inner hall 
        or cellar to Mary" H.D. passes on to another sliced wall "where poor utensils 
        show / like rare objects in a museum"(510). In the Old Testament, the 
        Fourth Book of Moses Commonly Called Numbers (4:7), I came across a similar 
        description of the Presence and the utensils. The Presence advises Aaron 
        and Moses to take away the ashes and lay a purple cover on the altar and 
        asks them to put on it all the utensils. The words of the Lord and H.D.'s 
        description of the utensils also resurrect the Gnostic "Hymn of the Pearl,&quot; 
        Moses, Aaron and the Prince in quest for the pearl accompany H.D. &quot;in 
        a dream parallel.&quot; H.D.'s dream &quot;merges the distant future with 
        most distant antiquity&quot; (526). </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like the 
        Wisdom Sophia of the Shekhinah, the poet wants to go back home which is 
        a beautiful place where the grasshopper says &quot;Amen.&quot; In the 
        Kabbalistic philosophy the grasshopper is a symbol of God worship. Besides 
        the grasshopper, the fish appears as a symbol for the Lapis-Christos parallel. 
        In alchemistic literature, the two fishes in the sea are Soul and Spirit. 
        Soul is the inward individual spirit; Spirit is the universal soul in 
        all men. Their endeavor to come together will end in a wedding ceremony 
        or the <i>mysterium coniunctionis</i> of alchemy. H.D. defines this marriage 
        as a clash of opposites and uses Osiris and Isis as archetypal figures 
        whose marriage stands for the clash between the masculine and feminine 
        forces in nature. The answer to H.D.'s question at the end of &quot;The 
        Walls Do Not Fall&quot; is nothing less than the union of opposites: &quot;O 
        sire,/ is this union / at last?&quot; (542).</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;Tribute 
        to the Angels&quot; opens with the declaration of Hermes Trismegistus 
        as the patron of alchemists. The angels Azrael, Raphael, Gabriel, and 
        Uriel are gathered in the domain of poetry and in the imagination of the 
        poet. The line &quot;the levelled wall is purple as with purple spread 
        upon an altar&quot; (551) takes us back to the beginning of &quot;The 
        Walls Do Not Fall,&quot; when the emergence of the Presence brings to 
        mind a scene in the Old Testament where Aaron and Moses lay a purple cover 
        on the altar. The color signifies an important stage in the process of 
        reaching the <i>magnum opus,</i> the Great Work of the alchemists. Although 
        the Lord has declared that they shall not look upon the holy things, the 
        poet does enter the divine realm and she wonders "how is it that we dare 
        / approach the high-altar?"(558). She melts the words and reaches Mary, 
        the mother of the philosopher's stone. H.D. asks: &quot;what is this mother-father 
        / to tear at our entrails ? / what is this unsatisfied duality / which 
        you cannot satisfy?&quot; (522). </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At the end 
        of the alchemical operation, the jewel is attained; the poet passes through 
        fire and enters a shrine where she finds the eternal image of the female 
        awaiting her. She asks herself: &quot;was it the may-tree or apple&quot; 
        (558). Gershom Scholem interprets the apple tree as a Zoharic symbol which 
        stands for the Shekhinah. After the King and Queen are united, a tree 
        appears and the united eternal body is resurrected. This is the final 
        stage of the reintegration process called Tikkun in Kabbalistic symbolism. 
        It is this resurrection which H.D witnesses: &quot;This is the flowering 
        of the rod / This is the flowering of the wood&quot;(561). The Lady or 
        the apple-tree appears while the poet is waiting for Gabriel or The Moon 
        regent. The Lady/ Shekhinah / Wisdom Sophia / Regina comes because she 
        is the Moon in the process of Chymical Marriage, yet she looks different. 
        She is as white as snow denoting the final stage of the alchemical process. 
        She is God's widow, called Malcuth. The book she is carrying is white 
        like the white pages of the authentic Torah. Scholem writes of this Torah: 
        &quot;In the time of the Messiah the letters of this &#145;white Torah&#146; 
        will be revealed" (174).</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;The 
        Flowering of the Rod&quot; represents the last stage of reintegration 
        of the dual forces in one's nature. The poet and Hermes leave cities behind 
        and &quot;mount higher to love-resurrection&quot; (578). The poet leaves 
        the earth and sets out on a return journey like the geese of the arctic 
        circle. Her destination is the region of love, that is, Eros. The poet 
        declares that she is not responsible for the barrenness of the earth. 
        She cries: &quot;pitiless, pitiless, let us leave / The place of a skull 
        / to those who have fashioned it&quot; (579). H.D. is drawing on a very 
        familiar story in these lines, that is the crucifixion, yet she changes 
        the story radically and relates the story so that Mary Magdalene and Christ 
        are trying to escape from the cemetery. In <i>Mysterium Coniunctionis,</i> 
        Jung interprets this escape as follows: &quot;The word &#145;escape&#146; 
        presupposes a state of imprisonment which is brought to an end by the 
        union of opposites&quot; (65).</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the poem, 
        there is a flashback to the encounter between Mary Magdalene and Kaspar 
        who has something that he cannot sell. He says this thing is for a double 
        ceremony, both funeral and coronation. I interpret his words from an alchemical 
        perspective and see that the double ceremony is exactly the<i> mysterium 
        coniunctionis</i> which emerges in the form of two images: the tomb and 
        the coronation which appear in the final picture of the <i>Rosarium Pictures</i>. 
        There, Mary identifies herself with the Anatolian goddess Kybele and the 
        mother of Attis and anoints Christ's head. In his book <i>Bloodline of 
        the Holy Grail: The Hidden Lineage of Jesus Revealed</i>, Lawrence Gardner 
        claims that the anointing ceremony is a wedding ritual. The bride is Mary 
        Magdalene and the bridegroom is Christ. Kaspar reveals this suppressed 
        fact and frees his own feminine side (Jungian anima) after he rediscovers 
        the Eternal Feminine. In the final lines of the poem Kaspar is accompanied 
        by Balthasar and Melchior. His gift is symbolic and the Eternal Feminine 
        speaks: &quot;he did not know whether she knew / the fragrance came from 
        the bundle of myrrh / she held in her arms&quot; (612). </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In <i>The 
        Gospel of the Gnostics </i>by Duncan Greenlees, I've come across a scene 
        in a Gnostic hymn called &quot;Wisdom&#146;s Wedding Song,&quot; which 
        bears a striking resemblance to the emergence of the Eternal Feminine. 
        A shrine is described where a bride is about to meet her bridegroom&quot; 
        &quot;Her bridechamber is brightly lit / breathing an odour of balsam 
        and spice / And giving out sweet scent of myrrh and foliage / while myrtle 
        branches are spread within&quot; (262). The self-chosen exile of the Shekhinah 
        / Sophia comes to end at this point.</font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After 
        creating several different manifestations of the Eternal Feminine in <i>Trilogy</i>, 
        H.D. wrote <i>Helen in Egypt</i>, where she revived the legendary figure 
        of Helen. The composite figure Helen / Hell / Hel or Hilda, the Germanic 
        Goddess of the Underworld knows underworld images and lets H.D. discover 
        the image of the mother in the course of her own individuation process. 
        H.D. recreates this image in the form of the legendary figure of Helen. 
        Jung describes this process of moulding as follows: "The unconscious yearning 
        of the artist reaches back to the primordial image in the unconscious 
        which is best-fitted to compensate the inadequacy and onesidedness of 
        the present. The artist seizes on the image, and in raising from deepest 
        unconscious he brings it into relation with conscious values, thereby 
        transforming it until it can be accepted by the minds of his contemporaries 
        according to their powers" (83). Helen (Selene/ Moon) is an image of the 
        fallen soul like Sophia and the Shekhinah and has a lunar origin. Helen's 
        words echo Sophia Prunikos' lamentations when she admits: &quot;I'm a 
        woman of pleasure&quot; (12). Helen and Achilles ( Sophia and God / the 
        Shekhinah and God / Regina and Rex) undergo a process of reconciliation 
        of opposites in the self. Achilles is wounded and needs Helen to complete 
        his being which suffers from anima-possession and Helen needs his cooperation 
        in order to cut off the bonds repressing Eros. Troy is the place of the 
        skull like Golgotha. Helen and Achilles try to escape. Their escape brings 
        to mind Mary and Christ's escape from the place of skulls. After their 
        marriage and the birth of their child, Helen witnesses the flowering of 
        the pomegranate and she remembers that she has to return to the underworld, 
        yet the apple trees (the Shekhinah) also bloom. Leuke is as white as the 
        moon and Helen feels that &quot;the wheel is still.&quot; The birth of 
        the child / <i>lapis philosophorum</i> (the philosopher's stone) finishes 
        the cycle of transformation reintegrating the opposing forces in Helen's 
        / Hilda's self. Thus H.D. unites the opposites in her self and reaches 
        <i>Matrepater</i>, a union of Mother and Father as they exist together 
        in Moravian hymns.</font></p>
