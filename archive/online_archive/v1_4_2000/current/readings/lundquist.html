      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Barbara 
        Guest doesn&#146;t want to be called a postmodernist. She thinks of contemporary 
        poets instead as an extending into the latter half of the twentieth century 
        many of the experiments of international modernism. In an 1992 interview 
        she claimed, with some asperity: &quot;Poets are taking the modern tradition 
        further. I don&#146;t like that term &#145;postmodern.&#146; I think it&#146;s 
        a cheap idea. There&#146;s no such thing as postmodernism; you&#146;re 
        either modern or you&#146;re not. &#145;Postmodern&#146;! that sounds 
        like some sort of advertising clich&eacute;&quot; (Hillringhouse interview 
        26). Guest&#146;s work conveys a &quot;sense of Modernism,&quot; as Robert 
        Kaufman has phrased it: &quot;not as style or canonized authority but 
        as continued experiment, as critical-exploratory approach to the given 
        (12). She herself recently confirmed her sense of the ongoingness of modernism, 
        musing that although in the beginning she experienced a certain &quot;difficulty 
        entering modernity,&quot; she &quot;also had, instinctively, a need to 
        do this...[it was] where I wished to be. From there I reached out on my 
        own and came to my own conclusions, which changed drastically from year 
        to year, and I find that this is exactly what the poem does itself. It 
        goes from place to place trying to find an identity. It goes anywhere 
        it wants to go&quot; (Remarks 124). To Guest, modernism still offers a 
        rich and active range of options to the contemporary poem in search of 
        identity. &quot;I grew up in the febrility of modernism,&quot; she said 
        in an interview. &quot;I love constructivism and cubism, all those isms...the 
        white on white painting and the emptiness of a canvas. The ideas of space 
        in modernism&quot; (qtd in Rabinowitz 3). One might add imagism and surrealism 
        to these, and also as Anna Rabinowitz does, &quot;abstract expressionism 
        and minimalism&quot; (3). </font> 
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Also, 
        Guest&#146;s engagement with the individual artists who made modernism 
        is stunningly deep, wide, various and personal. So many artists in an 
        array of media enter her work as live allusive presences, as stylistic 
        and thematic resources, as &quot;others&quot; to whom her imagination 
        strongly responds: from Schoenberg (she is avid for what she calls his 
        &quot;stringency&quot;) to Stein, from Strindberg to Picasso and Dora 
        Maar, and including Matisse (loving his deep understanding of the color 
        black), and Mir&oacute; (with grateful recognition of his wartime celebration 
        of a &quot;poetess&quot; figure). Her poetry is in dialogue with Kandinsky, 
        Joyce, Stevens, Hans Arp, Pierre Reverdy, Theodor Adorno. Brenda Hillman 
        notes how gleefully in &quot;Handbook of Surfing&quot; Guest teases Pound 
        and Eliot, and pays &quot;genuine homage to Stein&#146;s poker-faced playfulness&quot; 
        (208). She mourned the death of her friend Robert Motherwell, partly for 
        his loss to modernism. &quot;He was the holdout for modernism in painting,&quot; 
        she claimed. &quot;He really explained it, loved it, and was its knight&quot;(Hillringhouse 
        interview 26). </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Perhaps, 
        however, with no modern artist did Guest so entangle her mind and heart, 
        her imagination, her consciousness, her waking working hours and her dream 
        time, than with the modernist poet H. D. In 1984, after five years of 
        travel and research, Guest published her biography of the poet, becoming 
        (somewhat to her surprise) one of the initiators of a spectacular re-investigation 
        and reclamation of H.D.&#146;s life and work. She worked, she wrote afterward 
        &quot;during the antediluvian stage of H.D. scholarship;&quot; she was 
        the very first to delve into the Beinecke archive of letters, which were 
        &quot;before my time, unheard from, unseen, slumbering unread,&quot; and 
        then &quot;given into my sole safekeeping&quot; (&quot;Intimacy&quot; 
        60). She didn&#146;t particularly want to produce, she wrote in her initial 
        proposal to the publisher, a formal or particularly scholarly biography: 
        &quot;I am a poet and a novelist and I can write only from such a vantage 
        and perspective. I'd want to evoke an atmosphere; I do want to bring this 
        life into focus; I do want to hint, to disturb, to caution, to define. 
        I wish to create a portrait of this distinguished, albeit difficult women, 
        in the draperies of her era&quot; (Guest papers). Since that time, as 
        we know, there has been a veritable explosion of critical scholarship, 
        written from an entire spectrum of theoretical perspectives, most of them 
        bolstered by feminist theory, on this woman who was Ezra Pound&#146;s 
        paradigmatic <i>imagiste</i>, Sigmund Freud&#146;s analysand, the woman 
        who translated or transposed or &quot;refabricated&quot; (in the case 
        of the Sapphic fragments) much ancient Greek poetry, who wrote experimental 
        prose fiction, essays, and memoirs which have been described as &quot;vibrant 
        cultural readings of her various selves interwoven with her times&quot; 
        (Friedman, DuPlessis xi), who wrote poetic chronicles of the violence 
        and waste of two world wars, who labored to restore to classical western 
        mythology its lost matriarchal substance. </font>
      <p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I&#146;d 
        like to ask some simple questions related to the fact that the woman writing 
        the biography of a poet is a poet herself, especially since musings about 
        the relationship between &quot;bio&quot;&#150;the life, and &quot;graphy&quot;&#150;the 
        writing, appear motif-like everywhere in Guest&#146;s own body of poetry. 
        Since these are questions of intimacy and influence, they don&#146;t stay 
        simple very long; they grow enormous and begin to seem questions central 
        to so many areas of critical and theoretical investigation: the question 
        of female &quot;anxiety of influence,&quot; the links and breaks between 
        modern and contemporary poetry, the interaction of biographer and subject, 
        the extent and the character of H.D.&#146;s poetic legacy, and, my particular 
        area of interest: a viable and detailed description of Guest&#146;s achievement 
        in poetry. Did Guest, by writing her life, gain H.D. as a poetic &quot;foremother&quot;? 
        What did Guest steal or borrow from H.D. stylistically and thematically? 
        What were their vital connections and similarities, their vital divergences 
        and distinctions? Did Guest <i>like</i> H.D.? Did she admire her work; 
        did she <i>want </i>her influence, did she find a way to render it usable, 
        to engage H.D. in a dialogue or a dispute? Did she take heart from her 
        example, her struggles and triumphs? Did H.D. help her to know herself 
        as a &quot;woman poet&quot; as well as a New York poet, identified with 
        that otherwise all male group of innovators including John Ashbery, Frank 
        O&#146;Hara, and James Schuyler?</font> 
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Pertinent 
        to this matter are three central documents, besides the biography itself, 
        which is titled <i>Herself Defined: the Poet H.D. and Her World</i>. One 
        is a chapbook poem in nine sections, <i>Biography</i>, published in 1980, 
        four years before the book, therefore written during the period when Guest 
        was deeply immersed in her research and writing (sunk in it, imprisoned 
        by it, harried and oppressed, and &quot;hag-ridden&quot; by it, her letters 
        sometimes complain). The others are prose essays, written after the publication 
        of <i>Herself Defined</i>: &quot;The Intimacy of Biography&quot; in 1984, 
        and &quot;H.D. and the Conflict of Imagism&quot; in 1996. The first of 
        these essays reflects very candidly on the experience of positing oneself 
        as a biographer. Guest describes her recurrent reluctance to mythologize 
        her subject, to make of her a feminist hero, and her constant recognition, 
        at once reassuring and dismaying, that H.D., like all of us, was &quot;not 
        exactly a goddess, or even always a heroine, but...a human being who was 
        rooted also deeply in what is known as &#145;the little life,&#146; that 
        of clothes, money, meals, family, love affairs&quot; (&quot;Intimacy&quot; 
        59). (One is reminded of Virginia Woolf&#146;s defense of the &quot;little&quot; 
        lives of feminine domestic artistry). </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Guest 
        remembers a feeling of the presence at her back in those days, of women 
        readers and writers hungry for foremothers of stature, as this series 
        of edgy questions makes clear: Is the task of the biographer &quot;to 
        be the selector of elements significant and fabulous upon which ancestor-worship 
        is based[?]...Is the biographer one who leads these people to the sacred 
        shrine? Does the biography provide a role-model for aspiring modern women 
        who believe that a dead but immortal author holds the key to the mystery 
        of life, and is this biographer expected to allow them a closer view of 
        the sources of creativity?...was I expected to lead the chosen...to the 
        pantheon?&quot; Guest herself partly wants these things&#150;&quot;I desired, 
        I say this now somewhat sadly,&quot; she writes, &quot;everything,&quot; 
        the &quot;flames of the sources of creativity,&quot; <i>and</i> the &quot;pattern 
        and texture of lives simply as lives&quot; (&quot;Intimacy&quot; 59). 
        But she seems throughout more in search, not of an &quot;ancestress to 
        worship,&quot; but for the humble and therefore inimitable spectacle of 
        a real, recoverable, historical woman true to her desk, adamant about 
        her working hours, determined to produce, with sweat and determination, 
        her own poetry. </font>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Whenever 
        Guest speaks or writes about H.D., she is usually very circumspect, purposely 
        inarticulate about how or even if the form and content of her work owes 
        H.D. a poetic debt. (This is in sharp contrast to very detailed and appreciative 
        statements made about H.D. by Guest&#146;s contemporaries, Denise Levertov 
        and Robert Duncan). When asked about a possible debt, she has several 
        times instead confessed her sense of H.D.&#146;s stylistic inimitability, 
        a critical assessment which is at once a generous tribute to H.D.&#146;s 
        achievement and (I suspect) an elegantly phrased skepticism about its 
        immediate or ultimate effect on her own verse. In the introduction to 
        <i>Herself Defined</i>, she writes, in the very first sentence, of being 
        &quot;converted to Imagism,&quot; by H.D., &quot;tempt[ed] to feeble, 
        complimentary imitations,&quot; at which &quot;I was never successful. 
        No one ever has been&quot; (ix).</font></p>
      <p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        an 1978 radio interview with Susan Howe, she said: [H.D. is] &quot;one 
        of the few women that one can select, that one can learn something from, 
        although no one has really written the way she has. Too difficult to do. 
        I remember I tried it once a long time ago and I couldn&#146;t possibly 
        do it. It&#146;s so condensed and so polished and the vocabulary&#146;s 
        so restricted....you notice her vocabulary, she keeps extremely sparse, 
        that&#146;s why she&#146;s so good, and why she&#146;s difficult to imitate. 
        There are very few words. And...for her space is made up of a stone a 
        flower a shell, that&#146;s about it... a wave, maybe. &quot; In the 1992 
        interview for <i>American Poetry Review</i>, she is more direct and very 
        careful to distinguish H.D.&#146;s influence on the poetry from the effect 
        on her working procedures and on her senses of dedication and professionalism. 
        Mark Hillringhouse asked if H.D. was a strong influence on her poetry. 
        Guest answers: &quot;I was immediately attracted to that poetry. But I 
        absolutely was unable to imitate her. She is inimitable, although the 
        form appears so simple.&quot; And asked if H.D. were not a mentor at all, 
        she claims: </font>

              wasn&#146;t when I first began writing. I didn&#146;t think of her

              I learned a lot from her, not from her poetry. I learned from her 
              life and I learned from the people she associated with and from 
              their work..... I learned how to work hard and how to be selfish. 
              She was one of the most selfish people you could encounter&#150;a 
              poet. I learned to keep writing. It made me very strict. (Hillringhouse

      </table>
      <p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Again, Guest 
        reveals her need at once to praise H.D. and to deny that she was able 
        to access in any significant way H.D.&#146;s particular poetic skills. 
        And again, this reads to me something like a protective closing of her 
        own work to interpretation based on H.D.&#146;s example, and a preemptive 
        warning off of readers (like myself and Hillringhouse) who might want 
        to make something more linguistically substantive that she would of her 
        long involvement with the older poet. One thinks of the automatic critical 
        pairing made of Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, based partly on their 
        close friendship, but probably also on their both being women poets, despite 
        considerable differences in their work. Guest may, for her own reasons, 
        have preferred not to have her influences explained primarily in terms 
        of gender. And she may not have been quite happy or comfortable with the 
        implied mother/daughter relational configuration, so seemingly apt given 
        their respective birth dates (1886, 1920; Perdita Schaffner, H.D.&#146;s 
        actual daughter, was born in 1919, making her Guest&#146;s almost exact 
        contemporary, indeed Schaffner and Guest shared an apartment in New York 
        City for a time). </font>
      <p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She 
        likes instead to posit herself, and even her earliest poetry bears her 
        out in this, as a fully realized, fully adult practitioner of her craft, 
        and as a poet in charge of her own themes and subjects. Brenda Hillman&#146;s 
        observation that Guest &quot;remind[s] us in the variety of styles and 
        patterns that, for her, modernism and postmodernism are siblings, not 
        parent and child&quot; (209) is pertinent here. Also, in claiming repeatedly 
        that H.D. is inimitable, I think that she is claiming that she <i>hasn&#146;t</i> 
        imitated her, that she hasn&#146;t needed or wanted to, that her poetic 
        concerns were other, stranger, her own and of her own place and time. 
        Guest wrote of James Schuyler in terms that are also self-descriptive: 
        &quot;It is unnecessary for him to borrow or appropriate, and he never 
        does. He merely owns&quot; (&quot;Vuillard&quot; 15). Just as Guest is 
        not Mir&oacute;&#146;s or Balla&#146;s or Schoenberg&#146;s or Stein&#146;s 
        daughter or apprentice, she would not like to be seen, wrongly in her 
        opinion, as H.D.&#146;s, solely on the basis of her interest and long 
        immersion in H.D.&#146;s <i>life</i>. </font>
      <p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
        have learned <i>to be selfish</i>, nonetheless, no woman writer would 
        deny is an invaluable inheritance; H.D. was for Guest an unapologetic 
        model of a woman claiming and making for her work the time and space it 
        required, pushing away, when it required lovers, husband, child, friends. 
        Barbara Guest: &quot;. . . a person quite close to H.D. told me that she 
        was the most selfish person he had ever known. I decided to practice my 
        own brand of selfishness....A hearty selfishness is needed to complete 
        as much work as H.D. had undertaken....Distance can denote concentration, 
        not necessarily always a self-centered retreat into the ephemeral&quot; 
        (&quot;Intimacy&quot; 61). </font>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Surely 
        Guest also, as a lifelong innovative writer, constantly reinventing her 
        style, implacably going her own way, eluding definition and appropriation, 
        must have taken to heart H.D.&#146;s stern self-directed commands to write, 
        to say things heretofore unnamed in one&#146;s own voice, even if writing 
        felt like reinventing the wheel, and even if it only resulted in being 
        misunderstood and having to wait years for one&#146;s audience. Guest 
        wrote of H. D. that she &quot;could never have become a member of an &#145;establishment,&#146; 
        literary or otherwise. And she preferred it that way. She wanted to be 
        left alone to weave her private web&quot; (&quot;Intimacy 69). She might 
        have written the same thing, I suspect, about herself.</font>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Guest has 
        intently chronicled other aspects of her biographic entanglement with 
        H.D. She wrote, for instance, that she was at times in a &quot;state of 
        grace,&quot; while doing biography. The work had a kind of forward propulsion 
        of its own that was gratifying to tap into daily and which made it, in 
        retrospect, seem &quot;easier&quot; than writing poetry. She experienced 
        a feeling of greediness for &quot;the vast mystery that was the life of 
        H.D.,&quot; and developed a taste for detective work. She writes thankfully 
        of having made invaluable friends on both sides of the Atlantic. She was 
        euphoric during the first year but later exhausted and haunted: &quot;I 
        woke up one night and saw H.D. standing at the foot of my bed....Another 
        night in a dream I heard Bryher say, &quot;Beware the Jester.&quot; This, 
        like &quot;an obedient Freudian,&quot; Guest interpreted to mean that 
        Bryher was warning her that she would probably not find or portray any 
        objective, &quot;real&quot; H.D., but only manage to &quot;Guest-her&quot; 
        a liability of the biographer&#146;s art that Guest took humorously and 
        seriously to heart (&quot;Intimacy&quot; 62). </font></p>

        also spoke and wrote about the energy and time the biography required 
        and indicated that with immersion in H.D.&#146;s &quot;mental weather&quot; 
        and wildly fluctuating &quot;private barometer&quot; she risked drowning 
        her sense of self, her private aesthetic, perhaps even her mental equilibrium 
        and sense of humor. &quot;I have to write some of my own poetry,&quot; 
        she confessed to a sympathetic Susan Howe, &quot;in order to keep my head 
        up above the water.&quot; In &quot;Shifting Persona&quot; Guest wrote 
        knowingly and sympathetically about Picasso&#146;s relationship to <i>his</i> 
        predecessor, how it became more personal and psychological than artistic: 
        &quot;Picasso went into the Vel&agrave;squez painting very far. Yet his 
        enormous struggle, which involved his wife and friends, took place far 
        less within the realm of Art than in the psychological struggle of an 
        artist to survive the atmosphere of an originating persona. We are also 
        aware of Picasso's need to endow Vel&agrave;squez with the Picasso persona&quot; 
        (86). </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In poetry 
        Guest could always entertain her modernist colleagues on her own terms 
        under her own powerful and capacious aesthetic umbrella; she could engage 
        them deeply and irreverently in dialogues in which she is clearly a conversational 
        equal. So many of her poems are examples of this wonderful hospitality: 
        Mir&oacute; in &quot;The Poetess,&quot; the futurist Giacomo Balla in 
        &quot;The Farewell Stairway,&quot; Gertrude Stein and Juan Gris in &quot;Roses,&quot; 
        the sculptor Tony Smith in &quot;Egypt&quot; and in <i>The Countess from 
        Minneapolis</i>, Picasso in &quot;Dora Maar,&quot; Schoenberg who is the 
        hovering dissonant inspiration of much of <i>Defensive Rapture</i>, Robert 
        Motherwell in &quot;All Elegies are Black and White.&quot;) But the biography 
        was fundamentally different, somehow overwhelming her loner&#146;s instinct 
        and preference for engaging others on and about artistic terms, with the 
        very different exigencies of a huge, detailed, bygone, messy life which 
        was, in any case, ultimately irrecoverable in a satisfying way: &quot;I 
        have learned,&quot; she wrote, &quot;through a process of grievous enterprise 
        that although the biography is published, the poet&#146;s private chamber 
        remains securely fastened&quot; (&quot;Intimacy&quot; 70). Indeed, the 
        poet Marjorie Welish described Guest&#146;s prolonged extra-poetry task 
        as her &quot;long and arduous bout with biography,&quot; (215) as if biography 
        were a lingering disease or a wrestling match. So she poured her exhilaration 
        and her despair, her admiration and her loathing, her uncertainties and 
        her occasional bursts of triumph into the self-saving poem <i>Biography</i>, 
        which was saving to no small degree because it <i>was</i> poetry. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;<i>Biography</i> 
        is a very complex poem, an astute, if elusive, poetic rendering of the 
        mental, emotional, psychological, even moral and aesthetic state of the 
        poet who finds herself treading the &quot;dubious route&quot; of biography, 
        caught in the dilemma of living someone else&#146;s life while living 
        her own. It reflects on the meaning and the dangers, attractions, and 
        sheer weirdness of otherness, of giving one&#146;s life and consciousness 
        over to a dead woman. In the prose poetry quotation at the head of this 
        essay, from section four, the repeated phrase &quot;hers and mine,&quot; 
        is crucial in its plastic and telling ambiguity. Indeed the whole quotation, 
        the whole of section four, the whole poem could be discussed as expansions 
        on the immensely fraught meaning of the word &quot;and&quot; as it sits 
        between &quot;hers&quot; and &quot;mine.&quot; &quot;Idiosyncrasies&quot; 
        and &quot;chairs,&quot;&#150;these things, which can stand, synecdochically 
        for all things, solid physical object, and traits of personality and behavior 
        (concrete and abstract nouns), are &quot;hers <i>and</i> mine&quot; (my 
        emphasis). They are things the two of them hold in common, things they 
        own mutually, equally. On the other hand, the phrase allows an alternate 
        reading: these idiosyncrasies are mine and those are hers; these chairs 
        are mine and those are hers, divided as clearly as in a divorce settlement.</font></p>
      <p><p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;What 
        kind of couple <i>are</i> we? the poet seems to ask over and over. How 
        can I find you? How can I escape you? How can I avoid being wrong about 
        you? What is yours and what is mine? How can I assert about you what I 
        intuitively understand but cannot footnote? How can I reassemble a whole 
        vanished world? How did I, who so love suggestion and metaphor get stuck 
        in the stodgy literalness of <i>this</i>? Why should I trade my vital, 
        warm-blooded existence for your insubstantial and shadowy world? How strange 
        you are and alien; how intimate and familiar. How do I, so resolutely 
        reticent about my own life, justify and satisfy this &quot;itch,&quot; 
        this &quot;urge / really to &#145;know&#146;&quot; about the smallest 
        details of yours? How can I assert my original self in this pervasive 
        &quot;atmosphere of an originating persona&quot;? </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;This 
        is a crude paraphrase, much removed from Guest&#146;s distinctive flavor 
        and disjunctive style, of the suggestive imagism of <i>Biography</i>, 
        which is so deft and rich in its use of objects, weather, atmospheres, 
        intricate and endless verbal nuance and implication, always such a feast 
        for explication, always enticing the reader into her idiosyncratic vision.

        passage opens itself somewhat to a reader&#146;s assumption that it is 
        about (in the peculiar way Guest&#146;s poems are &quot;about&quot; anything) 
        the experience of writing a biography about H.D. Here is a tentative explication: 
        the biographer&#150;the &quot;I&quot; of the poem, has been searching 
        for a reason or explanation for an emotional scene of some sort in the 
        life of H.D.&#150;&quot;caterwauling / on the stair&quot; -- now lost 
        to time, but perhaps partially alluded to in one of her research sources. 
        She has found the reason and yet not found it useful or complicated enough: 
        the &quot;stair&quot; led to a &quot;chamber [that] was empty.&quot; Was 
        the reason too &quot;simple&quot; for biographical interest, a scholarly 
        <i>cul-de-sac</i>? Was it too intangible, made up of too-many-parts intuition 
        and too-few-parts documentable proof? And yet, the biographer&#146;s route 
        is laid out, inexorably: &quot;it went up, and I went on,&quot; a &quot;view&quot; 
        became visible, which &quot;made up for the [difficult, uncertain] journeying&quot; 
        to attain it. </font></p>

        she retains a certain poet&#146;s grumpiness concerning the stubborn &quot;reality&quot; 
        of the biographer&#146;s materials: &quot;I don&#146;t enjoy real lakes&quot;&#150;perhaps, 
        to paraphrase Marianne Moore, she would prefer lakes of her own imagination 
        with real fish in them to the various European lakes that H.D. knew, and 
        resided near, and that now Guest must acquaint herself with in all their 
        undeniable geographical and physical reality.1 Also there&#146;s always 
        something lurking in the depths, something always only partly describable, 
        something creepy or frightening at the corner of the consciousness, just 
        as one is beginning to investigate some beautiful graceful creature gliding 
        above the surface&#150;&quot;the swans.&quot; And then, is it incumbent 
        on the scrupulous biographer, having come across a reference to Galuppi 
        (1706 - 1784, the Italian composer whose comic operas won him the title 
        &quot;father of the opera buffa&quot;) to investigate, to listen, to learn? 
        How might Galuppi turn out to have resonance in the life of H.D.? The 
        name vibrates comically and absurdly in the poem, as it might at the back 
        of a harried biographer&#146;s mind. &quot;All those real people!&quot; 
        Guest exclaimed, chagrined and amused at her own chagrin. &quot;Life. 
        Not made-up invented life. Real life&quot; (&quot;Intimacy&quot; 64). 
        </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9; It 
        is typical of Guest to use journey metaphors to describe experience, and 
        she invents some of her oddest, most opaque and dream-like to render the 
        mysterious strangeness of her years of fellow-travelling with H.D. <i>Herself 
        Defined</i> added much at the time it was written to the then burgeoning 
        knowledge base of information about H.D, and is therefore an important 
        and useful book. It assumes the historian&#146;s mantle of authority: 
        &quot;finally, after several years,&quot; Guest writes, &quot;I permitted 
        myself to acknowledge that I had become a biographer. I knew too many 
        secrets of the court not to be given that title&quot; (&quot;Intimacy&quot; 
        59). But <i>Biography</i> stimulates differently and endlessly, avowing 
        its own bewitching awkwardness, doubt, and vulnerability, and yet resplendently 
        asserting its author&#146;s right to her <i>poetic</i>, rather than historic, 
        knowledge and vision. It preserves, in shimmeringly condensed language, 
        vast auras of elusive truth, extraneous to the biography-proper, which 
        might otherwise have evaporated. In a phrase that could admirably describe 
        so many of Guest&#146;s poetic investigations into literature, aesthetic 
        theory, and the work of individual artists, Kaufman writes that Part III 
        of <i>Rocks on a Platter</i> (1999) makes &quot;braided suggestions of 
        an irreducible mixture between lived and literary history&quot; (16). 
        <i>Biography</i> attests to the high cost of that &quot;braided&quot; 
        irreducibility as it was achieved in this particular mixture of life and 
        literary history, this poet&#146;s bout with the past and with the &quot;other.&quot;

        ways parentheses are meaningful in general, they are meaningful in surrounding 
        the word biography here. That biography is endemic and crucial to all 
        art is both a digression from the main point about that art, and a qualification 
        and an amplification of the main point about that art. This amounts in 
        fact to a performance of one of Guest&#146;s central paradoxes: that she 
        could insist that &quot;all poetry is confessional,&quot; and yet be resolutely 
        evasive about her own life. No matter how intricately wrought, no matter 
        how delicate or colorful, even if touched as lightly as with a &quot;faerie 
        glove,&quot; a poem will betray its writer&#146;s biography. Does writing 
        explicit biography further &quot;betray&quot; the art devised to conceal 
        or minimize it? The parentheses placed around &quot;biography,&quot; shows 
        both Guest&#146;s own desire for secrecy, and her awareness that it is 
        futile. (Things in parentheses pretend to be digressive or beside the 
        point; often they seem instead framed and highlighted). The fact that 
        biography in Guest&#146;s work operates always under this kind of erasure 
        and/or emphasis adds curious dimension to her decision to write another 
        poet&#146;s biography. </font></p>
       
         
           
             
               
                 
                  
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
        to return to the question of poetic, as opposed to biographic entanglement, 
        it is true that their divergences (stylistically, tonally, even thematically) 
        are quite considerable. Guest wants a wider vocabulary than H.D.&#146;s 
        though she marveled at what H.D. achieved within that self-imposed restriction; 
        she is more than content with verbal irony where H.D. reaches for social 
        and cosmic irony; she can be blithe or elliptical or comical where H.D. 
        is solemn, strident, fervent; H.D.&#146;s poem will have identifiable 
        subjects or themes, while Guest plays toward her subject and is more likely 
        to trust aleatoric twists and discoveries. Yet, I do think more <u>can</u> 
        be made of coincidences between the poetic modes and strategies of the 
        two women than Guest has wanted to make herself. I would like to call 
        these &quot;coincidences&quot; rather than matters of influence, as it 
        is very hard to disentangle what has been learned, from what is innately 
        held in common, temperamentally and aesthetically. Three areas of convergence 
        readily suggest themselves: imagism, belief in beauty and mystery, and 
        an interest in things Greek. Guest&#146;s work, as Welish points out, 
        &quot;exemplifies the poetic adage that beauty is difficult. Here it is 
        painstaking&quot; (215). Barbara Einzig&#146;s description of Guest&#146;s 
        ways with Greek art and culture show her affinity for their fragmentation, 
        as opposed to H.D.&#146;s reclamation and restoration: &quot;Charon, Hecate, 
        Jove, Odysseus, Cyclops, Leander cross over into the text, but they usually 
        swim back, shy of a classical story, spearing instead as shards of their 
        original narratives, clues, fragments of the mythologies of another time&quot; 
        (7). I will conclude this paper by discussing how imagism connects these 
        two poets&#146; sometimes widely different aesthetics. </font>
      <p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Guest, 
        like almost every poet of the twentieth century, has deep roots in imagism; 
        it is a legacy and an allegiance she has never thought to deny. When she 
        declared to Charles Bernstein that she was not a pragmatist, he replied 
        that he wouldn&#146;t ask her what she <i>was</i>, since she didn&#146;t 
        &quot;have to be anything,&quot; granting her an artist&#146;s dearly-held 
        right not to declare a label or affiliation. Yet, her immediate rejoinder 
        was: &quot;No, I&#146;m an old-fashioned, I guess you could say an imagist, 
        how&#146;s that?&quot; and went on to define imagism thus: &quot;It used 
        to mean using an image to replace the idea. But I think now, I would like 
        a few ideas to enter in also, sideways, next to the imagination.&quot; 
        To add conditions to the &quot;few don&#146;t&#146;s&quot; of imagism 
        has been, of course, the prerogative of the truest Imagists beginning 
        with Pound himself. </font>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Assisting 
        H.D. to break out of the imprisoning role, as it came to seem to her, 
        of reigning and then forgotten <i>imagiste par excellence,</i> has been 
        the necessary agenda of H.D. readers and critics for twenty-five years. 
        But for Barbara Guest, it is exactly the perfected and fearless wielding 
        of imagism&#146;s ultra-condensed sensory vividness that intermittently 
        shines out as a characteristic of her own unique brand of experimental 
        poetry. &quot;Guest went unerringly to the one quality in H.D. which set 
        her apart, the quality of the surface,&quot; writes Dale Going. &quot;For 
        most poets, the work of H.D. has spelled exclusivity, the influence has 
        been toward what should <i>not</i> happen; for Guest, it pointed the way 
        to a new richness: it had not to do with specific form, but with conviction 
        finally stripped of restraint&quot;(13). </font>
      <p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Rarely 
        has a writer trusted so recklessly in the communicative power of things 
        seen; she manages to outdo H.D. at imagistic <i>presence</i> void of stated 
        rhetorical &quot;meaning.&quot; Indeed, she can be so stringent in her 
        imagist&#146;s refusal to explain or provide connectives that her poetry 
        can appear at first glance incomprehensible, willful, solipsistic perhaps 
        in its writerly refusals. &quot;The &quot;foreignness of the image...exerts 
        a fascination to which the poem is willing to submit,&quot; she writes,&quot; 
        &quot;but not always the reader. The reader is apt to say, &#145;oh, another 
        image,&#146; or &#145;oh another picture&#146;&quot; (&quot;Conflict&quot; 
        17)</font>
      <p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
        say that ideas enter her poems &quot;sideways, next to the imagination,&quot; 
        describes rather accurately their disorienting, ravishing, ambiguous presence 
        there, sorting strangely and on equal terms with images, never superceding 
        them. Along with surrealism and linguistic fragmentation, imagism is one 
        of the deep wells of modernist experimentation that Guest finds far from 
        exhausted, and which she herself renews constantly in surprising ways. 
        Rarely does she write an entirely imagist poem or limit herself to its 
        strictures, but imagism, with its reliance on the thing intensely <i>seen</i>, 
        is an irreducible element of all her poetry. Here is an example from &quot;Nebraska&quot; 
        (1973), of how imagism, in one of its late twentieth century permutations, 
        lends itself to the humming, multifaceted texture of a Guest poem: </font>

        her characteristic disjunctive poetics with its surrealist influences, 
        its tonal variety, its lively and playful surfaces, bright and sumptuous 
        images, nouns, natural creatures and objects, Guest packs her four dense 
        stanzas to their very edges, without a trace of ordering punctuation, 
        as if Nebraska offered to the eye a seamless array of things and happenings 
        to be seen, a view constantly changing, growing: &quot;a leaf arches through 
        its yellow / syllable, &quot;delicate / smoke&quot;; &quot;each leaf has 
        a shadow.../ with its pine and cone its seedling,&quot; &quot;the ashy 
        retrograding slopes,&quot; &quot;the swift nodding,&quot; &quot;sunlight 
        and wisely found rocks,&quot; &quot;bird droppings / where the staircase 
        ended that was only roof. &quot; This mysterious landscape that others 
        have found plain or empty or monotonous is portrayed instead as anything 
        but empty. The space the poem creates in admiration of Nebraska&#146;s 
        space is richly dense, yet open, resonant, sonorous, brimful, and charged. 
        In H.D.&#146;s handsel modernist work, <i>Sea Garden</i>, published 57 
        years earlier, Guest had access to a commanding and impressive use of 
        this skill in imparting almost hallucinatory vividness by way of language 
        to landscape. She must have recognized a sister virtuoso; one whose excitement 
        at the meaningfulness of the natural world provoked a similar linguistic 
        agitation and discipline, a similar inventiveness in imagism, a similar 
        expansion of imagism and out of it. &quot;For her kind,&quot; wrote Robert 
        Duncan, &quot;H.D.&#146;s tone presented a key in which to live.&quot; 
        For all her protective resistance to H.D.&#146;s outsized biographical 
        presence in her life, Guest&#146;s work attests to the fact that she was 
        &quot;her kind,&quot; and that she has written, often and splendidly in 
        H.D.&#146;s stimulating emotional and poetic &quot;key.&quot; </font>

        glaciers,&quot; one of the protagonists of &quot;Twilight Polka Dots&quot; 
        is itself a murmurous lake with its own agenda: &quot;the lake dwelt on
