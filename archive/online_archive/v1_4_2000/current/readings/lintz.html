        Eliot reviewed the Hogarth Press edition of Gertrude Stein&#146;s <i>Composition 
        as Explanation</i> in January 1927, he blasted Stein as &quot;ominous,&quot; 
        someone who is &quot;going to make trouble for us,&quot; and &quot;of 
        the barbarians.&quot; What exactly did Eliot see in Stein&#146;s writing 
        that led him to perceive her as such a threat to modern literature?<a href="#note1"><b><kbd>1</kbd></b></a> 
        <a name="back1"></a>One element of the answer can be explored by comparing 
        the use of repetition in Stein&#146;s writing with a figure one perhaps 
        would not expect, the seventeenth century British Reverend Lancelot Andrewes. 
        In his 1926 essay &quot;For Lancelot Andrewes,&quot; Eliot extols the 
        literary merits of Andrewes&#146;s sermons, focusing in particular on 
        the relationship between repetition and memory: &quot;In this extraordinary 
        prose, which appears to repeat, to stand still, but is nevertheless proceeding 
        in the most deliberate and orderly manner, there are often flashing phrases 
        which never desert the memory&quot; <a href="#note2"><b><kbd>2</kbd></b></a> 
        <a name="back2"></a>(FLA, 22). In stressing the relationship between repetition 
        and movement forward, Eliot&#146;s description of Andrewes sounds remarkably 
        similar to how one might describe Stein&#146;s own style.<b> </b>Indeed, 
        several poets who were Eliot&#146;s contemporaries did just that. Writing 
        in 1926, the same year as Eliot&#146;s essay on Andrewes, Marianne Moore 
        judged that in Stein&#146;s writing, &quot;Repeating has value then as 
        a &#145;way to wisdom.&#146;&quot;<kbd><b><a href="#note3">3</a></b></kbd> 
        <a name="back3"></a>Four years later, William Carlos Williams would refer 
        to Stein&#146;s &quot;very apparent repetitiousness&quot; as &quot;the 
        final clue to her meaning.&quot;<kbd><b><a href="#note4">4</a></b></kbd>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
        is it in Andrewes&#146;s use of repetition that sets him apart from Stein? 
        Two selections from Andrewes&#146;s sermons which Eliot cites as exemplary 
        cases of repetition shed light on their differences. Eliot thought enough 
        of the first to (mis)cite it in &quot;Gerontion&quot;: </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        this line, Andrewes uses the classical trope of <i>antanaclasis</i>, repeating 
        a word while subtly bending its meaning away from the previous signification. 
        Here Andrewes shifts between several different meanings of the noun &quot;word.&quot; 
        Since Andrewes originally preached this line as part of his 1618 Nativity 
        Sermon before James I, one can infer that his use of &quot;word&quot; 
        refers to the problem of the <i>Verbum</i><u> </u><i>infans</i>, the question 
        facing Mary and Joseph of what to name the baby Jesus, expressed more 
        clearly in Andrewes&#146;s original phrasing &quot;the Word without a 
        word.&quot;<kbd><b><a href="#note5">5</a></b></kbd> <a name="back5"></a>Yet 
        the spatial paradox of Eliot&#146;s adapted &quot;The word within a word&quot; 
        suggests other possible meanings, evoking the classical idea that each 
        word is composed of both a sound component and a semantic component, what 
        the Stoics called the <i>signans</i> and <i>signatum</i> of the <i>signum</i>, 
        and Saussure the signifier and signified of the linguistic sign. As the 
        sound component is necessarily external by virtue of its material audibility, 
        &quot;word within a word&quot; would seem to point to the internal, hidden 
        &quot;meaning&quot; within the sign. &quot;Unable to speak a word,&quot; 
        however, shifts the signification again to the sense of &quot;word&quot; 
        as articulated sound&#150;the Stoic <i>signans</i> or Saussurian signifier. 
        In Andrewes&#146;s skillful hands, antanaclastic repetition is no game, 
        but rather serves the serious purpose of reminding the members of the 
        church, and especially the king, that mortal language can never encompass 
        the true spiritual meaning of the divine <i>logos</i>. Repetition is the 
        only literary trope available to Andrewes capable even of approaching 
        the unspeakability of the holy word.</font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
        yet if T.S. Eliot admired Lancelot Andrewes&#146;s use of antanaclastic 
        repetition to the point of including it in his own poetry, then why could 
        he not stomach its use by Gertrude Stein? An example from &quot;Sitwell 
        Edith Sitwell,&quot; one of Stein&#146;s portraits printed along with 
        the lecture &quot;Composition as Explanation&quot; in the volume Eliot 
        reviewed, offers a revealing comparison with Andrewes. Her title&#146;s 
        shift from the imperative to the proper noun sense of &quot;Sitwell&quot; 
        sets the mirthful tone of Stein&#146;s text, where she plays with antanaclasis 
        throughout. The following line is a typically exuberant example: </font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like Andrewes, 
        Stein repeats a noun multiple times within her sentence. But the meaning 
        of Stein&#146;s &quot;table&quot; does not necessarily bend in exactly 
        the same manner as Andrewes&#146;s &quot;word.&quot; Stein&#146;s antanaclastic 
        repetition has a distinctly grammatical orientation. In her repetitions 
        of the noun &quot;table,&quot; she makes no attempt to explore different 
        significations of &quot;table&quot; as a noun; her verbal play does not 
        take place at the level of the signified.<b> </b>Stein&#146;s table is 
        just that, a table. Her writing explores the range of grammatical uses 
        possible for the morpheme &quot;t-a-b-l-e.&quot; In this sentence, for 
        example, Stein places &quot;table&quot; alternately in the position of 
        subject (&quot;Table table to be,&quot;) verb (&quot;to table,&quot;) 
        and predicate (&quot;to see table&quot;). Table serves as the object of 
        a preposition (&quot;to table&quot;); as the object of a verb (&quot;to 
        see table&quot;); and as the object of a personal pronoun (&quot;table 
        to me&quot;). It is only these grammatical combinations which suggest 
        alternate significations in different contexts, such as a child&#146;s 
        birthday wish (&quot;Table table to be&quot;) or the movement of a social 
        butterfly at a dinner party (&quot;table to table to table&quot;). </font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
        Stein&#146;s portrait utilizes that Andrewes&#146;s sermon does not is 
        sound as a device to throw the signifying chain forward. In this sentence, 
        she lets rhyme prompt her next move, as &quot;to be&quot; leads to &quot;to 
        see&quot; and &quot;to me.&quot; Homonymic punning also prompts the reader 
        to hear meanings not dictated by denotation or convention, as &quot;table&quot; 
        easily slides into &quot;to be able,&quot; with &quot;table to be&quot; 
        hinting at the wishful &quot;to be able to be.&quot; If Andrewes repeats 
        to the point where he is &quot;unable to speak a word&quot; to show the 
        impossibility of language to ever be commensurate with the mysteries of 
        faith, then Stein repeats in order to reveal the heuristic pleasure of 
        wordplay. The greatest joys in her writing are discovering new possibilities 
        for how words can create meaning. Stein&#146;s play turns antanaclasis 
        into <i>paronomasia</i>, uncovering unnoticed links between sound and 
        meaning. Her repetition works in the spirit of Puttenham&#146;s elegant 
        definition of the Latin trope of <i>repetitio</i>: &quot;When we make 
        one word begin . . . and lead the dance to many verses in suit.&quot;<kbd><b><a href="#note7">7</a></b></kbd> 
        <a name="back7"></a>Steinian repetition explores the phonic pleasures 
        of the signifier, not the spiritual gravity of the signified. </font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
        how is this different from what Eliot commends in Andrewes&#146;s use 
        of language? A different repetitive device Eliot highlights in Andrewes 
        helps illustrate the difference:</font></p>

              us then make this so accepted a time in itself twice acceptable 
              by our accepting, which He will acceptably take at our hands.</font>

        </tr>
      </table>
      
      
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Here 
        Andrewes plays off the permutations of the verb &quot;to accept,&quot; 
        moving from its participial adjective (&quot;accepted&quot;) to its verbal 
        adjective (&quot;acceptable&quot;) to its verbal substantive (&quot;accepting&quot;) 
        to its adverb (&quot;acceptably&quot;). Andrewes comes as close as a writer 
        in an uninflected language like English can come to <i>polyptoton</i>, 
        the Greek trope of repeating a word in different cases or inflections 
        for poetic effect. Yet Andrewes uses the repetitive force of polyptoton 
        not to impress aesthetically but to persuade. He plays on &quot;accept&quot; 
        only within the teleological framework of a hortative subjunctive clause, 
        established by the sentence&#146;s opening &quot;Let us then make...&quot; 
        Because Andrewes&#146;s polyptoton is firmly subordinated to his sentence&#146;s 
        hortatory push, it does not function as play but as a means to reinforce 
        meaning, in this instance to convince his listener to accept divine grace. 
        And what does Eliot admire in Andrewes&#146;s writing but that &quot;he 
        will not hesitate to hammer, to inflect, even to play upon a word for 
        the sake of driving home its meaning&quot;? (FLA, 23)<b> </b>Eliot&#146;s 
        very insistence on the possibility of &quot;driving home&quot; a word&#146;s 
        meaning implies that each linguistic sign possesses a univocal identity, 
        one immutable signification which the writer reveals. Linguistic play, 
        figurative language, rhetoric, matter only to the extent that they add 
        force to meaning. </font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Stein&#146;s 
        writing does not establish the same hierarchy of meaning over play.<b> 
        </b>A series from &quot;The fifteenth of November&quot; shows how she 
        uses polyptoton differently from Andrewes:</font></p>

            <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Played

            </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        playing with variations of the verb &quot;to play,&quot; Stein jumps from 
        past perfect to present conjugated form, then continues by sliding assonantly 
        from &quot;plays&quot; to &quot;says&quot; to &quot;access.&quot; Present 
        and past perfect are reversed in the second sentence, leading to the shared 
        sibilant endings of &quot;access&quot; and &quot;impress.&quot; Stein 
        works with language not as an ideal but as an actuality. Language is something 
        with which we play; we have access to it; we may impress; we may acquiesce; 
        we may make mistakes. Is this all that her sentence says, however? Is 
        it just a phonic game? While sound is one factor connecting Stein&#146;s 
        verbs, it does not overrule signification. Thinking of the context in 
        which Stein wrote &quot;The fifteenth of November,&quot; this passage 
        could refer to Stein the writer who plays with language, gains access 
        to an important editor, impresses him, gets him to acquiesce and publish 
        her, and then feels that she has made a mistake. Or was it he who made 
        the mistake? The passage could also have a darker undertone of sexual 
        violence, as a person who plays, gives someone else access, and acquiesces 
        sexually, can realize later that they have made a mistake. Stein&#146;s 
        exploration of phonetic interplay does not reject that language has meaning, 
        but rather challenges the possibility of ever being able to &quot;drive 
        home&quot; one univocal meaning. Repetition shows the impossibility of 
        ever achieving perfect linguistic closure, no matter how skillfully the 
        rhetorician may hammer at it.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In trying 
        to understand what T.S. Eliot looked for in a writer at the time he reviewed 
        Gertrude Stein in January 1927, his 1926 essay on Lancelot Andrewes is 
        one invaluable piece of evidence. A second, and the clearest illustration 
        of how Eliot saw his own writing at this moment, is his January 1927 <i>Enemy</i> 
        response to a review of his own poetry, I.A. Richards&#146;s reading of 
        &quot;The Waste Land&quot; in his &quot;A Background to Contemporary Poetry&quot; 
        article. Richards complimented Eliot on what he considered to be the &quot;two 
        considerable services for this generation&quot; Eliot offers in &quot;The 
        Waste Land.&quot; The first was Eliot&#146;s unique ability to capture 
        &quot;a perfect emotive description&quot; of the modern state of mind 
        after science has neutralized our natural emotional responses, the moment, 
        in Richards&#146;s metaphor, when our &quot;thirst for the life-giving 
        water . . . seems suddenly to have failed.&quot;<a href="#note8"><b><kbd>8</kbd></b></a><a name="back8"></a> 
        To Richards, &quot;The Waste Land&quot; alone among poems spoke to the 
        desiccated, dissociated state of modern feeling. </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While 
        Eliot was honored by Richards&#146;s praise, he strongly protested its 
        logic, for Richards credited Eliot&#146;s power to match description and 
        emotion to a &quot;complete severance between his poetry and <i>all</i> 
        beliefs.&quot; Though he agreed with Richards&#146;s diagnosis of the 
        threats to poetic sensibility in the modern world, Eliot did not accept 
        that conscious dissociation of poetry from belief was the cure, but rather 
        the very crisis which modern poetry must confront. In his response to 
        Richards, Eliot explained his disagreement: </font></p>

            . . We await, in fact (as Mr. Richards is awaiting the future poet),

        essay on Andrewes and his response to Richards are two of the best illustrations 
        of his mindset at the time he reviewed Stein. Shortly after he expresses 
        his admiration for Andrewes&#146;s ability to use style to &quot;drive 
        home&quot; meaning, he condemns a writer who uses nearly identical stylistic 
        techniques, yet who refuses to direct them toward semantic closure. At 
        the same time he declares that poetry can never be separated from belief, 
        he must confront a writer who makes no pretense to believe in anything 
        except that writing should go on, and certainly does not accept that modern 
        writers can live &quot;parasitically&quot; on the &quot;minds of the men 
        of genius of the past.&quot; That her writing does not turn to the past 
        but works exclusively in the present is perhaps her greatest violation 
        of what Eliot believed was important in literature. Because she is a writer 
        offering other aspiring writers a new explanation of how to compose, Gertrude 
        Stein threatens the literary tradition itself. By introducing a new writing 
        logic based on the transitive parts of speech, phonetic affinity, rhythmic 
        and syntactic flow, and the constant movement forward of repetition, Stein 
        creates the foundation for a counter-tradition which will not define itself 
        according to the principles of the existing &quot;ideal order.&quot; And 
        if Gertrude Stein&#146;s remarkable achievements with repetition in &quot;Sitwell 
        Edith Sitwell,&quot; &quot;The fifteenth of November,&quot; and her entire 
        body of work teach us anything, it is that repetition is not to be feared, 
        but to be celebrated as creation itself. </font></p>
