        (Picasso among them) that she looked like a Roman emperor. There is, in 
        this assimilation, the shared acknowledgment of Gertrude Stein’s power 
        and authority. But Djuna Barnes—and, later on, Jo Davidson and Picabia 
        —will portray her as an Oriental icon. Another kind of charisma. How is 
        that possible? How do the two opposite attributions cope with each other? 
        Is this double representation of Eastern peacefulness and Western assertiveness 
        purely accidental? Or subtly intentional? And if so, whose intention does

        is likely that the choice of many artists close to Gertrude Stein to represent 
        her in an Oriental guise, derives from Stein’s willingness to appear not 
        only open, but eager to incorporate the Oriental posture and frame of 
        mind. There are certain biographical elements that may support this observation: 
        for instance, her friendship (in the 1890s) with the Boston Orientalist 
        Thomas Whittemore, who “when a great collection of Chinese paintings arrived

        again reports about Gertrude’s “lapis lazuli Chinese mandarin chain” (44)

        a letter dated December 22nd, 1895, from Leo Stein to Gertrude, in which 
        he sends her his address in Kyoto, one of the stops during his tour of 
        several months with Hutchins Hapgood in the Far-East. The address is naturally 
        in Chinese ideogrammatic characters. Finally, in this speculative list, 
        when describing her Chinese servant, Trac, Gertrude hints at his “different”

        her writings, Stein made explicit declarations of engagement with Eastern 
        modalities and practices. Let’s consider again, for instance, the mature 
        <i>What Are Master-pieces</i> (1922-36), where the issue of an East/West 
        confrontation of aesthetic and existential categories, is diffusely faced 
        (see Shawn H. Alfrey’s essay “ ‘Oriental Peaceful Penetration’: Gertrude 
        Stein and the End of Europe”, 1997). Alfray approaches the question of 
        Stein’s interest in the East, starting from geographical and sociological 
        considerations, to eventually touch on some deeper aesthetic consequences 
        visible in her ideology of writing, definable as “Oriental peaceful penetration”. 
        Actually, Alfray is inclined to present Stein’s favourable bias towards 
        the Eastern culture, not only as the expression of an idiosyncratic form 
        of Orientalism, different from the standard one then in fashion, but also 
        as the very cipher of her peculiar kind of Modernism: more than inspiration, 
        a form of affiliation. “…to an American particularly a Pacific Coast American 
        the Orient was not a romance not necessarily an adventure, it was something 
        different altogether”, Stein herself claims in <i>What Are Master-pieces</i> 
        (66). </font></p>

18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Alfrey goes 
        on to say that “[Stein’s] writing of this period [1934] is obviously unconcerned 
        with the accurate definition and representation of the Orient; it seems 
        alternately a loose confederation of place names or even a state of being. 
        […] China appears as a figure not merely for the exotic or esoteric, but 
        for all of knowledge” (406-7); “Oriental knowledge, for Stein, disrupts 
        the settled forms of western.</font></p>

        giving support to her literary experiments” (409). We are confronted with 
        a series of dense statements or explanations, emerging from within the 
        very making, occurring, shaping, of Stein’s writing.</font></p>

        writing is not a matter of description—placing conventional signs of referential 
        signification in space—but of enactment —giving the processual quality 
        of entities existing in time. Words, therefore, are like the pebbles that 
        Oriental people use to count. Counting and thinking—psychologists, mathematicians, 
        linguists all agree—are akin. Language, in order to become the closest 
        and most adherent expression of thinking—which is Stein’s most urgent 
        goal—had better follow the rules of original counting, and narrative, 
        the same sequencing, in terms of time, of the mind. </font></p>

              Stein attributes to “Chinamen” and Spaniards is in fact analogous 
              to the narrative style through which Stein constructs her “continuous 
              present”. From <i>Three Lives</i> on, Stein had explored the time 
              of being through her technique of simple repetions. Throughout her 
              career, both visually and audibly, Stein’s own writing reads like 
              the piling on of pebble after pebble of text, till the accumulations

        argue that this all-invading temporal dimension is not carried over in 
        language by the agency of repetition. How could it not be? Repetition 
        is the only linguistic device capable of rendering the dynamic quality 
        of succession and process on the page. But there is more in it, in repetition 
        in Stein, I mean, than just time. The parallel presence of repetition 
        with the unrolling of time, is correct, but, in my opinion, this is only 
        the first degree of truth in Stein’s use of repetition. We can see more 
        in it, when starting from the temporal notion of repetition, she reaches 
        the punctual and perforating dimension of “insistence”: the initial stage, 
        its medium for asserting the existing, repetition; but the more perfect 
        degree, all the way through time, but beyond time, the unmovability of 
        the One, insistence. This is why Stein couples the terms of repetition 
        and insistence, in her famous lecture “Portraits and Repetition”:</font></p>

              There is the important question of repetition and is there any such 
              thing. Is there repetition or is there insistence. I am inclined 
              to believe there is no such thing as repetition. And really how

        reading this passage, one might think that actually the difference between 
        repetition and insistence is only a matter of diversified emphasis, and 
        that Stein simply reproduces the Oriental postulate that you will never 
        see the same water of a river flow under your eyes. Stein wants to pinpoint 
        the diversifications that time is able to exert, with the simple fact 
        of its ceaseless, on-rushing motion, but, in the end, what she primarily 
        aims at, is to capture the essence of being, the “entity”, “the being 
        being there”. And she wants to do this in, with, via, language. To reassert 
        the presence of being in our linguistic codes of signification we can 
        only use repetition, because our system of linguistic representation is 
        very imperfect and, let’s say, logocentric, but divided, not immanently 
        “logological”. With the Chinese Written Character, the way Fenollosa puts 
        it, we have something different, another realm of existence in language.</font></p>

        to the crucial point of my talk: the ideogrammatic way of figuration retains 
        in itself, at the same time, the same temporal texture and immanent presence 
        of being that Gertrude Stein wanted to reach with her use of repetition, 
        or, insistence.</font></p>

        with his famous seminal essay, written in 1908, prefaced by Pound in 1918, 
        who opens the way to this interpretation. Gertrude Stein might not have 
        been openly aware of the importance of <i>The Chinese Written Character 
        As a Medium for Poetry</i>, but certainly as a student at Harvard when 
        Fenollosa was spreading the news —he had also been made Oriental art curator 
        at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts—she breathed the same air of Eastern 
        thought. </font></p>
      <p class=Rientrocorpodeltesto align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:
18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There are 
        many passages in Fenollosa’s essay that would be interesting to reread 
        in Steinian terms. He claims to be involved, in that essay, with poetry, 
        not language, “yet the roots of poetry are in language” (Fenollosa, 13). 
        He inquires of “a language so alien in form to ours as is Chinese in its 
        written character” asking “in what sense can verse, written in terms of 
        visible hieroglyphics, be reckoned true poetry?” (Fenollosa, 14). The 
        ideogram and Stein’s repetition are carriers, in different ways, of the 
        same modality of signification. Fenollosa defines poetry a “time art”, 
        and with this remark favours my interpretation, which can be exemplified 
        by these two syllogistic equations: 1- poetry is time / the ideogram is 
        poetry / the ideogram is time = 2- poetry is time / repetition is time 
        / repetition is poetry. The ideogram incorporates more than one concept 
        in one only character, and for this becomes poetry; poetry, as a form 
        of “time art”, in the Chinese character simultaneously combines agent, 
        action, place and time, modality and tone, that is, achieves a density 
        of meaning which gives the unity of difference and multiplicity. According 
        to Fenollosa, this is the very essence of poetry, and if only Western

        is very simple, translated into English it becomes: </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        sun rises in the East.</font></p>
      <p class=Rientrocorpodeltesto align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:
18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But in this 
        literal translation much of its intrinsic poetry is missing; in fact, 
        the process of accumulation of concepts which gives result to the meaning 
        of the word “East”, for example, is completely lost. “East” in Chinese 
        is expressed by the symbolized figure of the sun which gets entangled 
        in the branches of a tree; the verb “rises” presents another homology: 
        “the sun is above the horizon, but beyond that the single upright line 
        is like the growing trunk-line of the tree-sign” (Fenollosa, 34). The 
        first word, “sun”, is represented by the single radical “sun” = “Rì”. 
        Analyzing the three characters of this line, we note that each linguistic 
        unit, each ideogram, contains the presence of the radical representing 
        “sun”: in “sun”, because it is the agent; in “rises”, because the verb 
        “to rise” has embodied in itself, etymologically speaking, the idea of 
        the “sun” growing upright from the trunk of a tree; and in “East”, because 
        it is located and perceived as the place where the “sun” rises and, in 
        so doing, gets entangled in the branches of a tree. It is a line which 
        carries intrinsic poetic qualities: it provides the simultaneous presence 
        of different layers of meaning and dramatic power. But in order to achieve 
        this, if we observe the recurring presence of the radical “Rì” (in the 
        figure of a rectangle cut across in the middle) [attach the drawing of 
        the radical, a reapeated image, “the sun”, encl. 5] meant to signify the 
        word “sun”, we will say that there is repetition, without it being perceived 
        as real repetition, therefore there will be rather “insistence”. Each 
        ideogram is different and yet has a degree of similarity, all three incapsulating 
        the same radical meaning “sun”, in combination with the other pictographically 
        signifying elements in each single ideogram, where the performance of 
        the action takes place. The Chinese ideogram is a powerful and compact 
        source of meaning and it uses repetition—a sort of disguised repetition—as 
        its natural resource. Gertrude Stein, with the same urge of dense and 
        multilayered statements of existence, deconstructs her only inherited 
        Western system of linguistic representation, and makes it new, even forcing 
        it to its extreme </font></p>
