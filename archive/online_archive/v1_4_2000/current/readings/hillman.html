      <p><span>           <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
        </font></span><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        Kafka’s interpretation of a classic moment, the Sirens try to seduce Ulysses 
        with their pretense of song, with their silences, rather than with any 
        real singing. He had heard that they would sing; he thinks they are singing 
        when they aren’t, and fills his ears with wax.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;'><a href="#note1"><kbd>1</kbd></a>&nbsp;<a name="back1"></a></span></sup></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>The first poem in Rae Armantrout’s <i>Necromance </i>has the image 
        of a poppy under a tree singing like a Siren with the “morbid/glamor of 
        the singular.” Her Siren artist relies on silence and carefulness for 
        song, “emphasizing correct names/ as if making amends.”</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Though it is the other dominant western symbol system she uses 
        mostly to push against.</font><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span> 
        </span></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>When God sends them out of the garden, the garden bristles. In 
        this opposite of breathing, Armantrout uses a sort of inverse diaspora 
        to convey what happens to energy in gardens. Engaged in creating a trellis 
        for the silence of god to climb on, she breathes back against the silence 
        of god and against traditional kinds of ontogenic mythmaking. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Upset with creation, she posits metaphysical propositions and then 
        takes them back.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>This project of challenging god seems to intensify from book to 
        book.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Her garden says no.  In <i>Necromance</i>, perhaps the most Edenish 
        of her books, some oleander is associated with coral pink lipstick from 
        the fifties, which is associated (through the word “smack”) with a threat.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>In the beginning of this book, images of flame and flowers abound. 
        Eden has disappointed itself and fallen.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span> The sirens also thought something was singing. For Armantrout, 
        this is like Southern California whose garden says no.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>The elegant fall from grace would not be possible without the spareness 
        of the lines, which allow so much room for God’s silent breathing to push 
        back. This is some of what gives her her power, the power of the silent 
        space in the right margin, pushing back against her. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>She works nevertheless very often within judeo-christian mythology 
        rather strictly. She is as she writes recently “falling for biblical resonance.”<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
'><a href="#note2"><kbd>2 </kbd></a><a name="back2"></a></span></sup></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Her chief concern is with the manipulation of perception by culture. 
        The biblical truth is a form of manipulation both in and out of itself. 
        Each of her books has references to the home garden as the original garden, 
        to the afterlife, and makes reference to the Christian meta-story but 
        she needs to change it, to tease it, to expand it by starving it into 
        strong wirey intelligence. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Her writer, seeing God’s impotence, must take charge of the visible.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span> This happens so often that in <i>Precedence</i>, she implores 
        the reader to “think in order/to recall/what the striking thing//resembles.” 
        This is simply that God “so impotently/loved the world.”</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Since a line is a measure of withheld energy, she often writes 
        in the shortest possible lines, as if to use God’s impotence against him. 
        </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Her lines instruct the reading to help give more power, more choice, 
        in the free-will/ fate debate she inherits. Punning and syntactical shifts 
        create a maze in the garden.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span> Early in her poetic career, in <i>Extremities</i>, she is concerned 
        with how to read God lightly: “Paradise/ <i>is</i> golden.// Sun / on 
        wicker chair.// It is as one knew! // The joyful song/ascends.” She yanks 
        Paradise out of itself by italicizing the tiny substanceless word “is.” 
        Not only is the word “golden” inevitably ironic, the whole wispy utterance 
        floats in its loneliness like a seed.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>With Dickinsonian suspicion of the very fact of Paradise with a 
        P, she writes in “Travels”: “‘All the way.’ What could it mean?”</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>That is why in her garden of paradise, her flowers crave silence 
        exactly in the form of the word “silence.” “Among the zinnias, I once 
        thought/ I had recovered silence.” </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Like all good postmodernists, her subject is the matter of her 
        art, and it is a self-reflexive matter. When she uses the iconography 
        of the bible she re-fashions, remakes paradise, remakes gardens, remakes 
        snakes into ouroboroses: her snake is his own fall, he is “damned/because 
        he filled//his own wake/everywhere.../To swallow your own tail—/</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>or 
        tale--/is no longer// an approved form of transportation.” </span></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Making a swift trip from Genesis to Gnosis without loss of entropy, 
        the reinterpreted snake instead of having his head up his ass has his 
        ass in his mouth. Becoming one of both. A divine joke. “Go ahead,/” she 
        tells him, “say anything.”</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Her snake, like her sirens, has feasted on silence by stuffing 
        itself on received language. <sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;'><a href="#note3"><kbd>3</kbd></a> <a name="back3"></a></span></sup></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Elsewhere, Armantrout remakes Jesus getting crossed. Even getting 
        the being saved done efficiently, in “Saved”: “That job. The tabular/empty 
        figures/you enjoyed the rhythm of.// In heaven already?”</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Armantrout’s basic strategy : compression, using the enigmatic, 
        carved line against itself. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>In a poem-long pun, “Crossing,” she plays on the idea of cultural 
        sacrifice. How strange and strong and spare the business of sacrifice 
        is <i>made to seem.</i> “This is where/our history begins./Well, perhaps 
        not/history, but we do/feel ourselves preceded.” The crossing is the transfer 
        of significance from a repression by the father to protection by the mother 
        without there being any particular benefit to the son. Adages sometimes 
        are passed along, as warnings. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>In the poem a desert is crossed, like the Sinai.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>The son is almost sacrificed in a witty noonish-on-Good-Friday 
        landscape which includes the striking image “The sky darkened/then. It 
        seemed/like the wrong end/of a weak simile.” In this manner, in the manner 
        of southern California sunning and deathy irony, she continues her cultural 
        commentary within a metaphysical tradition.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Elsewhere, more Christ and Wordsworth.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>But the references are often muted. In the title poem of <i>Precedence</i>, 
        a dead boy found “‘wrapped around’ [what is she quoting?] a tree...in 
        a roiling wilderness.” </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>An oddly distilled cleverness—like aromatherapy—when Armantrout 
        uses God’s name against him. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>“‘All the way.’ What did it mean?</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>  To enter Paradise with him?” (Travels) </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>But which biblical phrases does she choose to re-vamp? These stanzas 
        aren’t rooms, they’re more like rental storage spaces. “A trademark-like/stuttering.” 
        (That’s a stanza.) They’re the compressed saved part. How deftly she writes, 
        seemingly about her own process, that a phrase is so short it’s “like 
        the hidden name of God.” For one so renegade, it is amusing that she dutifully 
        capitalizes. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>It’s not “clear” what place God has in her perceptual order. What 
        is clear is that she needs to use the tools of the Godstuff to breathe 
        against, in these muscular and precise poems.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Reshuffling the cards—God, garden, Jesus, afterlife, Sunday, saved,—is 
        a way of making the little breeze come about.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>“‘Ha, ha, you missed me,’</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>a dead person says.”</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>In this manner she balances her moral doubt.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Her garden gives way to salad in a diner: “What the cool tomato 
        cubes forming a rosette around this central olive have to do with love 
        and happiness.” (Necromance)</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>The writer, seeing God’s impotence and having pity, takes charge 
        of the visible, which means she has choices.  </font></p>
