      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like other 
        modernist prose writers such as William Faulkner and Katherine Anne Porter, 
        Evelyn Scott began her writing career as a poet.<b><kbd><a href="#note1">1</a> 
        </kbd></b><a name="back1"></a>What is unusual in her case is that she 
        continued to compose and publish poetry throughout her writing career, 
        never relinquishing the idea of herself as a poet, never ceasing to include 
        her poetry as an important part of what she represented as the body of 
        her work&#151;&#151;even though the majority of her energy and the subsequent 
        recognition she received focused on her novels. Her self-understanding 
        as a poet, her identity and practices as a poet, inform the whole of her 
        artistic production because it is in her poetry that she first develops 
        her characteristic individual consciousness, isolated from and opposed 
        by the natural world, society, religion, and, in some important cases, 
        her own self. This isolated self, who sees the world from the standpoint 
        of an outsider, is a consistent figure or trope in her work in all of 
        the genres.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Not surprisingly, 
        then, Scott&#146;s identity as a poet was important to her from her literary 
        debut in 1918 until the end of her career. Scott initiated her career 
        as a poet by publishing &quot;Moon Cycle,&quot; a group of poems she sent 
        to New York from Brazil. This early appearance was followed by other poems 
        in little magazines such as <i>Others</i>,<i> Poetry</i>, and <i>The Dial 
        </i>in 1919 and 1920. These poems defined her as an Imagist whose primary 
        subjects were subjectivity, sexuality, and the exotic Brazilian locales 
        which catalyzed her writing from 1913 until 1919. Her Imagism, however, 
        developed independently and in isolation from that of Ezra Pound, H. D., 
        T. E. Hulme and others, since she began writing poetry while in Brazil, 
        and it differed from theirs in important respects. Her first published 
        book, <i>Precipitations</i>, which appeared in 1920, included these early 
        published poems, yet broadened her scope significantly with the inclusion 
        of many more poems about the city, race, sexual politics, and nature. 
        Scott&#146;s particular contribution to Imagism is that while she depended 
        upon the evocative power of intensely realized imagery, she also used 
        the imagery to provoke the emotional responses of her readers in ways 
        that referred beyond the poems themselves. In fact, her project primarily 
        centered on emotional play, rather than pure images, which brings her 
        closer to the expressionist mode. Open forms, influenced by the work of 
        D. H. Lawrence and William Carlos Williams, provided her with the freedom 
        to experiment. When rhyme and rhythm appear in this early poetry, it is 
        toward specific effects of juxtaposition rather than establishing form 
        for form&#146;s sake.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Early reviewers 
        of <i>Precipitations</i> situated Scott as a modern poet. Padriac Colum 
        in <i>The New Republic</i> stated that Scott &quot;takes us to a place 
        where there are no shared possessions and where there are no springs of 
        action&quot; (305). He associates the isolation and experimentation in 
        the poetry directly with &quot;territory that the moderns have opened 
        up&quot; (305), although he also thought this territory more fruitful 
        for novelists. The detachment with which a riot is described in her poetry, 
        for example, in graphic detail and with concentrated accuracy, but without 
        any sense of action, establishes the detachment of the emotional voice. 
        Rather than reflecting outrage, the distance of the persona in the poem 
        allows Scott to represent a more objective voice. Mark Van Doren reviewed 
        <i>Precipitations</i> for <i>The Nation</i>, describing Scott&#146;s poetry 
        as radical impressionism, and finding Scott apprehending new subjects 
        in new ways: &quot;At no time do the walls of tradition serve her, either 
        as mirrors or as sounding boards.&quot; Lola Ridge, in reviewing <i>Precipitations</i> 
        for <i>Poetry</i>, characterized Scott&#146;s poetic voice as &quot;like 
        an electric ray, that seems to focus&#151;&#151;almost lovingly&#151;&#151;upon 
        decay and death, with a child&#146;s simplicity and eager response to 
        every mood of earth&quot; (334). She also places Scott as a modernist: 
        &quot;These poems show an astonishing and essentially modern awareness...it 
        is a consciousness that, while close to and keenly aware of instinct, 
        has yet obtained its release; so that it watches, intent but calmly elect&quot; 
        (336-37). Although <i>Precipitations</i> was not widely reviewed, the 
        criticism following the volume shows attention to Scott&#146;s place as 
        a modernist, her use of imagery, and her concentration on death as a subject 
        intertwined with fecundity and life.<a href="#note2"><b><kbd>2</kbd></b></a> 
        <a name="back2"></a> </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As the title 
        of Scott&#146;s first volume of poetry suggests, her early poetry functions 
        in the mode of a precipitate, or condensation of thought and feeling for 
        her. The poems are short, free verse; some are rhythmical, some are rhymed. 
        They are frequently synesthetic and synesthetically paradoxical. The volume 
        is arranged in six main sections entitled: &quot;Manhattan,&quot; &quot;Vanities,&quot; 
        &quot;Bruised Sunlight,&quot; &quot;Contemporaries,&quot; &quot;Brazil 
        through a Mist,&quot; and &quot;The Coming of Christ.&quot; Each of these 
        main sections has two or three poem cycles, each with separate titles, 
        and each cycle is composed of between four to sixteen short poems, also 
        titled separately. This hierarchy of structure promotes an interweaving 
        of themes throughout the volume, while also emphasizing continuity within 
        the parts. The poetry cycle was a method of organization that Scott frequently 
        used in the earliest of her published poetry. It seems to provide a combination 
        of focused investigations through individual lyrics as well as opportunities 
        for sustained development across poems or poem cycles.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The poems 
        in <i>Precipitations</i> have a broad surface scope, and they have subterranean 
        commonalities as well. Broadly, they deal with Scott&#146;s experience 
        of Brazil, her transition to living in New York, the female body, physical 
        pain, maternity, character studies and portraits of contemporaries, and 
        evocations of mood. While they seldom represent their subjects in &quot;harsh 
        outline&quot; but rather work by indirection, Scott nevertheless wrote 
        vividly of the things she chose as her subjects. She dwells on color, 
        light, and shape with precise detail, while allowing a blending of perceptions 
        to inform the representations in the poems. Poems of all subjects share 
        a doubling back on itself of the poet&#146;s vision, which causes the 
        blurring of the distinction between subject and object. In these poems, 
        Scott also portrays forces which work against rational thought such as 
        maternal instinct, mob violence, and narcissism as monstrous and threatening. 
        Her primary critique of modern culture rests with her examination of forces 
        and urges that thwart rational thought.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Scott&#146;s 
        project in <i>Precipitations </i>is not only to capture sensual images 
        but to reproduce specific experiences of perceiving the images, and to 
        construct associations that unseat the reader. The anxiety these techniques 
        produce seem to be one of Scott&#146;s main goals in writing. The anxiety 
        may serve to highlight certain philosophical or social dilemmas or contradictions 
        which she chooses to focus on in a particular poem. In order to achieve 
        these effects, the voice in her poems is frequently narcissistic to the 
        point that the boundaries of self are often called into question. Added 
        to this experimental voice in her poetry, Scott also interweaves, for 
        the time, persistent and daring references to female eroticism, as well 
        as focusing on what one might identify as the hideous in many of the poems. 
        Scott was one of the earliest writers to recognize and exploit the socially 
        constructed association between the female body and irrational thought. 
        By exposing the link of the female body to irrationality and generating 
        anxiety about it, Scott intends to force her readers into new ways of 
        thinking about women. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The natural 
        world, also associated with the female body, is portrayed as indifferent 
        both to the joy and suffering of the persona, although it evokes both 
        emotional responses. In contrast, the city (specifically New York) becomes 
        an adjunct of nature, both terrible for the mobs it is haven to and beautiful 
        in its stony composure and implacability. Neither it, nor nature, it seems, 
        will be altered by the boundless and frantic persona who cannot remove 
        her eye from either beauty or ugliness but regards both with an equal 
        share of fascination and wonder. In reading Scott&#146;s poetry the reader 
        is absorbed by the perspective of this persona and engulfed in the natural 
        forces which seem to buffet her.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A unifying 
        theme in <i>Precipitations</i> is the isolation of the individual. The 
        first section, entitled &quot;Manhattan&quot; and containing two poem 
        cycles, &quot;The Unpeopled City&quot; and &quot;Crowds,&quot; explores 
        the paradoxes of isolation within a most populated place, New York City. 
        In &quot;The Unpeopled City,&quot; for instance, the poem &quot;Midnight 
        Worship: Brooklyn Bridge,&quot; the first poem of the volume, describes 
        street lamps along the bridge as subjectively perceived saints whose nimbuses 
        hover above as a trick of the light. The lamps have will and agency in 
        the poem in contrast to the paralysis of the speaker. In a later poem 
        of &quot;The Unpeopled City,&quot; entitled &quot;From Brooklyn,&quot; 
        the persona describes the perceived floating of Manhattan across the river: 
        &quot;Dim gardens of fire&#151; / And rushing invisible toward me through 
        the fog, / A hurricane of faces.&quot; Other people, crowds in fact, pose 
        a direct threat to her viability as an individual. Robert Welker, in his 
        1958 dissertation, described &quot;From Brooklyn&quot; as an example of 
        purely Imagist verse, emphasizing the way in which the description exists 
        for its own sake and doesn&#146;t seem to reach out toward a larger web 
        of meaning beyond itself.<a href="#note3"><b><kbd>3</kbd></b></a> <a name="back3"></a>The 
        persona perceives Manhattan as a unity floating across the river, but 
        at the same time she is overwhelmed by the crowds that she knows the city 
        contains. Faces, the vehicles of individuality, merge in a storm that 
        overwhelms her.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the second 
        poem cycle of &quot;Manhattan,&quot; entitled &quot;Crowds,&quot; Scott 
        further examines the isolation of individuals and their control by natural 
        urges within the framework of civilization. In a brief poem entitled &quot;New 
        York,&quot; Scott subjectivizes the landscape of New York to include natural 
        images of destruction:</font></p>

18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The city&#146;s 
        buildings are described as a herd of animals large enough to dwarf the 
        individual human lives contained within. Scott&#146;s use of the descriptive 
        terms &quot;diaphanous&quot; and &quot;velvet&quot; depict sensual contradictions, 
        a favorite device. The buildings are diaphanous because while seeming 
        solid from a distance they are in fact hollow; perhaps the lives that 
        are led in such buildings, lives of business and commerce, exert the velvet 
        yet inexorable forces that press humanity back into the earth. Scott describes 
        human beings as merely bodies, dwarfed and inconsequential&#151;&#151;they 
        may as well be ants, for all the individual significance they exert. The 
        indifference of the city is further elaborated in this cycle in a poem 
        entitled &quot;Sunset: Battery Park&quot; where the sunset, reflected 
        from the windows of houses, turns the windows into eyes which gaze back 
        at the persona in sightless, expressionless judgement. The sight lines 
        &quot;obliterate all they see&quot; and Scott concludes the poem by describing 
        the crowds below the buildings as contiguous, one being, melting &quot;seaward 
        and deathward&quot; to the ocean like those not fully alive. They can&#146;t 
        recognize the landscape around them or the cost to themselves of following 
        their blind urges. The persona is then a lone voice of protest among many 
        who seem themselves to refrain from thinking and judgement.</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        unconscious, multiple will is a monstrous force which is made up of individuals 
        and dominates their will to its own. In &quot;City at Night&quot; this 
        is expressed in the image of life as wormlike, wriggling, and without 
        mind. The individuals who travel in the night are described as subject 
        to a will larger than their own. The monstrous quality seems to be due 
        to a lack of specific intelligence or realized personality. &quot;A passion 
        without any master,&quot; in whatever form it takes in Scott&#146;s poetry, 
        is depicted as dangerous. Sexual fluid as acidic or as burning is both 
        responsible for new life but is also a poisonous harbinger of the strife 
        that new life may bring. The city represents a human hive-like existence 
        which Scott contrasts to a terrible peace she knew in the isolation of 
        the Brazilian ranch. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the next 
        section of poetry, entitled &quot;Vanities,&quot; Scott turns her attention 
        to family relationships and Christian imagery. Three cycles, &quot;Bread 
        Poems,&quot; &quot;The Red Cross,&quot; and &quot;Domestic Canticle,&quot; 
        explore family emotional dynamics interwoven with a strong critique of 
        Christian values and doctrine. Scott also continues in this section her 
        commitment to analyze irrationality. In these sections she finds that 
        many familial relationships are based on irrational motives and thought. 
        She pays particular attention to the maternal relationship.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In &quot;Embarkation 
        of Cythera&quot; Scott offers a brief poem of stasis and stagnation. Cythera 
        is a Greek island historically associated with the goddess Aphrodite. 
        &quot;Embarkation of Cythera&quot; then would be freight transported from 
        Cythera by ship; Scott suggests that her own body is the cargo from this 
        sensual point of departure. Sexual pleasure and death are distinctly linked 
        in this poem. The libidinal knowledge of the persona&#146;s boundaries 
        are blurred in the warm stagnance of the bath. In the libidinal spaces 
        the distinctions between inside and outside, usually easy to make, grow 
        confusing. The water which penetrates the persona makes the sense of her 
        particular self seem less definite. The climax of the poem, it is suggested, 
        is a synchronous experience of orgasm and death. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;Christian 
        Luxuries,&quot; &quot;Maternal Breast,&quot; and &quot;The Shadow that 
        Walks Alone&quot; join &quot;Embarkation of Cythera&quot; in exploring 
        the sensual experience of the female body. In &quot;Christian Luxuries&quot; 
        Scott indicates that the luxury that Christians enjoy is the sense of 
        sin. The feeling of sin is described as a delicious indulgence, a debauching 
        of responsibility for one&#146;s actions. Once again we find the persona 
        in a bath, yet this time it is described as a red fountain of shame which 
        generates from her heart. The fountain is simultaneously the natural flow 
        of blood in veins as well as an explosive display of excess suggestive 
        of menstruation. In an exercise in sensual paradox, Scott claims &quot;the 
        fire is cool. / It cannot burn me.&quot; Sensual paradox, or synesthetic 
        paradox, is one of Scott&#146;s anxiety producing poetic devices. By saying 
        sin is a cool fire she indicates the central paradox of sin&#151;&#151;it 
        is felt both openly as pain and subterraneously as pleasure. In this poem 
        she directs the reader&#146;s attention to long held assumptions about 
        sin and religious practice, with the intention of debunking them as self 
        serving and hypocritical. The female body is an appropriate trope for 
        this admixture of feeling in its experience of a monthly cycle beyond 
        its own control, and the social stigma historically placed upon the menstrual 
        cycle.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In &quot;The 
        Maternal Breast&quot; the persona experiences a deep desire for a maternal 
        sanctuary. The mother, it is suggested, can be a location of refuge, a 
        place. This poem is additionally interesting when one is aware of the 
        deeply conflicted relationship Scott had with her mother, Maude Dunn. 
        In <i>Escapade</i>, she shifted the roles of the principle parental figures 
        to an aunt and uncle, which no doubt served, as she claimed, to protect 
        the identities of her actual parents. but it may also have provided a 
        crucial psychological distancing from her mother, who, disguised as an 
        aunt, became a key figure in the narrative. In this poem, the persona 
        seeks an ideal mother, a figure of plenty, like the statue of Diana of 
        the Ephesians, with her many breasts. The quest for the ideal mother, 
        who is a function of giving beyond all reason with no sense of her own 
        self, goes unfulfilled for Scott in the poem. &quot;I was looking for 
        a hill of mounds hairy with grass / And a place to lie down.&quot; The 
        closing of this poem suggests not only a return to the safety of a womb, 
        but also a final resting place, a graveyard. In this double image, Scott 
        suggest how impossible it would be for any individual to fulfill such 
        a need. the &quot;ideal&quot; maternal breast she seeks can never be found.

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Evelyn Scott&#146;s 
        world in <i>Precipitations</i> is a haunted one&#151;haunted not by ghosts, 
        but by absence, a refusal of nature to provide coherent meanings to the 
        one who seeks them, a failure of the individual to integrate into any 
        possible context of self, family, community or world. Nature is mute with 
        regard to meaning, mute yet at the same time brimming with puzzling spectacles 
        of life that strongly seem to indicate&#133;what? Marooned in this conundrum, 
        frustrated in the attempt to find meaning in nature, Scott&#146;s poetic 
        personae frequently turn inward, focusing on their own isolated subjectivity 
        defined by the stark fact of its being surrounded by a recalcitrant nature. 
        The urge to wrest meaning from mute, mocking nature is obsessive&#151;almost 
        uncontrollable&#151;so much so that this anthropomorphizing of natural 
        objects shows nature in a willful and active refusal of the persona&#146;s 
        questioning: tree limbs grip, hills push, twigs grasp&#151;but none communicate. 
        Nature, endowed with will and intention, implicates the subjectivity of 
        the persona, despite her objective recognition of her unavoidable subjectivity 
        and individual bias. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The tension 
        between the intense isolation of the persona and the insistent yet inscrutable 
        press of nature surrounding her is particularly keen when Scott&#146;s 
        poetry turns to a woman&#146;s ambiguous role in the natural world as 
        a mother, focusing on the contradictions between her individual will and 
        the obscure imperatives that nature imposes on her. With cold, rational 
        detachment she separates all necessary causal connections between maternal 
        love and the &quot;natural&quot; act of giving birth. To give birth is 
        not necessarily to be a mother&#151;and to be a mother is not determined 
        by nature which is known to be silent and impotent in asserting its will. 
        If, as is the case in <i>Precipitations</i>, maternity is not determined 
        and directed by nature, then it is not bounded by nature and subject to 
        its norms. Instead maternity is determined by the poet, just as her perceptions 
        of nature were directed by her poetic faculties.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Although 
        the subjectivity Scott projects in her poems is often confused about its 
        identity or unsure of the status of its reality, it nonetheless always 
        serves as the primary perceiver, the acknowledged perceiver, the frame 
        through which what is seen is shaped. In the case of observing the natural 
        world, this leads the persona to a heightened sense of isolation and purposelessness. 
        In the case of maternity, it causes her to adopt an intensely personal 
        and transgressive role. The poetic faculty in each case is given a position 
        of unrivaled importance. The radical importance of the poetic faculty 
        in shaping experience is a distinguishing characteristic of Scott&#146;s 
        work. However, Scott&#146;s poetry does not posit any deliverance from 
        the entanglements of subjectivity. Her silence on this subject is also 
        unique. While she at times evinces frustration at the ineluctable paradoxes 
        of life, there is also an erotic enjoyment of the fractile structures 
        of experience. The &quot;I,&quot; the thread of continuity, is constituted 
        by the desiring self, desiring, often, and at crucial moments, primarily 
        a surcease of desire. </font></p>
