        will begin with a passage from <i>Trimmings</i>: Harryette Mullen's 1991 
        book of prose poems that expose and connect a network of assumptions and 
        perceptions about the raced and sexualized female body and the language 
        of beauty, clothing, and skin found in advertising. With both the casualness 
        of spoken, off-the-cuff contemporary vernacular and the shaped precisions 
        and ironic pauses of modernist poetry, Mullen links objectified female 
        sexuality, clothing, food, color, and language to subtly reveal the humor 
        and pathos of a bride thickly wrapped in the objectifying and stultifying 
        layers of a wedding dress:</font></p>

          <td width="88%"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
            bride wore white. Posed in modest bodice a la mode. Cake with sugar 
            rosebuds and white frosting. Everyone gets a piece. Off-color jokes, 
            borrowed and blue. Her blush, tip of the iceberg, froze in layers 
            of lace, in a photograph of her smile. (36)</font></td>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since 
        the image of the bride on the wedding cake metonymically represents the 
        actual bride physically carrying the thick, white, sugary layers of her 
        wedding dress, and the cake is something everyone gets a "piece" of, this 
        prose poem comments on the sexual availability (and even violence) that 
        weddings both repress and express. And by sliding easily back and forth 
        between the material, spoken, unquestioned surface of the idiomatic language 
        of weddings and its often hidden ideological connotations, Mullen shows 
        that at least figuratively, a taste of the bride's sexuality is a part 
        of a wedding's ritual exchange.</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While 
        it is pleasurable to trace Mullen's sly verbal winks and playful critiques, 
        it is important not to rest easy with the interpretative pleasures her 
        work requires and inspires. In addition to closely tracing her lyrical 
        strategies, I would like to place Mullen's work in the context of the 
        literary tradition it alludes to, especially considering Mullen's own 
        statements about the way her work has been represented and marketed. In 
        an essay titled "Poetry and Identity," Mullen articulates the two often 
        mutually exclusive categories that poets are commonly placed in: poets 
        of color and "formally innovative poets." She discusses the difficulty 
        of placing, and therefore exposing, work that falls into both categories, 
        and the consequences of that difficulty for the writer:</font></p>

          <td width="88%"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Formally 
            innovative minority poets,' when visible at all, are not likely to 
            be perceived either as typical of a racial/ethnic group, or as representative 
            of an aesthetic movement. Their unaccountable existence therefore 
            strains the seams of the critical narratives necessary to make them 
            (individually and collectively) comprehensible, and thus teachable 
            and marketable. In each generation, the erasure of the anomalous black 
            writer abets the construction of a continuous, internally consistent 
            tradition, while at the same time it deprives the idiosyncratic minority 
            artist a history, compelling her to struggle even harder to construct 
            a cultural context out of her own radical individuality. She is unanticipated 
            and often unacknowledged due to the imposed obscurity of her aesthetic 
            antecedents. (85)</font></td>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
        begin giving Mullen's anomalous, idiosyncratic work a literary history, 
        I would like to place <i>Trimmings</i> within the context of two American 
        women writers who are often not formally or thematically linked: Gertrude 
        Stein and Zora Neale Hurston. Mullen never directly cites the work of 
        Hurston and Stein in <i>Trimmings</i>, but I want to claim that their 
        innovative strategies can be seen within Mullen's text without much hermeneutic 
        scrutiny. I've chosen to focus on "visibility" in my interpretative thematic 
        because seeing Stein's and Hurston's presence in the text helps readers 
        see the way Mullen's condensed, multi-layered, poetic collages call attention 
        to language's construction of visual perception by telling the piece by 
        piece story of an image's construction and its social connotations. <i>Trimmings</i> 
        shows readers that language constructs perception in ways we don't readily 
        "see" while we participate in its quotidian transactions, but also that 
        language placed in juxtaposition with visual images can defamiliarize 
        the habitual ways those images are perceived. At the end of this essay 
        I will analyze Mullen's critique of that icon of modernism, Edouard Manet's 
        <i>Olympia,</i> by focussing on language's ability, particularly language 
        such as Mullen's&#150;playfully, lyrically, and ironically rendered&#150;to 
        defamiliarize the images of modernism. So without reducing Mullen's text 
        to its influences, I would like this essay to begin a reading of <i>Trimmings</i> 
        that flexibly moves through the poet's simultaneous use and critique of 
        both Stein's and Hurston's work, while also attending to <i>Trimmings</i> 
        as text that brings together the work of two modernist women writers in 
        order to critique modernism's racial and gendered dependencies and divides.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Stein's 
        1914 text, <i>Tender Buttons,</i> is often cited as a foundational text 
        for the innovations in contemporary poetry. In its experimental rendering 
        of the signs that suggest a domestic and feminine world, its logical disjunctions 
        and manipulations of syntax, and its play with part and whole, the strategies 
        of <i>Tender Buttons</i> is clearly as an influence on Mullen's <i>Trimmings</i>. 
        Stein's <i>Tender Buttons</i> helps provide a context for interpreting 
        <i>Trimmings</i>, while also demonstrating how contemporary poets such 
        as Mullen still continue to work within frameworks set up by modern poetry, 
        particularly modern poetry such as Stein's which was ignored by the Anglo-American 
        New Criticism that established figures such as T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound 
        in the academy. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Stein's 
        work was known but pointedly ignored by the fathers of New Criticism, 
        but the work of Zora Neale Hurston, the African-American folklorist and 
        fiction writer, was unknown to them and not even marginally considered. 
        Mullen's text, however, draws as much from the styles, ideas, and methods 
        in Hurston's 1934 essay "Characteristics of Negro Expression " as it does 
        from Mullen's work. Hurston's essay was published in Nancy Cunard's <i>Negro: 
        An Anthology</i>, a project devoted to charting parallel preoccupations 
        in the Harlem Renaissance and American Modernism, and is, according to 
        Michael North, "a quintessential modernist production" (177). Because 
        of its attention to the way language shapes visual perception, Hurston's 
        text helps exemplify the modernism of <i>Negro: An Anthology</i>. </font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">According 
        to Hurston, Negro Expressions are far from detached and abstract, but 
        instead portray the visual aspects of an object as well as the way it 
        is humanly, actively used. For example, instead of "chair," a word distanced 
        from the image of actually sitting in a chair, African-Americans say, 
        according to Hurston, "that which we squat upon" (830). This phrase is 
        an example of what Hurston calls the characteristic "will to adorn," which 
        also manifests itself in the propensity to use metaphor and simile ("Yo 
        sho propaganda"), the double descriptive ("Low down"), and verbal nouns, 
        ("She features someone I know") (830). Following the verbal style Hurston 
        articulates, Mullen turns verbs into nouns to playfully exploit puns. 
        In the following line, Mullen turns the noun "pants" into the verbs "pants" 
        in order to show a relation between the expressions of sexual arousal 
        and the discomfort of tightly fitting jeans, "Jeans so tight, she pants" 
        (32). Mullen also utilizes verbal nouns to reveal how the objects that 
        adorn women become the means through which they are perceived. For example, 
        Mullen begins a prose poem with the line, "Girl, pinked, beribboned." 
        "Pink" usually operates as a noun or adjective, but to describe a girl 
        as "pinked" suggests that by wearing this color as well as its connotations 
        of a sweet, girlish femininity, the girl becomes the gendered qualities 
        associated with that color. As Mullen writes in the epilogue to <i>Trimmings</i>, 
        pink and white have a particular resonance for African-American women:

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        <i>Trimmings,</i> Mullen's critique of the racialized dimension of the 
        contemporary commercial language of beauty isn't distinct from her critique 
        of the sexualized and objectified female body of advertising. These two 
        critiques are often indistinguishable from each other, arising subtly 
        out of Mullen's deft and ironic handling of advertising's words and images. 
        In the following prose poem, Mullen calls attention to the words that 
        express ideas about money and luxury and inform the sexualized language 
        of pantyhose. In the last line, when she mentions "blue vein stock," Mullen 
        calls attention to the way whiteness underlies that pretty and rich and 
        luxurious image. </font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In her essay 
        "&#145;Ruses of the lunatic muse': Harryette Mullen and Lyric Hybridity, 
        " Elizabeth Frost writes that Mullen's work "fosters a linguistic multiplicity 
        that displays, often revels in, the varied lexicons of contemporary American 
        Culture..." (2). I would add to this statement by claiming that <i>Trimmings</i> 
        also displays the dense linguistic methods of both American modernism 
        and the Harlem Renaissance, two intersecting literary movements that North 
        describes as "...two different modernisms, tightly linked"(11). If the 
        intersections rather than the distinctions between modernisms are kept 
        in mind, with Hurston and Stein representing two strains, <i>Trimmings</i> 
        becomes readable as a text calling attention to arbitrary constructions 
        of race and gender, while at the same time linking segregated strains 
        of American modernism. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">From Stein's 
        work, Mullen extracts associational logic, verbal density that resists 
        complete interpretive mastery by the reader, and a detached and idiosyncratic 
        authorial presence. From Hurston's work, Mullen extracts the performative 
        and mimetic qualities of African-America dialect and its highly visual 
        components while also emphasizing the way language participates in and 
        shapes cultural and economic exchanges. Mullen's use of a contemporary 
        vernacular, combined with an ironic skepticism, makes explicit the feminist 
        critique often implicit in Stein's innovative poetic structures. In Catherine 
        Stimpson's words, Stein's poetry "...is a series of propositions about 
        the possibilities of transposing gender, about the possibilities of breaking 
        up its orders, codes, and poses" (2). From both Stein and Hurston, <i>Trimmings</i> 
        gleans a subject&#150;"clothing" and "adornments"&#150;as well as a pleasurable 
        exploration of the sensual, material, and fluid qualities of language. 
        And with their verbal and visual plays with the components of perception, 
        both Stein's and Hurston's texts offer models and methods for defamiliarizing 
        the way we physically see and ideologically perceive the intersections 
        of gender, sexuality, race, and the economics of "beauty." </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While Hurston's 
        "Characteristics of Negro Expression" and Stein's <i>Tender Buttons</i> 
        seem to be the most influential and easily discernible textual backdrops 
        for <i>Trimmings</i>, Mullen's project is obviously not limited to a dialogue 
        with her modernist predecessors. To their linguistic insights, Mullen 
        brings her gift for catching the cadences of meaning within idiomatic 
        fragments and then constructing poetic narratives that draw out those 
        meanings in order to critique their ideological dimensions. This combination 
        of modernism and contemporary ideological critique makes Mullen a poet 
        of postmodernist resistance. <i>Trimmings</i> deconstructs modernism "not 
        to seal it in its own image," as Hal Foster describes, "but in order to 
        open it, rewrite it." (xii). And though it critically revises some aspects 
        of literary modernism, <i>Trimmings</i> is not simply a stylistic enactment 
        of a postmodern profusion of simulacra or the potential hybrid of languages 
        and images from contemporary culture, but articulates an oppositional 
        critique that challenges master narratives of modern and contemporary 
        culture by working within and against them. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Because 
        <i>Tender Buttons</i> dramatically widens the gap between objects and 
        the words usually used to identify them Stein's text can be seen as a 
        model informing Mullen's critique. Therefore <i>Tender Buttons </i>is 
        not, as Frost claims in her essay "Signify(g) on Stein: The Revisionist 
        Poetics of Harryette Mullen and Leslie Scalapino," "an unabashedly closed 
        text," but a radically open one (2). Frost argues that <i>Trimmings</i> 
        can be read as a critique of the omissions in Stein's text. While I agree 
        that Mullen includes "language of the street and marketplace" and "revises 
        Stein's poetics to illuminate a locus of the political and the erotic," 
        the idea that Mullen exclusively critiques Stein's text, instead of working 
        both in and against it, denies Stein's innovative influence and her subversive 
        place in the modernist canon. <i>Tender Buttons</i> allows for interpretative 
        insertions such as Mullen's that expose and critique the raced and gendered 
        assumptions within the vocabularies used to commodify women's bodies, 
        vocabularies that more than often assume that those bodies are white. 
        </font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
        Stein writes in a small section from <i>Tender Buttons</i> entitled "A 
        Piece of Coffee," "A single image is not splendor" she may be critiquing, 
        as Peter Nichols points out, Ezra Pound's criteria of imagism&#150;"direct 
        treatment of the thing"&#150;as well as T.S. Eliot's "objective correlative." 
        Unlike Eliot and Pound, Stein, Hurston, and Mullen do not attempt, in 
        Nichol's words, to "produce a balance of internal and external worlds." 
        All three writers attempt to disrupt that balance in order to call into 
        question and defamiliarize conventional description and narrative forms 
        of writing, that, in Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrew's words, make 
        language transparent, "leaving a picture of a physical world the reader 
        can consume as if it were a commodity" (x). Hurston's emphasis on the 
        voluptuous language of adornment, as well as angular and asymmetrical 
        images and expressions, works against standards of transparency. And on 
        page 16 of <i>Trimmings</i>, Mullen employs these disruptive tendencies 
        to call attention to the white basis in pantyhose and tanning products. 
        Here Mullen reveals the way these languages and images together work to 
        compose a commodified but supposedly "natural" image of a woman by denaturalizing 
        and disrupting these commercial images and playfully punning on the images 
        and words she is composed with, images and words associated with economic 
        language&#150;"summer stock"&#150;and sexualized threats&#150;"body stalking."</font></p>

        and our perceptions of physicality. In the opening pages of <i>Mules and

        lives and habits but cannot perceive. When asked to collect Negro folklore,

        corner lounger," Hurston versifies in a language that resembles in rhythm 
        and cadence Mullen's and Stein's, "A hippy undulation below the waist 
        that is a sheaf of promises tied with conscious power" (831).</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        first prose poem in <i>Trimmings</i> demonstrates Hurston's earlier perception 
        that rhythmical language, sexuality, and economic exchange are all intimately 
        tied and performed together, while also revealing and critiquing how a 
        woman will "become" the object she adorns. Or, to put it in slangier terms, 
        Mullen's text performs the accessories "suck[ing]her in":</font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In this 
        passage, Mullen draws attention to the fact that the belt is paradoxically 
        "added" to a woman's body in order to "divide" and "subtract" but also 
        "multiply a look" (words that also suggest monetary exchanges). This prose 
        poem also shows how the belt visually takes the place of the waist&#150;"becomes 
        the waist"&#150;by punning off the compliment that the belt is "becoming" 
        to a small waist. Not only does the belt define the waist, but it effects 
        the woman's facial expression, "Sucks her in. She buckles. Smiles, tighter." 
        Within this literal, physical, and visual constraint, the woman in the 
        poem has been conditioned, trained really, to quickly "spot the bulge 
        below the belt." This phrase brings to mind images of women scrutinizing 
        themselves for "bulges," but also men's physical signs of sexual attraction.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To arrive 
        at and present this lyrical, cultural critique, Mullen deliberately avoids 
        the inscription of the lyric and subjective "I." Her detachment, as well 
        as her immersion within the materiality of language, is characteristic 
        of Stein's work as well. While both <i>Trimmings</i> and <i>Tender Buttons</i> 
        are definitely idiosyncratic, the poet's personas are not present except 
        as perhaps distant, depersonalized arrangers of their language constellations. 
        In place of the "I," the reader must insert her perceptions and construct 
        her own meanings that will never be corroborated by the text.</font></p>
      <p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        want to offer one such speculative reading of a Steinian piece of clothing 
        and then see Mullen's additions to and revisions of it, additions and 
        revisions that Hurston's more explicit emphasis on sexuality, exchange, 
        and performative language help provide. Stein's entry, "A Petticoat," 
        provides four different and interconnected ways of perceiving that petticoat: 
        "A light white, a disgrace, an ink spot, a rosy charm" (13). In this poetic 
        equation, readers confront not only the color associated with a petticoat&#150;"a 
        light white"&#150;but also the fact that we know what a petticoat is by 
        what it isn't, by what defiles that whiteness&#150;"an ink spot"&#150;as 
        well as the moral and abstract language used to describe that negation, 
        "a disgrace" (13). After reading the phrases "a disgrace" and "an ink 
        spot," "A Petticoat" takes on moral and sexual connotations that can be 
        disgraced by the subversive act of writing, signified by the ink spot. 
        Stein ends the sentence with the phrase "a rosy charm" perhaps to pull 
        the reader away from the binaries that separate what the object "is" and 
        "isn't," and perhaps by analogy, the binaries of purity and disgrace. 
        She therefore implicitly argues that writing can bring color and description 
        to an object&#150;"a rosy charm"&#150;without necessarily reifying moral 
        and sexual connotations. In the following passage, Mullen translates "a 
        rosy charm" into the color pink and then critiques the racial implications 
        of using this color to describe a woman's femininity by calling attention 
        to the way a construction of feminine whiteness is defined by its cultural 
        shadow and negation, black femininity:</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Mullen 
        works within and against Stein's vocabulary for defining the petticoat 
        to verbally mimic, critique, and disrupt the visual configuration of Edouard 
        Manet's <i>Olympia</i>. What we see when Mullen's language calls attention 
        to the racial and gendered exchanges of color and clothing is a scene 
        in which the representation of black femininity serves as a pictorially 
        visible but ideologically hidden support for the lavish displays of white 
        femininity offered up for exchange in the sexual and aesthetic marketplace. 
        Mullen draws from the adornments, innovations, and disruptions of her 
        modernist women predecessors in order to expose the lying ways of this 
        seemingly naked truth. </font></p>
