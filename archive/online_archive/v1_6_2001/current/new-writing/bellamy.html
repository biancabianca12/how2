style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">�Cunt-Ups� is based on cut-ups, in the classic 
        Burroughs sense, as delineated in <i>The Job.</i> I used a variety of 
        texts written by myself and others. Per Burroughs� rather vague instructions, 
        I cut each page of this material into four squares. For each Cunt-Up I 
        chose two or three squares from my own source text, and one or two from 
        the other sources. I taped the new Frankenstein page together, typed it 
        into my computer and then reworked the material. My interest here was 
        in creating a disembodied, shredded sexuality.</font></span>

        don�t think it will be battles between your cunt, I�m slurping it, I�m 
        smearing, you know this from your writing. I�ve reached the nipple now, 
        I�m so fucking behind, I�m sorry. I�m sticking my tongue between and I 
        hope this doesn�t sound trite, thinking that you fucking me is your imitating 
        lifeforms, and my arm, my fingers are really tentacles to perceive more 
        clearly, this is the same path on my body right now. I�m thinking that 
        somehow I�m whispering in your ear. In general you were fingering me rather 
        than fucking me, it�s the wilderness we�re used to seeing in you. Is it 
        okay that I can�t see the whole picture yet? Layers. It gets dark with 
        its blood and tensions, and you encounter a sphere with your hands. Kiss 
        its head and run your lips along something other than a line, I�m moving 
        from tootsie roll hard to zucchini hard to something extra, something 
        other than a square. The idea of fucking as strangers�is this woman ready? 
        I dunno, I�m just getting to it, it�s like I read your thoughts, smell 
        you, know the answer to that, and I definitely hold it wide open. It took 
        a long time to come to this secret knowledge, the whole time thinking 
        of you pulling me specifically, biting my nipples a bit just to remind 
        me. I think my pussy was all yours, wanting to meet your brass zipper 
        teeth. I�ve been here, I�d almost pushed them all out, down in anti-gravity. 
        My thoughts sail clean out of my asshole, they dipped so that you�re like 
        Thanksgiving forever. You gave me a shot and my belly button opened, then 
        you left and I had one big cunt in the middle of my forehead, lay down 
        on my bed left to dream. I keep wailing your name like a siren. I�m out 
        of the leather, falling asleep, it still looks like a snake�s. I�ve had 
        the fem swastika, or those other ancients, I�m just letting it rest there, 
        petting it a bit. In a small house in the field, fucking you later. I�ve 
        never been fisted. Adjust my dirty panties before you licked me. Anything. 
        Around 1990 I spurted, finally, I�m your throbbing pussy savior. You thought 
        I would wait for my spit on your nipples, right? I�ve taken a house, the 
        one with the brass disks I stuck up your asshole. I�ve wanted too many 
        messages, I turned, wanted to touch you forever. Just know the living 
        with lots of flags hanging, put your arms around me, rub your jimmy in 
        my mouth as I�ve described. I walked in circles, there for a few seconds, 
        your tongue swirls my left boot, the one I�d traveled with. Know me. Keep 
        me. Kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss me, here on the sidewalk somewhere north 
        of Gold.</font></span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Large cows fed me sacredly, this occurred after you cut 
        up my body. The orchestra played, phones rang while I jerked off, thinking 
        of you covertly in the woods behind my house. It was you calling me.� 
        I don�t really know what you wanted, but it�s our cock now, no alternative. 
        Will you give it to me in little pieces, scattered and kind of sweaty 
        so I can taste the salt? Can I pull down my pants and push it gently through 
        your skin, my tongue in your ear for just a second, discharge like a small 
        river? Can I take the knife my father gave me and peel your scrotum into 
        an ancient parchment? Can we do this in Florida for approximately one 
        year? Can I slide the knife gently down your belly? Giving your cock much 
        attention, I read it. Can you see me kneeling there on the floor nostalgic 
        for our past and filled with desire <i>fuck me with your teeth</i> one 
        hand on each of your thighs, computer, ripping your shirt open, tugging 
        homicides, licking the honey from the tip of your cock? I really do want 
        to fuck the shit out of you, Fuck Bug. I�m vain like that, excuse me: 
        fuck me. I�m sliding. Dear Three-Headed Cock. Dear True Walls. I�ll stick 
        your cock stone inside my cunt whether or not you consume my pussy like 
        hot wax. Do you like it? I still want to swallow you whole, to consume 
        any body parts, all that roughness across something smooth, you with my 
        tongues, and I hold you with biceps, do you see me, I look up at you and 
        wink with my licking. I think I might pass out. Do you still want me to 
        cover your face with rose buds? I think of you fucking me undercover. 
        Do you want me to come all over you, squirrels and stones stuck to our 
        skin?� I thought so. It�s the middle of the day so I don�t pass out. Does 
        your pussy weep like a waterfall? I�m going to push it together and when 
        your clit gets hard I�ll lick one nipple and then I�ll lick the other, 
        I�m going to slide right in between your lips and work my disposal to 
        its heights. Then you rubbed your nipple to blow out the fire. Regarding 
        the head, how to open and close it like a door, like the day I�m kissing 
        you for a really long time, about 25 years, you are lying on your back 
        so we both have the same breath. I perform actions with you, there�s a 
        storm outside and lots of people will know your cock moving in and out 
        of my mouth, and then you begin placing body parts in it. So much.� I 
        used to have brains but now my tongue moves aback and forth along you, 
        they�re in my mouth and I�m licking you and you touch me without sleeping 
        pills, I�m creaming for you through my panties, your jimmy like topsoil 
        under my last breath.� I�m licking you in the bathtub, you are dismembered 
        and there�s a lot of come.� It feels like a movie with the soundtrack 
        turned off. And you keep pressing up against me, want me to piss all over 
        your spine, clawing. Then we�re running down the street naked together 
        because we know how heady death is, you pass out and I�m getting wet not 
        speaking any English so we fucked and so my cock is red hard and all the 
        little people are drowning in red, and as I was saying, I love you. My 
        belly breaks open with light. I�m saying all these things to you in the 
        basement, I give you some more coffee and spell out F-U-C-K M-E with my 
        hands. I�m sitting here and after you fall asleep I strangle you again, 
        this is what I really want to give you for your birthday, I�m fucking 
        you, I�m sliding my greasy cock into you the usual way. Then I boil your 
        head. We are on. My cock, I think it wants to go camping.</span> </font>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The first time my cock bloomed into you I got manic. 
        Lying on you I saw birds flying and they brought with them the rough wash 
        cloth, it felt so good. I drew giant pictures of demons with crayons, 
        took a pair of cotton bikini panties and walked five miles barefoot in 
        the middle of the bed wearing nothing but these panties. I was having 
        trouble feeling you up my cunt all the time, I watched myself turn into 
        a snake in the damp spot on the front of your pants. I bang the mirror 
        with my fists, and the glass shatters to kiss your face and your mouth. 
        I want to lick books and read them that way. I could turn you really small 
        and put you in my chest. I was a corn snake gliding through words, but 
        more than that I purged my life, time to drag yours through the hospital. 
        I wear you like a cashmere coat, three pieces of you are poking out/in 
        me. In so many ways. I watched my father scorch the center of the island 
        and I have to tell you you�re a whore. I shot my father into the earth. 
        I want to fuck your cunt for a thousand paces, in a twenty foot room, 
        into the earth. I want to fuck your cunt in the ceiling. I reached for 
        the guard�s keys to fuck you again, and it�s today. I want to poke my 
        gun in your ass until it jiggles through to the other side. I want you 
        to fuck me from behind, to look out to the water together, stitches in 
        my butt. I want to hold your cock at its dark. You banged on my fucking 
        door, like a heart. The aching in my lips to round its head like I�m praying, 
        it came nine times, pumps out my throat and into an adverb. That would 
        be breezes and spots. I pinched my nipples, meaningless language. I feel 
        like I�d just like to lay, pinching them in a semi-public place, I feel 
        like I�m melting, I have to hold on to this plan of making friends with 
        your cock. I�m sucking, close to you again. I feel so luxurious, you in 
        my panties as if I hadn�t read Anais Nin. Like a big stalk of seaweed 
        bobbing about my pussy against the computer screen. I put pistols in my 
        hands, lime-green colored, and I reach down and unravel my wrinkled long 
        distances. I felt this swirl rush though me, it�s a map. I realize you 
        haven�t been breathing into me, I�m a dead man and I get lost in it, the 
        mixture, you�re ready to cook my head like a goat�s. And then I�m with 
        you again, right now, here on the floor, my cock goes up when I read this. 
        I got so aroused at your pants, snarling, �Give it to me.� I flop around 
        the bed like a beached whale. I shouldn�t take that beautiful word fuck 
        in vain, I�m using your cock for leverage, but I can�t really get in, 
        I throb along your lips in your office with your pants still on. I hope 
        so because I want you to fuck me. I still have sleeping pills too. I hurl 
        my body though I still want to swallow your hole. I surround you, every 
        minute, with tongues, and I love you, running my tongues along your fucking 
        Redwood, I just want to sit here with nipples, they must be really light 
        pink and so solid that a freight train couldn�t knock them. We�re both 
        flatter than the dead with my cock swimming in your cunt, I was seconds 
        away from slamming.</span> </font>
