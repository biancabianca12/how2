<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">2. This footprint is taken 
from a plate in my college Fine Arts 1A class. A Greek temple to Zeus, the plan 
is described as “peripteral,” which in Greek means “flying around,” from the root<i> 
peri,</i> “feather, wing.” In this print, the colonnades mark off the interior 
sacred space with a permeable wall, a sanctuary surrounded by bars.</font>
