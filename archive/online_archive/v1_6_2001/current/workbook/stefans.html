        <br>
        The poem's words are always interrupting my activities of daily living. 
        Like when I'm buying cigarettes, walking the dog, waiting to be fitted 
        for my NASA costumes, browsing the stacks of major metropolitan libraries, 
        shopping for underwear on 14th Street, reading the instructions for my 
        paraffin hand softening mitts, reading poems, overhearing conversations-- 
        just being out and about and the poem starts to get written into notes 
        in my head. But the final version of 'writing a poem' comes really with 
        the public reading of it, then I know it's really been written.<br>

        <br>
        I'm always in living conflict around a reading as I'm working out problems 
        of the text in conjunction to that particular reading. I have a background 
        in theater, so I tend to go for the dramatic, but no full body waxes. 
        I'm also really frustrated with how formal and dull the presentation of 
        experimental poetry can get even though the work is so exciting. The work 
        usually can't show its full potential in a dull reading, unless the intention 
        is to be dull, and that's always interesting. I'm glad poets are starting 
        to think more about presentation and how to get the work across in all 
        forms. I'm not talking costumes by Bob Mackie, but just a subtle intonation, 
        or speeded-up passage, or pause, or sigh, or fumbling. I've been interested 
        in how to speak texts not necessarily meant for orality since way back. 
        Maybe since I first heard the Torah read aloud...<br>
        <br>
        For my Senior Thesis in college, I "performed" Roland Barthes' essay, 
        Steak and Chips, a text not meant to be heard aloud. I worked very closely 
        'choreographing" the language. For a while in the late 80's I worked with 
        a choreographer Amy White and we used found texts and made performances 
        from these olds books like "The Use of Electricity in the Home" and such. 
        A few years ago, Sally Silvers & I wrote a collaboration "Orphan Deposit 
        Box" and worked out how to perform that together. She's a friggin' genius.... 
        and she and Bruce Andrews really rock when they put text and movement 
        together or not together as often is the case. I like that texts can be 
        scrims or oncoming freight trains, or whatever you want them to be. They 
        can be all that they can be. <br>
        <br>
        I think I'm just naturally making my writing more performative as I go.<br>
        <br>
        For my performance with Dirk Rowntree (former Debris drummer, graphic 
        designer, photographer, art maven) at Double Happiness Dirk and I started 
        preparing months in advance by drinking martinis at Minetta Tavern. We 
        then talked about what constituted the usual factors of a poetry reading, 
        and how we really were bored by that. We talked about the space and materials, 
        packaging, PR, and not really wanting to do the old "Can everyone in the 
        back hear me? Ahem. Tap Tap Tap" on the microphone kind of thing. So it's 
        natural that being audible wasn't that important, in fact I wanted people 
        to be able to go in and out of the text, as if they were falling asleep 
        at the opera, which is a beautiful way to hear things sometimes. <br>
        <br>
        I also passed out product info. and beauty tip sheets before the reading 
        to welcome everyone personally to the bar. I was trying to get non poet 
        bar patrons to stay as well and have this kind of Moonie inclusivity as 
        these scenes are so, you know, the opposite. They were really excited 
        to be included in whatever was going on. I agree with Nada Gorden when 
        she says that poets should have party favors at readings or something 
        like that. I think we should have merchandising that includes, mugs, pens, 
        banners, t-shirts, and perfume samples. I wish we had funding to make 
        all this possible. For me a reading is really like a bringing together 
        of everything, like a wedding. It's a BIG AFFAIR minus the caterer, but 
        you've got to think about the invites and guest list, the gown, dinner, 
        and dancing all the time. That kind of thinking of the whole- of- it creates 
        a necessary ambiance for me in my reading work (Question #<a href="http://www.arras.net/truth_interview/questions/question_9.htm" target="print9" onClick="window.open('http://www.arras.net/truth_interview/questions/question_9.htm','print9','resizable=yes,toolbar=no,scrollbars=no,menubar=no,width=300,height=300')">9</a>). 
        The lists in my poems are just ways to glue it all together, which is 
        fundamentally, what technology can do for us. And we need technology to 
        seal-in fresh culture. Otherwise we do get a little scanty and bottled 
        up about the pro-em. <br>

        <br>
        Are you referring to the poem Sarafem? I don't know which poem you mean, 
        but those aspects exist in all my poems (objective vs. societal views 
        of self). Pasting the poem into Vogue magazine was more organizational 
        at first, but then it became important to me how the poems looked on the 
        pages and how it changed the meaning of the intentions of each page. It 
        also helped with pacing during the reading as I had to find the poems 
        during the reading, so I got to play a little hide-and-seek with myself 
        which became my activity while Dirk was playing "emulsion guitar" with 
        Kodak film strips. My nose also was really running, so I had a whole Kleenex 
        using that people thought was meant to look like I was a Cokehead.<br>
        <br>
        That was the practical side of using a fashion mag for the reading, but 
        obviously I'm acutely aware of how the language of beauty and perfection 
        under the guise of guidance marks and reformulates culture. Beware of 
        anyone offering solutions is really what I mean. Science can work in much 
        the same way. Both genders are affected by fashion although women are 
        more targeted and men are more part of the fallout.<br>
        <br>
        I don't think consciously of writing for a specifically female audience 
        but am very much concerned with the portrayal of women throughout history 
        then and now-- the now part being my bordering obsession with popular 
        media and culture. This all comes through in my work. I've had a few good 
        men tell me "Excelsior Reflector" (in <i>Good Morning-- Midnight--</i> 
        Roof Books) appeals more to women but I'm not even sure what they mean. 
        Because there's a mini fashion show in it? I don't know. Frankly, men 
        rule the fashion world, look at Tom Ford, Calvin Klein, YSL, but there 
        I go again...<br>

        we all are ontologically insecure, not just women. I hope the critique 
        of this is pan-gendered, pan-cultural, and pan-historical, not just limited 
        to the French babes of the Nouvelle Vague, although I love that period 
        in film and am so happy that look is coming back!<br>
        <br>
        My work raises issues women and feminism chronically have to contend with 
        but I do hope also that it isn't delineated solely by those struggles 
        and can be absorbed or connected to on other levels also. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Don't Forget:</b> (Question # <a href="http://www.arras.net/truth_interview/questions/question_4.htm" target="print4" onClick="window.open('http://www.arras.net/truth_interview/questions/question_4.htm','print4','resizable=yes,toolbar=no,scrollbars=no,menubar=no,width=300,height=270')">4</a>)<br>
        <br>
        I think Americans are obsessed with getting "the truth" out of people 
        or catching them in their own truth. It's the Temptation Islanding of 
        the Real World. Surveillance, web cams-- the more technological we become, 
        the more we want to share our "truth." It's very odd. I think that's the 
        latent content of the "soothing but mischievous" style you must be responding 
        to when I read. <br>
        <br>
        I hope this quality doesn't come through when I'm with my clients, I'd 
        be out of business! Or maybe I'd be rich! I think the world operates on 
        the polarity of soothing yet mischievous, and has historically for some 
        time. Look at Ronald Reagan and the Iran Contra scandal. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Carry-On Comfort:</b> (Question # <a href="http://www.arras.net/truth_interview/questions/question_5.htm" target="print5" onClick="window.open('http://www.arras.net/truth_interview/questions/question_5.htm','print5','resizable=yes,toolbar=no,scrollbars=no,menubar=no,width=300,height=170')">5</a>)<br>
        <br>
        When I'm writing a poem, I don't have to comfort or soothe or watch what 
        I say or wonder what impact what I've said has on someone, or maintain 
        professional ethics and standards as I must in my therapy work. In writing 
        I become my own therapist in relation to being a therapist and don't always 
        have to have one eye on the wheel and one eye on the road (Eugene Gendlin) 
        or something like that. Maybe I'm even more like my therapist's therapist's 
        therapist or more like therapist's software. But making poems for me operates 
        in this Cubist or prismatic seeing everything at once or a little of something 
        for the moment world the way therapy sessions can too.<br>

        I don't see Language writing as aggressive or impersonal. I actually find

        don't given the frame I have to work with. Honest. Just a little quiet

        In the last 5 years poets seem to be dressing a little better.<br>
        <br>
        I think all the new web technology is really interesting for poets. It 
        forces us to have to do a little more PR on ourselves and think more in 
        terms of product. The poem begins to take on a more flexible role and 
        that is really good. I can't wait until I have time to figure out what's 
        up with all the boys who are really heavily into their cyber life, and 
        that includes you, my dear.<br>
