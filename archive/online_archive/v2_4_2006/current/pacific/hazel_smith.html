class="at150spaceStandardText">I have been rethinking the idea of elegy<br />        in the afterglow of William Watkin&rsquo;s book <em>On Mourning</em> <br />        it has been throwing out some new threads for me <br />        though sorting them is like TV surfing <br />        I have been wondering whether poetry will rebirth<br />        now that it is moribund <br />        and why I like to write multimodal poems <br />        and I have been brooding over the geographical scattering <br />        of my deceased friends tightly packed together <br />        in the technicolour menagerie of my head <br />        and whether memorials are for the silent or the living </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">I have been questioning if there is <br />        mileage in still being a poet<br />        or if by now I should be a novelist <br />        because everything is a terminus from which you depart <br />        and I have been wrestling with<br />        the western model of emotion as spontaneous feeling <br />        which is the cultural roadblock of our times <br />        and thinking of Hilary and how I must keep her memory alive<br />        I have been experiencing this as an urgent responsibility<br />        so pressing it has been difficult for me to undertake<br />        and I have been cogitating about <br />        whether I can hold death in a way <br />        which calms it before it kicks me over <br />        time is running out </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">each day I think about the difference between poetry and prose <br />  there often doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any <br />        only the line which has a limited life-span<br />        and (as William says) often refuses to lie down </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Derrida implied that he never came to terms with mortality <br />        though he found words in which to talk of it <br />        nothing takes the route it seeks <br />        history is always popping pills <br />        and even the fates spin to the erratic <br />        rhythm of the remote control <br />        I thought I would write a poem about Hilary <br />        in metaphors which would shoot themselves up <br />        first they couldn&rsquo;t find the vein <br />        then they overdosed </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">She cried &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll leave all that behind&rsquo;<br />        but the average life span of a book is tiny<br />        Arthur Miller thought that bequeathing a trail <br />        was the most telling experience you could have</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">but it has to beckon to someone <br />        (usually its your progeny)<br />        maybe I will have a great-great-great niece <br />        who will be passionate about poetry <br />        or curious about her heritage<br />        or just interested in herself <br />        she will dust off my volume <em>The Erotics of Geography</em> <br />        and reinvent it as an Australian classic<br />        a beacon of multimodal writing<br />        an example of migratory ambivalence <br />        or maybe she will simply read it<br />        or someone else will <br />        unrequested, unrelated</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">I wonder why some people <br />        prefer my on-the-page works <br />        to the off-the-page ones<br />        seems phobic almost perverse<br />        it never fails to surprise me<br />        how the poem stalls and stalls <br />        and then suddenly starts up like a freshly-tuned car<br />        I have been craving for so long for mobility <br />        and suddenly it zooms forward <br />        a whirligig amongst the tottering hi-rise<br />        a joyride through the hallucinogenic oblique <br />        so many times I had thought of trashing <br />        that stand-alone file on my computer<br />        now caught up with others<br />        in a knees-up of poetic sociality</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">every time I saw Hilary <br />        she added more weft to the warp<br />        I don&rsquo;t want to cram her into a story <br />        William says that death forms <br />        the outer limit of containment, categories and definition <br />        yet it is also powerful and precise <br />        the bull&rsquo;s eye of destiny<br />        though I am never in the centre when it hits <br />        if it&rsquo;s happening in Australia you can be sure I am in England <br />        if it&rsquo;s happening in England you can be sure I am in Australia <br />        I always miss out on the big day<br />        perhaps even my own <br />        which like all unpleasant but unavoidable appointments <br />        I will need to prepare for though I do not know how <br />        I must check first that Hilary is mentioned <br />        in the major reference tomes on weaving <br />        that Rory&rsquo;s book is on the road<br />        that Kate&rsquo;s photos are pasted up in albums <br />        and then make a note of it in my diary</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <p

You need to change the wind direction. You need a touch of ventriloquism. You need to visit a place that is not expecting you, and doesn&rsquo;t even know you exist. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Writing! Why are you always over the water, out of my reach? </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">My heritage, though you may not realise it, is tantalisingly mixed. I have a few loose ends in Lithuania. But I&rsquo;ve never travelled there, and couldn&rsquo;t find my way around if I did. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">She sank into a void where they only spoke an alien tongue. She could not follow the street signs, or go to work, or shop. So she starved and took to lying in bed, and waited for the end. But then, as death came debt-collecting, the foreign terms jumped out of her mouth. They tumbled down the stairs like unexpected guests. She was saved but had known she would be: it was the same as when she wrote. She couldn&rsquo;t, and she couldn&rsquo;t, and she couldn&rsquo;t, and she couldn&rsquo;t, and then suddenly she always found she could. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">The translator sits at his table, turning over cards. He does not know the rules of the game, but can invent whatever he likes. He can choose any card that takes his fancy or chase cards from other packs. He can load the dice, refuse his turn, or show his hand to history. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">A good poem is untranslatable, it depends on how one language needs to speak. In this way, poetry lags behind music, which says everything and nothing, usually in the same endurance-testing breath. Next to music, poetry is a little heavy, a little debased, a little awkward. But while music comes clean about this, poetry pretends it has definitive things to say. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Visitors from several countries came to him one night, dressed in brightly coloured rags. They danced for him and after that they started to undress. He said, I don&rsquo;t want you naked, but please try on each other&rsquo;s clothes. Don&rsquo;t be shy or fearful! Chose colours that you don&rsquo;t particularly like, don&rsquo;t feel you have to mate and match. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">So they all took off their rags and exchanged, and exchanged, and exchanged. They kept it up till dawn, when they decided to depart. Everyone left fully dressed, but no one claimed the clothes they owned. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">An ambassador came to meet me with a large hat and pointy shoes. He was on a world-wide promotional tour. He said, I am sure we can come to an agreement, and it is this: you will use <em>our</em> words in <em>your</em> country, then you can travel free in ours. I said, get lost, you unctuous imperialist, don&rsquo;t make me laugh. We aren&rsquo;t that short of cash, you know. <em>It&rsquo;s not just words, it&rsquo;s everything they carry with them</em>. He got up and quietly left. You can deal with these people easily, by throwing language back in their laps. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">One day when I am old, I will lose my memory. It will be like a field with nothing in it, or strewn with too much junk. I will look at one object and then another, and I won&rsquo;t know how they interrelate. But the past will flow downstream while poetry tends its pitch. And maybe I will wake one day and find I can speak Chinese. </p>      <p align="right"><a href="#">(back to top)</a></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <hr />      <p align="justify" class="makeSingleSpacedBiog"><strong>Hazel Smith</strong> is a Senior Research Fellow in the School of Creative Communication, University of Canberra, and a member of the Sonic Communications Research Group.
