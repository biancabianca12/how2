She has performed her one- woman show, also called <em>Wild Dogs Under My Skirt</em>, since 2002 around New Zealand, in American Samoa, Germany, Austria, Russia and Hawai&rsquo;i. Tusiata was the 2005 Fulbright-Creative New Zealand Pacific Writer in Residence at the University of Hawai&rsquo;i. She has just been short-listed for the Prize in Modern Letters, the world&rsquo;s biggest literary prize for emerging writers (worth $65,000).
