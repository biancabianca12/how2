If literary history is to be written it must create a textual environment in which poetry thrives. Poetry has long functioned as a litmus test for language&mdash;look at the OED, Century Dictionary, or the Webster&rsquo;s Dictionaries that were actually written by Noah Webster&mdash;to see poetry used to define by example in almost every single etymology. If poetry functions in part as a litmus test for what weight words can bear, then the book should function ecologically, as the weather or discourse. Whatever the case, it is always at least possible to make any poetry&rsquo;s action the subject of a book&rsquo;s form. </p>  <p>Chapbooks are the aesthetic back bone of small press poetry and as such in America we get no money. Because this country doesn&rsquo;t want to systematically support detail work, time to reflect, or the care and feeding of intellection, this country systematically does not support artists&mdash;especially &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; artists (smallest profit margin). So one must find a benefactor. Stick your thumb in a pie and see what comes up.</p>  <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr class="quoteText">      <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>      <td width="80%" nowrap="nowrap"><div align="left">[Litmus test says&hellip;.

For their work I am so grateful. Until this past year, I had not concerned myself with press money often. Now, however, I have three great books in queue and I must stop to fund raise. </p>  <p>Chapbooks run along a continuum from pamphlet to artist book. The aesthetic of the artist book leans more toward what I begin to articulate in the first paragraph. The aesthetic of the pamphlet is desperation. By desperation, I mean the aesthetic of the pamphlet reflects the very conditions of experimental poetry. Often in actuality this reflects two things: a lack of funding and a desire to get out a maximum amount of work because there is more work being written than the available page space for making contact. I have tried to make handwritten press run somewhere up the middle&mdash;maximum book-beauty for least cost and quickest output.</p>  <p>From the beginning handwritten press has largely operated as a gift economy. First, because we can always only afford to make 100, we want to get the books to people we think will appreciate them. In this way, an editor can act as a conduit between readers, communities, and other presses. Whoever is involved in collaborating on a book&rsquo;s production contributes to trying to get them to the best readers we know of. Yet the question always nags: what about great readers we don&rsquo;t know? what about future readers? Second, larger bookstores and distributors regularly throw away and-or destroy what doesn&rsquo;t sell by a certain period of time. If you send your books to libraries, both personal and poetry-centered ones, they will be preserved and freely distributed for as long as they can hold up. This model invites subversion by resisting shopping at multinational corporate bookstores. It also oddly inverts the usual sales model in that the maker chooses the &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; (reader) rather than the other way around. </p>  <p>I named my press handwritten press, thinking of handwriting as a kindred material factor that the literary establishment regularly devalues and/or erases from literary history (SEE: Emily Dickinson). In January 1999 handwritten press put out its first two books, <em>Morning Constitutional</em> by Michael Magee and <em>Project Experience: Museums, Monuments and Archives</em> by Joshua Schuster. I knew both poets through the Writers House. To this day, I really only publish people who I know, and who are un- (or severely under-) published. This stems from my commitment to make each book a collaborative and formal extension of that book&rsquo;s content. Perhaps it is a shortcoming of mine, but I can only accomplish this with someone I feel I can get regular, personal access to, so that we can meet, discuss, play, and go paper shopping together often. The making of each book has been a series of immediate, intuitive adventures punctuated by lucky finds. But even more than that, getting to know the person who wrote it is part of making the book. In trying to materially manifest poetry in book form, a bookmaker becomes the student of the poet. It is a great opportunity for close reading. For many readers, as we become more and more intimate with a particular text, it enters our dreams and fill a portion of our vision. The forms of many handwritten press books (but not all) have come in whole or in part as a vision or a dream. I feel committed to the work inside so I try to make something our recipients will feel compelled to look into, that will feel necessary in the hand. The book helps the poetry invite the reader to play, to experience the mystery and surprise of writing.</p></div><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->        <div align="left"></div>      <hr />      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="section index" -->      <div align="left"><a href="index.html">Forum Index</a></div>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->      <p align="left"><a href="../index.htm">Table of Contents</a></p>      <hr />      <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../media/navbar.swf" />          <param name="quality" value="high" />          <embed src="../../media/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    </div></td>  </tr></table></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
