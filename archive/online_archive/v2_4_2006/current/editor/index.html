Things tend to know themselves better than humans, who are simply other &ldquo;things.&rdquo; The prepositional words used to position them, to pin them down, in turn become meaningless or even misleading. Is pan-perspectival the best word to convey this lack of a human-centered epistemological view?</span></div></td>          <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>        </tr>      </table>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Zhang Er&rsquo;s spatially smart term &lsquo;pan-perspectival&rsquo; is a tough counter to the tendencies of mainstream media to homogenise culture, familiarise the strange, and stifle ideas that threaten in their difference.&nbsp; It is perhaps the task of transcultural internet communities to resist the wholesale export and influence of totalising logics, such as the violent consumerism propelling each of various war machines that are raging globally, and instead, to keep filamentine track of sites in which &ldquo;everything is open to everything else&rdquo;.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">This issue of <em>How2</em> &mdash; one localised voyage into geospace &mdash; is my last as editor.&nbsp; I am especially pleased we can include an unpublished interview with the inimitable and much-loved Barbara Guest alongside several articles and a memory bank celebrating Guest&rsquo;s legacy.&nbsp; I am also delighted to have chosen the thematically disparate poems in &lsquo;Outer Alphabet: <em>26</em>&rsquo; entirely from unsolicited submissions.&nbsp; Such an open geospatial sweep is a momentary gauge of the journal&rsquo;s reach, and suggests both the hope and eclectic necessity of <em>How2</em>&rsquo;s project: countless different women continue to identify with <em>How2</em> as a forum for innovation, outspokenness, experiment and community.&nbsp; Spatiality and placement emerge as core concerns for many poets in &lsquo;Outer Alphabet&rsquo;.&nbsp; During an era in which struggles to control ontological and ecological space are paramount, and bloody disputes for cultural territory have become the substance of daily public spectacle, this trend in critical thought is both inevitable and politically welcome.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Over the past six years I have worked closely on eight issues of <em>How2</em>.&nbsp; Special features on Gertrude Stein, Rosmarie Waldrop, Maggie O&rsquo;Sullivan, Genevieve Taggard, Leslie Scalapino, Nicole Brossard, Alice Duer Miller, Joan Jonas, and the poetics of collaboration are just a few great memories of that time.&nbsp; Our translations broadened in scope to publish pioneer work from Italy, contemporary and modernist Japan, France and China.&nbsp; Echoing shifting tides, our &lsquo;mixed media&rsquo; focus assumed &lsquo;new media&rsquo; dimensions and showcased work from the U.K., Brazil, North America, Canada and Australia.&nbsp; I have been inspired constantly by the quality and concentration of poems, papers and reviews I&rsquo;ve had the honour to read.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">It has been a rare treat to edit <em>How2</em> and to make friends with a stellar crew of co-editors, poets and artists along the way.&nbsp; Working with Redell Olsen and John Sparrow has been terrific and I thank them while looking forward with excitement to Redell&rsquo;s editorship.&nbsp; <em>How2</em> moved in 2005 to a single home at the Piper Centre at Arizona State University and adopted a simple new web-address.&nbsp; The journal had been resident since 1999 in two different places, with our archives at Rutgers University and the journal at Bucknell University under the guidance of Roberta Sims.&nbsp; Last year&rsquo;s evolutions and transitions were thrilling and timely.&nbsp; They were accomplished thanks to the hard work of many people including John, Cynthia Hogue, Kathleen Fraser, Robert Hampson at Royal Holloway in London, and the Piper Centre team.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s expertise has allowed an elegant redesign of the <em>HOW(ever)</em> and <em>How2 </em><strong><a href="http://www.how2journal.com/archive" target="_blank">archives</a></strong> &mdash; please visit them!&nbsp; I would also like to thank Roberta and Ann Vickery, with whom I worked in detail on earlier issues, and <em>How2</em>&rsquo;s Editoral Advisory Board, particularly Kathleen, Cynthia, Susan Schultz, Sawako Nakayasu and Jeanne Heuving, who have been especially helpful during my time as editor.&nbsp; Thank you to the dozens of guest editors and hundreds of contributors who have made this job a labour of true love and surprise.&nbsp; And most importantly, a hugely appreciative thanks to <em>How2</em>&rsquo;s scores of dedicated readers.&nbsp; Poetry and imagination are in your hands.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Kate Fagan</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Sydney, July 2006</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <hr />      <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>          <td width="43%"><p align="left"><img src="../home_images/fagan.jpg" width="180" height="249" /></p>              <p align="left">&nbsp;</p></td>          <td width="57%"><p align="left"><strong>Editor:</strong><br />        Kate Fagan<br />        <span class="style1">kfag6311[at]mail[dot]usyd[dot]edu[dot]au</span></p>              <p align="left">&nbsp;</p></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><p align="left"><img src="../home_images/dell-photo2006.jpg" alt="Redell Olsen" width="215" height="235" /></p>              <p align="left">&nbsp;</p></td>          <td><p align="left"><strong>Managing Editor:</strong><br />        Redell Olsen<br />        <span class="style1">redellolsen[at]btinternet[dot]com</span></p>              <p align="left">&nbsp;</p></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><div align="left"><img src="../home_images/sparrow.jpg" width="215" height="325" /></div></td>          <td><div align="left"><strong>Webmaster:</strong><br />        John Sparrow <br />        <span class="style1">john[dot]d[dot]sparrow[at]gmail[dot]com</span></div></td>        </tr>      </table>      <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"><span class="TITLE2">HOW2 Internet Address (Bookmark it!):</span><br />          <a href="http://www.how2journal.com">http://www.how2journal.com</a></p>      <p align="left"> </p>      <p align="left"><span class="TITLE2">Editorial correspondence may be e-mailed to:</span><br />          <span class="style1">kfag6311[at]mail[dot]usyd[dot]edu[dot]au</span></p>      <p align="left"> </p>      <p align="left"><span class="TITLE2">Review copies of recent books may be sent to:</span><br />  Kate Fagan <br />  26 Iredale street <br />  Newtown, NSW 2042<br />  Australia</p>      <p align="left"><a href="../../authors.htm" target="_parent">Masthead</a> (Editors &amp;
