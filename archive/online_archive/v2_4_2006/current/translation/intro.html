The world will never know. Thanks to <em>How2</em>, we have a sample of poems written by contemporary Chinese female poets born in the 60s and 70s, telling us about themselves and their lives. In this age of an increasingly crowded global village, their lives share remarkable similarities with our lives in the West. </p>  <p align="justify">Yet, despite the contemporary scenes and refreshingly self-assured female voice in this work, the poetics of these poets reach deep into the long tradition of Chinese poetry. The poetics represented here fundamentally embrace the system of understanding underlined by the Chinese metaphysical concept of &ldquo;Heaven and Human are one&rdquo; &mdash; which denies separation of the subject and the object. True knowledge, in this respect, can&rsquo;t be determined, given that mind and matter are the same, and observer and observed are one. Such knowledge is fluid and multi-directional in time and space. The human is not the only active participant in the game of knowledge. &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; is more powerful, more knowing and more ubiquitous. Yet &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; does not equal &ldquo;God/gods&rdquo; in the Western sense. &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; entails the universe and the reasoning that embraces us all &mdash; and is part of things. </p>  <p align="justify">The apparent lack of syntactical structure and the non-directional collages of image and action often found in Chinese poetry, including the work collected here, derive from the requirement of such metaphysical understanding. Ezra Pound instinctively picked up on this feature of classical Chinese poetry, and brought it to the West as a new technique to enrich its poetic artillery without realizing the philosophical significance or the distinct difference of the Chinese definition of &ldquo;things.&rdquo; He was ingenious in attributing this feature to the Chinese writing system and its pictographic aspect &mdash; which lead him to invent imagism. Yet he still missed the metaphysical point at the bottom of it all&hellip; &ldquo;No ideas but in things&rdquo; demonstrates just how narrowly William Carlos Williams and some imagists construed, and missed, the essence of Eastern thinking. </p>  <p align="justify">The difficulty of translation created by such writing is significant. Translators, who are often poets not unfamiliar with imagism or other post-Poundian multi-perspective writing strategies, are nevertheless perplexed by the seemingly arbitrary usage of personal pronouns in many Chinese poets&rsquo; work &mdash; as well as the fluid shifting of perspectives, the animation of things without any warning, and the tenseless transition of events defying a linear timeline, even when the poem is telling a story or following an obvious plot. If nature and human are one, the subjective and objective are one, mind is matter, and the conception of the world is not a human-centered activity, then the lack of &ldquo;I&rdquo; in many Chinese poets&rsquo; work becomes perfectly understandable. The absence of &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the manifestation of a presence everywhere, by every thing. Things have mind, or rather things ARE mind &mdash; or in Williams&rsquo; term, ideas are things. Animation is therefore unnecessary.</p>  <p align="justify">These writers&rsquo; poems sometimes have the quality of dialogues between interchangeable partners. Everything in a poem, I mean everything, is fluid: there is no fixed reference frame. Everything is open to everything else. &ldquo;I&rdquo; turns into you, he, she, it, we, they, etc. Time and space are &ldquo;things&rdquo; as well as other abstract thoughts and concepts. Things tend to know themselves better than humans, who are simply other &ldquo;things.&rdquo; The prepositional words used to position them, to pin them down, in turn become meaningless or even misleading. Is pan-perspectival the best word to convey this lack of a human-centered epistemological view?</p>  <p align="justify">On the other hand, like other Indo-European languages, English is a phonetic language (i.e. it records the human voice to name things), and therefore it assumes a human perspective and human-centered knowledge. The foundation for such knowledge is the philosophical separation of mind and matter, of subjective and objective. Readers need to keep in mind that the translators have to make some brave adjustments in English, in order to re-create the energetic fluidity of the internal and external world where these Chinese poets dwell. </p>  <p align="justify">Incidentally, <em>Wings</em> is a poetry journal in Beijing devoted to the work of female poets. Many poets selected for this issue of <em>How2</em> had been published in <em>Wings</em> before. Notice the plural in the translated name, which is added to satisfy the logically conditioned mind. Of course it has to be a pair, male and female, Eastern and Western, for the take-off of an adventure. More works of these poets and of their male counterparts will be collected in the <em>Talisman Anthology of Contemporary Chinese Poetry</em> (ed. by Zhang Er and Chen Dongdong, Talisman House Publishers, New Jersey), which is forthcoming later this fall.</p>  <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>      <td width="75%">&nbsp;</td>      <td width="25%" nowrap="nowrap"><div align="left">Zhang Er<br />  Olympia, WA<br />  Feb. 17, 2006</div></td>    </tr>  </table>  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>  <hr />  <p align="justify" class="TITLE2">Biographical Information: Poets &amp; Translators</p>  <p align="justify"><strong>Poets:</strong></p>  <p align="justify" class="makeSingleSpacedBiog"><strong>Cao Shuying</strong> was born in Nov. 1979 in Ha&rsquo;erbin of Heilongjiang Province.
