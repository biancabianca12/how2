The destination&rsquo;s <br />    unknown: one often meets his sober introspection; <br />    he puts his best foot forward, already knowing <br />    the cost of his travels: what guides him is <br />    an imagined freedom that promptly stops beckoning, <br />    its bargain: mind drills. He gives the hawker </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">his ferry boat fare. This paragraph requires a path <br />    enriched with imagining; first he seeks out <br />    a seat for his self. Facts of his being on the road needn&rsquo;t<br />    be handed over like those of the official in a picaresque <br />    novel, narrated by an ant army and read by saliva, <br />    knot woven into culture and history by the printing press. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">Setting down his drab briefcase, <br />    he shifts his gaze outside the window. His new <br />    p.o.v. replaces the double-sized scorched fantasy photos. <br />    Like a painter who yearns to be a robot, <br />    he&rsquo;d rather be a speeding camcorder, <br />    discarding a smudged post-Expressionist oil painting.</p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText"><strong>2.</strong></p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">Please imagine a machine&rsquo;s relaxed mood. <br />    Death, which alters appearances, wields <br />    fragmentary limbs and body, but each part <br />    represents the whole, says, &ldquo;If it only <br />    listens attentively to death, my entire life <br />    is not life, but suffering.&rdquo; Harboring his cautious </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">dread, he returns to people: Li Ke Long&rsquo;s second floor <br />    resembles a weary dyspeptic stomach, <br />    directly across from Shuang An Department Store, <br />    where one pair of huge kids cut from paper emit<br />    intermittent mutters distorted by car horns. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">Cross the street; skywalk the stiff underside of a dog&rsquo;s belly, <br />    the road cut up in paperbacks; open the back cover to offer <br />    sacrifices to the blue-clothed god who reads, analyzes, drafts<br />    anew a complete oeuvre on human behavior in ten moralizing <br />    commandments. He thinks his mood is Dante&rsquo;s <br />    entering the forest, as he steps into the exclusive minibus. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText"><strong>3.</strong></p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">&ldquo;We ourselves become lines of poetry written by books&hellip;&rdquo; <br />  Case in point: at this section of road, we&rsquo;re unable to locate <br />    the imagined components of narrative, a plot. <br />    Alone, the minibus&rsquo;s lyrical rhythm can&rsquo;t lull the post- <br />    industrial masses. He endures his fleeting nature at the bus- <br />    stop, as if it were a self-indulgent fever. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">Bus stops: Taiping Zhuang, Nonglin Ju, Madian, Jing&rsquo;an Zhuang: <br />  they&rsquo;re either the city&rsquo;s mosquitoes or fluttering characters <br />  in the midst of a crowd&rsquo;s raucousness; yet this silk brush <br />    might as well stop him from using women around him <br />    to bear the complicated experience of the gaze. He, Mr. Zhang San, <br />    an ordinary man, is possessed of some natural rights. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">&ldquo;Among women, who is most fond of shopping where: Qiancun Department <br />  Store, Instec, or the Lufthansa Center?&rdquo; You can only guess <br />  by the clothing&hellip; his darling wife stays at home, and she knows <br />  her women&rsquo;s hobbies; one among these women was in love with traitor <br />  Yu Yongze; his arrest stems from his dear gluttonous wife&rsquo;s hobby.</p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText"><strong>4.</strong></p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">Parcel of pig liver and confidential Party materials, love or <br />    revolutionary enterprise, <br />    these are antitheses in the books he&rsquo;s read; <br />    the question he has no time for allegorized <br />    by passengers getting on and off in turn: &ldquo;Those who want to get on, get on; <br />    if it&rsquo;s your stop, say something&rdquo;&mdash;history&rsquo;s meaning <br />    found in excessive annotations of ordinary speech. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">But why must his identity be made clear? <br />    Why does the author not want to discover something about him he cannot find? <br />    He takes a calculator from his briefcase, checks <br />    how much his business has earned. <br />    His youth is promising; is his seat on the minibus<br />    nothing more than a mark of the nouveau riche? </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">&ldquo;Will have bread, will have everything.&rdquo; He admires <br />    the Marlboro pressed between his fingers, distinguished emblem <br />    of two esteemed cultures, characters: Act! Victory lies ahead! Yet he <br />    identifies himself with the cigarette: &ldquo;I am being burned <br />    to the utmost degree by my own flame <br />    and curl up in my own smoke.&rdquo; </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText"><strong>5.</strong></p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">&ldquo;She left home beneath a cloud.&rdquo; <br />  Now he can&rsquo;t not remember his old love; <br />  this boring era couldn&rsquo;t propagate <br />    the complex desires of postcoloniality: not missing a beat, <br />    Private Second Class Wang Er brings back the past,<br />    like a cigarette&rsquo;s anger and depression; <br />    now elsewhere, she plays the lover&rsquo;s role. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">At that time they were thought happily earnest (which, according <br />  to some definitions means &ldquo;sincere&rdquo;); it&rsquo;s all been done <br />    before: romance, jealousy, self-pity, hateful eyes, the begging, <br />    giving up no more than indifference with verbs and adjectives&mdash; <br />    the emotions they manipulate, keywords of an adolescent thesis. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">But always the body first summons wisdom, <br />  prolegomenon of phenomena&rsquo;s ultimate proposition, <br />  inferior to imagination&rsquo;s pleasures as it arrives at the other shore. <br />    Sublimated to her form, however blurred, he draws <br />    the support of a few images: is one woman not all <br />    women? But is he himself? </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText"><strong>6.</strong></p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">He savors abstract rain water in the concrete wind: <br />&ldquo;If oceans are doomed to break dams, then let <br />the bitter waters empty into my heart.&rdquo; <br />    In an instant, he sees his hand holding a spear;<br />    he charges the enemy position, <br />    this old incompetent swerves with astonishing speed, <br />    his misconceived Terminator screams sweeping past <br />    the small hotel and food stalls beside the road. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">He stretches. &ldquo;Our sleep, our hunger.&rdquo; The corner turns, <br />  he gallops outside God&rsquo;s reasoned commandments, the field of civil rule <br />    colored lights that wind around branches, like ads on public billboards <br />    lining up to guard the country&rsquo;s great festivals.<br />    &ldquo;The world related to me, oh!&rdquo; <br />      But who, based on his immaculate dress, gleans his classical <br />      view of the whole world? Odysseus is finally returning home. </p>  <p class="at150spaceStandardText">Getting along in years, nearing death in a scenic poem, <br />    Mr. Zhang San gets off at Nongzhan Guan, changes buses,<br />    jumps on another minibus; <br />    after half an hour, the mousy-haired missus opens the many-locked door <br />    and greets him&mdash;the color of the sky darkened long ago, maze of asphalt <br />    debauched with red lanterns, green wine; <br />    in the next poem he encounters M&eacute;phistoph&eacute;l&egrave;s, but for now <br />    he shakes off the glare of three lights at the intersection, following <br />    me as I trudge into <br />    night&rsquo;s dim territory.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->        <div align="left"></div>      <hr />      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="section index" -->      <div align="left"><a href="index.html">Translation Index</a></div>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->      <p align="left"><a href="../index.htm">Table of Contents</a></p>      <hr />      <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../media/navbar.swf" />          <param name="quality" value="high" />          <embed src="../../media/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    </div></td>  </tr></table></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
