Their ruffed blowsy metal mid-bloom in their stillness. No need then for an elaborate off stage wind contraption modeled on the bladders of geese, or to hire a goose chorus, or to trap one goose in a padded clamber to study its digestion to watch ice and breadlumps flee down its gullet to shelter in its ruinous liver. To cut apart the limb of bread and spread its ripped organs. No rich-rich communion on or off the stage. RITUAL DIRECTIONS: no ritual. No need to climb to the top of the jade pyramidal icesculpture, don white tie, wait for the peons to escape catastrophe and ring our goosy necks, which we&rsquo;ve wrapped in white as if to beg the sacrifice. We&rsquo;re not that guilty yet. Just silent. No need to prepare the photographic plate. For a thunder appartaud tucked into the rafters as in the tarp of an upsidedown junk moving down the stilly river. Like its own still moonlit reflection. The current like black snakes. Beside the canisters of light. Or real snakes. No puppy to be killed by the costumed soldiers out of their right minds. BOMB DIRECTION: no sound. STORM DIRECTION: no storm. SOUND DIRECTION: A hem of noise as from an offstage sea or factory. The audience worries about their role in this, aware of their derivation. Of their extraction from all they could possibly hear. Pulse here as if seated between their own ears. Lite hum from an desert-side factory employing the unluckiest women. They are the lady matadors of death, their only protections their breasts and soft bodies. And hold piteously small needles. And make a wristing motion that contains a whole sea. DESERT DIRECTION: a flat bed walled with two-by-fours as in a hayride. Sprinkled with rosy quarters and rose quartz, but it should open like a folio: hinged. A treasurebox, it may be stored closed. Off stage, for now. As in NOW DIRECTION: now. DEVIL DIRECTION: no devil. PHONOGRAPH TREES: a gilded matte fluorescence. All shell. You could crack one and thereon the light would flow. At the top of eight foot poles, four or five horns like manmade marigolds. Like swollen trumpets. LENGTHS: of medical tubing snake like vines from their utmost. BECAUSE: these are outmoded, defunct trees which grow only on our special aisle. DEMONS: There is a prescriptive strumpet-demon called Lamia not mentioned in this play. She&rsquo;s a slander on the gender and the race. GENDER DIRECTIVE: what is the gender of this play. There is honeydew which is the cross-bred food of paradise. It is fruit and milk, and it may have sprung up from the sprocketing phosphorescence. The glowweed maps its migration, how it floated here and miscegenated the set. Sex by moonlight, old rub off the genet lamp. The food of paradise is mixed up all ready. It&rsquo;s predisgested and glistens in the bag which is a </p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">HONEYMOON:</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">two yellowjackets nose on and noise violently. They dip and twirl in a beautiful symmetry and coil off like unspooling thread Bit off the needle of the maquiladora. Black striped maquillage. These figures represent Plague, Fate&rsquo;s Closure, the closing of the Evening Bag, and the conspiring of circumstance. Invisible on the stage except for the long stiff plastic threads they swing stiffly from. These may glint. However, their whine may be heard now near now far by those seated in the gallery, by exertion of the small speakers with which each person is fitted in exchange for a ticket: a bland cardboard box on a noose around the neck.</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">THE HONEYMOON&rsquo;s OVER:</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">Harumph. Caboose after a few final flicks of the needle the thread is torn away. The audience returns attention to the stage to see the limits of a surf-length train just pulling out of sight and into the curtain. Applause. This again echoes the surf. The audience begins to wonder: Are we under the surf ourselves? Do we play the seabed? As this thought simultaneously courses through every soul in the seat, a wave begins. Member after member turns his palms up into it, but this wave is silent. This is only the representation of the sound. Lowering his arms, his palms find each other and clap again. This the sound. This number continues until it exhausts itself. The wave stills. Now a murmur is born among the audience. This murmur becomes a chatter.</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">END OF ACT ONE:</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">The audience files out like the tide from an inlet, shaking their heads like hairs on the head of a god. As he shakes foam from his mustashio, the whitecaps flex. They flood the lobby. At the flash of lights and a crack of thunder in the lobby (for here is where the special effects shall be mounted) they file back in. Back in the seacave, the first tide of an empty hem of plastic cups where the first layer of liquor has been drunk. It drapes a cherry sea. The mirror behind the bar multiplies the predicament. The barmaid in her awkward vest stands in the seam of two oceans, unlucky nymph. She sighs and brings up a platter round as the emptiness of fate. She begins knocking the empty cups away. In the silent lobby. Track lit with globe after globe of light.</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">BACK IN THE THEATER:</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">The audience back in their seats, turn to the stage expectantly. The tide of their hairpieces and rolling eyes. Their monocles. Their cat lenses. Their feathertrimmed sleeves and capes. Their dead stoles. Their shoes which are a tide of leathers. Their cows. Their mythic herds under the seas. A tide of mice let in to bounce against the arches and insteps run about the laces. Knees scissor up in aghastment. Tide of screams. Between two gramaphone trees, a moon of cheese is precipitously lowered til it hangs two feet from the ground. A yellow moon-beam manque gangplank dribbles over the stage, jumps the stagelip and lowers into the audience. The mice run up this and make a leap for the milky galleon. There is a rush like lost breath towards the attention point of the moon as all of the mice are removed to it. The weight of the mice sinks the cheese into a groove in the floor which hastily seals over.</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">EXEUNT MICE:</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">Watching all their air run out through the puncture point of the moon, the audience has been holding its breath. Now when the moon drops they gasp and find the gallery fat with oxygen. They breathe in through their noses at once then breathe out in a phhht. A merest hint of pink surfaces on the backdrop of the theatre. They suck in and breathe out again. The margin spreads. It is as if they are inflating a daytime. Applause. Pink lights up.</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">ENTER GIRLA:</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">Girla is skinny. Her hair is skinny and black flat. She wears flats. Her skin is pale Chicana. She is from Chicaga where she keeps aflat. Where she keeps a tide of schoolbooks stacked flat, their frank binding. Though she has long since left school She wears a little shimmy skirt and a turtle nect. And she wears an audience-speaker on a lariat around her neck.</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">GIRLA: (purring, with eyes closed, to audience).

Anything of labor drained off long ago betwen the grotting of the factory floor. The cracks envining the walls, the walls invining. The inviting moisture finding a place to collect and go mordant. The lungs inflowering at it. Hunched at the whirring machines became organic a matter of flounce or flight. The factory chamber wide and empty as a thought bubble.

We were girls together and splashed our silver in the silvery inlets. Our jokes were as good as gold and we got rich off it, typing them into our internet site. Someone melted us down for a platter. (platters appear in a halo around the rock). Harrows, harrows. I am old as the barrows where Plecthra threw down her rocks. That&rsquo;s a made up story. It was the one god all along. (he strikes the rock with his bound fist. a tide of mice runs out and appears to run right for the audience. the audience screams or sighs. as they reach the lip of the stage, the mice come up against a plexiglas lip. Thud, thud, wave after wave of mice hits the lip and they pile up. Another lip comes from behind and seals them in. A belt conveys them off as if by sushi robot.)

She sits down on its flat bottom and switches on the screen as a viscous pale lake spreads from the downturned mouth of the bucket to the holes of a hidden drain. The perfectly round face of a casual suburban gangster, Buddy Slew, fills up nearly the whole screen with its playdough pockets. He is heavily caked in white, the moon as a man made up for vaudeville. If a crater were a magnifying glass, it would expose a gently curving continent of hunched towns of lending libraries. Countless autodidacts scurry home under thick books stacked in columns that swerve perilously as stacks of genes, their sweatered spines crook&rsquo;d like the houses folding and spindling the hills. Their glasses coke bottled. For vaudeville is a studied form, without naturals. What you take for inspiration is learned, learned, learned. All Buddy Slew&rsquo;s reactions have the cognitive delay of early movies or mime, as if the middle term had been dropped out and the thought had to swing from frame to frame on a ropeswing or vine. His eyebrows are as heavily exerted as apostrophes or a rescue squad, and may be thought&rsquo;s landing sites.</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="../home_images/spacer.gif" width="45" height="5" />Into the screen waves the neck and mouthpiece of a clarinet; he waggles his thick eyebrows, purses his mincy mouth, and tootles it; beat; and then the patter of gunshots like gravel hitting the street. He wands it away with a wink. Next the heel of a well-stacked hoagie drifts on. He makes a delighted bathtub in the center of his face, then takes a big bite. Sound of fists landing in steak. He drains the bathtub to a pin and raises his eyebrows to the edges of his vista&mdash; now grins and it drops away. He chews like a train. He lifts up a fat cigar already smoking; a waved-on match &lsquo;lights&rsquo; it; he puffs; the &lsquo;ugh&rsquo; of someone grabbing his shot-up gut and slumping butt first to the curb. Finally, a cardboard bullet swings into the frame and hits him in the eye; a siren; he yanks it out; the siren drives by. He sighs and smiles, wags his eyebrows as if to reassure a party full of anxious children: all fine! A polkadot hanky mopes his brow. He composes himself. He looks over GIRLA&rsquo;s shoulder at the audience, mimes gurgling and popping like a baby or a spring. A slender stream of fake gunshots like a bundle of mimosa runs till it runs out. The image shrinks to a coin-sized disk that rings his right eye. The screen winks off.</p>  <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">GIRLA: (drumming her fingers like a smoker on her thigh.) I love that Buddy Slew. Does every fucking thing the animals do, and thinks better. It starts and ends with him, he&rsquo;s the limit. He&rsquo;s totally complete. His own microcosm and the same everyweek. The same network. That test pattern of him checking all his ports and drives like you run your hands over your last leg looking for the bite. Where&rsquo;s the bite, where&rsquo;s the bite, where&rsquo;s the itching coming from. This swelling did I have it yesterday. If this swelling changes to its inverse and the entire limb decays, will he love me anyway. How could he be expected to desire me when I don&rsquo;t even want myself. Well, everyman loves a throwaway. If you&rsquo;re so non-sustainable, use it up yourself. (This whole speech is thought). OK? (She says aloud like the chief just briefed the gang. She picks herself up, goes to the edge of the stage, grabs a plain metal folding chair from the wings, and unfolds it back on stage, facing the audience but canted towards the center. She crosses her legs and her arms.) OK.<br />  </p>  <p align="left"> <span class="doublespaceStandardText"><br />    SOUND DIRECTION: The tickertackering of a reel-to-reel projector.
