We all understand that the story begins before and carries on after? Blank spaces and gaps and parts that are incomprehensible and simple things that disguise mysteries or pretend to. Riddling. </p>  <p align="justify">Lots of white space standing in for score upon score upon score of black letter. Pages destined to be skipped. Thousands of pages not enough. Name/born/died on a tombstone &ndash; call it a book cover &ndash; giving insufficient idea, except in the saddest of cases, of the lived space (turning through the pages). </p>  <p align="justify">The sequence once laid down is inalterable. If born, you die. Episodes in the middle have an accidental quality even though, once they have happened, they are &ndash; in a fluttery way &ndash; fixed. What must have come before and what must follow will expand or constrain; may recap or foretell. As blurry as it is opaque. Impossible to restore a sense of discoherence to a double page spread. Page over can there be a surprise?</p>  <p align="justify">I make a book of my mother to acknowledge her weight and the gravity with which I treat my memories. Reconciling at the same time that I get my own back. The book is short &ndash; terse &ndash; to acknowledge that the task is impossible. Easy to flick through the pages. I use spiral binding so the open book can lie flat. It is not too fanciful to say that the wire sutures the glaring pages; uglifies the flow. </p>  <p align="justify">I can neither read nor write mother. But I can imagine before history and early years and later fears &ndash; from what she told me and from what I observed and from what has been true for me. I cannot reconstruct or forgive her tedious creep into living death followed by dead death, so I think myself forward, thinking what I would wish if it were me. And at the moment I understand fully that the book is not an image or a page &ndash; that, held in the hand, it has a weight &ndash; I perceive that the weight is light. Have I made her life in the book or mine? May the answer bear fruit.</p>  <p align="center" class="style1"><a name="images" id="images"></a>Click images to enlarge</p>  <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">    <tr>      <td width="33%"><div align="center"><a href="#images"><img src="images/jacobs/a_medea_tn.jpg" alt="Click image to enlarge" width="250" height="136" border="0" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('jacobspop1.html','jacobs1','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=800,height=610')" /></a></div></td>      <td width="34%"><div align="center"><a href="#images"><img src="images/jacobs/b_refrain_tn.jpg" alt="Click image to enlarge" width="250" height="257" border="0" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('jacobspop2.html','jacobs2','scrollbars=0,resizable=yes,width=568,height=584')" /></a></div></td>      <td width="33%"><div align="center"><a href="#images"><img src="images/jacobs/c_lace_tn.jpg" alt="Click image to enlarge" width="250" height="121" border="0" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('jacobspop3.html','jacobs3','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,height=610')" /></a></div></td>    </tr>  </table>  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <hr />  <p class="makeSingleSpacedBiog"><strong>Sarah Jacobs</strong> is a sculptor.
