Whether this is biologically 'essential' or just straightforward like when you left the toaster burning or because women have a subordinated relationship to power in their guts I don't know. Is this clear enough for you to follow. I don't know. When I say we should try not to forget the author, this is because that would be bad manners as well as ridiculous. When I say there is a centre into which exclusion bends I mean <em>nothing</em>. When I hear you ask how much money did you get or how far have you got into your work, something internal plunges for the exit, like puking, it wants to get out - because you're <em>still</em> being hostile (after all these years) - &amp; look toward the charcoaled meats for rescue. There they are still on fire.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>When I read your attempts at Latin &amp; 'cum' &amp; humour I think: no one cares about you after 1 a.m. &amp;: it's so exhausting, &amp;: did your father(s) never tell you to &quot;stop showing off to people.&quot; Were you never crushed &amp; leant on by another? I guess that's why my weariness comes from &amp; distends. Or perhaps it's just obvious bad manners. When I get excited because I think, why should I hide the fact? Does that mean I have loose morals or absence (social awareness) or cool. I will pretend from now on. When I lose heart because there are too too many I's for my liking, &amp; you won't write to me these days because you say I lost heart too many times, &amp; that's ridiculous, but OK, because you're <em>still</em> hostile after all these years that are still there smouldering.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Whenever I write <em>you</em> it blends &amp; morphs into so many others. That's what comes from being informal I guess. Or not cool. Or erotic. When I get respite from absence, when I think about SPACE - annihilating all that's made... I don't know about presence (metaphysically), I never felt any. When that's all corrupt-ridiculous, a dream-trampling, I hear that Glasgow's a satellite of Cambridge, I laugh &amp; puke &amp; think how nice to be a lesbian putting on plays by Olsen. When I watch films with '70s headscarves on heroes like they were the good old days. (But free love comes at a price, at least the cost of one or two burnt fingers). Our mothers learnt that for us amongst nothing.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The SPACE allowed around each satellite, you want to crush it &amp; plunge into an abyss of your own name, obviously-shaped through the light, even though self-naming is a fault &amp; way too semantic. Whenever you talk the people salivate; others write &quot;pretentious bullshit&quot; in the margins, underscored &amp; overlined with envy or malice or maybe just obvious good sense. The pockets are full of stones. When people hear you talk they think: you've got a way with yourself - or: if it were me I'd run - or: words. Or: way too erotic. When I say lips like chances are the keys to all surface like a true domestic animal, you should see into my room, I haven't vacuumed in days. There is almost no SPACE left.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>What elements are in the vowel-sounds of your mouth, too recent like carbon rings. Anyone can tell the interrogative is a style like any other (apron). I'm wondering about nursing &amp; cooking &amp; following you round, wiping the saliva from your tongue. That body more prompted like recent words dressed up in a foul mouth that wonders about illuminating gaps: no money, real work or outlets, just an object which heeds, a verb without status. Daughter's inconsequence unloosed on a whole crowd of informals to no (obvious) purpose.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><a name="1" id="1"></a>That uninhibited experience told the time &amp; your temperature without difficulty. There was no object to my supposing, but a verb with no status. when you told me to take it any way I wanted, I took it in the best sense possible. I guess that wasn't what you meant me to do. No object, no money, &amp; no outlets. Woman's a floating island round an imperfectly-baked dessert. In an oven you get burnt. Is this too obvious are you getting warm or even angry. This isn't metaphorical, I mean it to be <em>true statements</em>, shook up like inside hurt. However you decide to take them. Do I look like I'm joking when I tell you that &quot;The meaning of certainty is getting burned.&quot; <a href="#end1" class="footnote">[1]</a> </p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>I once said you were the emery board to my fantasy, the CO2 to my fire. In late adolescence you were pushed forward, they said your will was &quot;atypical.&quot; I knew the main points. Implicit in all this was a fatal altering, in spite of rigour, succinct but weighed on. It was helpful to take a little series of pills in place of you. Set down precedence of mighty but unsure chemical reliance. Elements not scheduled. Arisen not meeting. A flame who plunged into defunct night help me to float down shaken but deserving no less than everything.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The hostile space around each name beckons. I would long to work on soundly besides. Who plunged into the night. At that time deserving no less than everything. Finally, I come to visit you with your slow gaze &amp; deliberate blindsight. Your hair which was always fine is streaked with grey &amp; adequate silence. No adapting, just a process unravelling itself soundly here in other people's minds. But they say nothing can grow beneath greatness anyway - the pastoral typifies - nothing can not get burnt. Anything shades up to difference or gradates nicely. I have not reached this stage for nothing. But not even now, completely wilful. <em>When I say women don't need men for anything I mean it</em> not even a way of flirting.</p>  </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a name="end1" id="end1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> (Rosmarie Waldrop, <em>Lawn of Excluded Middle</em>, 18) <a href="#1">(back to text)</a></p></div><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->        <div align="left"></div>      <hr />      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="section index" -->      <div align="left">        <p><a href="critchley_index.html">Back to Emily Critchley</a> </p>        <p><a href="index.html">Back to London Calling Feature</a></p>      </div>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->      <p align="left"><a href="../index.htm">Table of Contents</a></p>      <hr />      <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../media/navbar.swf" />          <param name="quality" value="high" />          <embed src="../../media/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    </div></td>  </tr></table></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
