By negative sexuality, I mean the lack of place or space for alternative sexualities, or even for a lack of sexuality, within a culture of compulsory heterosexuality. I was interested in what happened when one faces that which is found to be repulsive and in exploring what occurs in the subsequent turning away from that which is apparently abject. I have tried to create a meshing together of language which is taken from the film, reviews and from my own commentaries. &ldquo;p u l s i o n&rdquo; offers a reflection on the representation of the taboos of sexuality in order to expose the clash of disgust and desire.</p>        </div></td>    </tr>  </table>  <p><span class="at150spaceStandardText"><a href="robinson_pulsion.html"><strong>Enter <em>p u l s i o n</em></strong></a></span></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p align="right">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <hr />  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class="TITLE2"><a name="where" id="where"></a><a href="robinson_woodbine.html" class="makeGreyLink">w h e r e t h e w o o d b i n e t w i n e t h</a></p>  <table width="100%"  border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">    <tr>      <td width="250" valign="top"><p><a href="robinson_woodbine.html"><img src="images/robinson/woodbine_tn.jpg" alt="w h e r e t h e w o o d b i n e t w i n e t h " width="250" height="250" border="0" /></a></p></td>      <td><p align="justify" class="at150spaceStandardText">This project uses image and cut-up lines of found material, as well as hair and blood to create collages that are my initial attempts at creating a poetics of disgust. The start of this project was finding an article in Marie Claire magazine entitled &lsquo;The Men Who Have Sex with Dolls&rsquo;. I also found two 1960s science-fiction television programmes that seemed related: an episode of The Twilight Zone called &lsquo;I Sing the Body Electric&rsquo; (a misappropriation of Walt Whitman&rsquo;s poem of the same name), and an episode of <em>The Alfred Hitchcock Hour</em> called &lsquo;Where the Woodbine Twineth&rsquo;, about a girl and a doll who become each other.</p>        <p align="justify" class="at150spaceStandardText">In an attempt to created new relationships between the materials I took sections of text from all of these materials and cut them into strips. I created collages of text and images on Photoshop. I then ran the initial source materials through an online freeform permutation machine. I wanted to further fragment the permutated body of the text and create a language which at once reflected my source material and also used the language of technology to turn against itself.</p>        </td>    </tr>  </table>  <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText"><a href="robinson_woodbine.html"><strong>Enter <em>w h e r e t h e w o o d b i n e t w i n e t h</em></strong></a></p>  <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="right" class="standardText">(<a href="#">back to top</a>)</p>  <p align="justify" class="standardText">&nbsp;</p>  <hr />  <p align="justify" class="makeSingleSpacedBiog"><strong>Sophie Robinson</strong> was born in 1985.
