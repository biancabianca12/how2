My boiling hands<br />      and blood except from sun not from error<br />      not from accident. Pelvis raised from its<br />      flat board (mon amour).

Eliminating the poles one by one. <br />      They lift their jets they are so<br />      the touch of wood, the smelt of blood on it<br />      has earth with it, keeps earth open to sensation. These<br />      are soapy trials, pushed about in gloom the disappearing juts<br />      of buildings, the tolerated coolness<br />      the unbidding ship. Wilderness. And the ship topples<br />      in its glassy box. Keep under control<br />      the more sensible urges. Padded like locking down<br />      for the rest of the year, body hearth. This all caged together,<br />      no but I am actually serious, by the need invested in me<br />      the troops of daisies and other symbols of plenty. Turbid <br />      noise and everlasting return. How noiselessly provided for<br />      are the roses garnished in my flesh which turn and liquefy.<br />      How do you cope now<br />      with decay, else by biting down heavily. I feel so slowly hunted,<br />      lashings of formula stretching over me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center">-----&lsquo;&rsquo;------</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is certainly one way to do it. I would tolerate anything<br />      for the spit to be opened. To fashion for myself from wheels<br />      the skills listed, or hunt about accumulating a feel for numbers.<br />      Let me think. No. Death is for sleepers<br />      the peel and slide of their tubed bones over water<br />      the lovers we mutate into. Peaches made of pens. Rubber made<br />      of wire. The latter contingency circling out.<br />      <img src="images/spacer.gif" width="220" height="5" />I really loved it. It was a fiction<br />      charged with literacy.
