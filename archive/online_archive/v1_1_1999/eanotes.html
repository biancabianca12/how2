He had alreadycovered a few pages when I arrived and in a short while looked at me,passed on the work to my hands and said that I surely would like to workthe way he did, and that the book was mine  <u>to continue </u>.  It was clarly amystic transfer, a gesture in the logic of Being, something that came froma place preceding him and that had to go, to keep going, to acquire a newtransiency, an open-ended trust.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I came home, unfolded the book and looked at my own brushesand inks, I thought that I had to do some drawings the way I knew.  I drew,I remember, a Chinese ginger vase that I had, then a flower pot with someflowers, then my own inkpot...so different from Rick's drawings!<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that new format started to preoccupy my mind: I had to dosomething I never did, to find a way of thinking adequate--for me--to thisnew material.  I realized how much materials, for artists, are things thatmediate thought, how much they condition one's aesthetic choices, how muchthey become the elements of one's expression, and instead of being just asupport, they become in a way a  <u>co-author </u> of one's work.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know I'm telling a story, but story is always superior to theory,albeit theory is. . . another story.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Things happen in time, therefore they always constitute story: theunfolding of one's mental operations is akin, it appeared to me, to theselong horizontal scrolls that are not meant to be grasped in a single visionlike a painting, but rather  <u>to be read </u>, visually, in sequence, like anordinary book that you cannot read in a single glance.<br><br><img SRC="ea2.gif" HEIGHT="154" WIDTH="324"><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This sense of reading attached to the very format of these&quot;scrolls&quot; brought to my mind poetry and literature. I felt that kinshipbetween script and the horizontality of the paper, I suddenly saw that Iwas going to write poetry on these papers and paint watercolors with thesentences, verses, or words.  I opened up to myself, with exhiliration, anew artistic world whose possibilities I was going to explore by the veryacts of painting.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I used Arabic poems: Arabic script has in its essence infinitepossibilities, and of course they have been explored and practicallyexhausted by classical calligraphy and by the geometric patterns made ofsacred verses, and turned into clay tiles which ornament the great mosquesof the Islamic world.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My endeavor has nothing to do directly with this classical heritagewhich is based on the codifications of script and on the perfection ofcodified brush strokes.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I used my (extremely imperfect) handwriting, figuring out thevisual possibilities of the manipulation of letters and words given theelasticity of Arabic script.  To give an example: a single letter can be asshort as the tiniest possible script or can be extended to cover a wholepage or, by extension, any size possible or imagined.<br><br><img SRC="ea3.gif" HEIGHT="148" WIDTH="324"><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was more than just interested in this new approach, I was havingthe feeling that there was something sacred about it:  I felt close to theicon painters of the past: they were in awe of the fact that they weredealing with sacred history, I was dealing with the combination of poetry,script and painting, I was finding a way out from the past (classicalcalligraphy), and still carrying on to new shores the inherentpossibilities of Arabic writing:  I was discovering, by experiencing it,that writing and drawing were one.  So, the watercolors or ink drawings andthe writing of the poetry were constantly unified in the visual field ofthe art work.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This approach, which combines literature and art and which has beenfundamental to Chinese and Japanese art, and which is transformed here,seems to bring out a sense of becoming, of fluidity, of constanttransformation, as being essential to the mind:  the mind never rests onthese scrolls as it moves back and forth on them as a scanner.  Thisexperience transforms those visual, written words, and the paintings ofwhich they are a part, into a kind of musical score that each person,including their maker, translates into his/her inner language, orlanguages, into that which we call the understanding.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Working for years in this direction led me to the suspicion thatour mental world is an on ongoing &quot;translation,&quot; that perception is atranslating of the object of that perception, and that any thought that wemay think to be primordial, spontaneous, is already an interpretation ofsomething which precedes it and may even be of another nature, another&quot;stuff&quot; than thinking itself, a wavelength, an &quot;it&quot; which remains unknown,a translation of this &quot;it&quot; by an active filtering function we call the&quot;mind.&quot;<br><br><nobr><img SRC="ea4.gif" HEIGHT="129" WIDTH="270"> &nbsp;  <img SRC="ea5.gif" HEIGHT="125" WIDTH="270"></nobr><hr>Excerpted, by permission of the author, from &quot;The Unfolding of an Artist'sBook.&quot; <u>Discourse</u>, 20. 1&amp;2. 1998<br>Ink drawings by Etel Adnan, photographed by Trinh T.
