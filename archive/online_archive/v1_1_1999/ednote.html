This conference brought together an extraordinary international       roster of English-language poets and scholars making forays into a range       of exploratory writing practices, and it included a great deal of thinking       about the innovative character of poetry in its contemporary guises. I was       struck immediately by the well-balanced distribution of women and men--on       the theoretical panels as well as the evening poetry readings of new work--and       what a radical shift this gender equation marked in the public community       of literary conversation. <br>      <br>      But I also noticed an all too familiar and disturbing phenomenon: that very       often, after the formal papers had been delivered and the audience debate       engaged, the proportion of women's voices took a nose-dive; these same voices       were seldom heard from in the impromptu exchange of opinion and difference.       A predictable dynamic played itself out: the same handful of adept individuals       would address a speaker with an aggressive challenge and soon the discussion       would be taken in the direction of the challenger's agenda. Still, one felt       the silence was &quot;pregnant&quot; with alternatives that were not being voiced       and could not find critical mass with sufficient speed to sieze the public       moment and possess it. <br>      <br>      This phenomenon had been remarked upon for years among the women writers       I knew, and would often repeat itself after that conference; but, on that       occasion of sincerely staged equality, it seemed more glaring. Clearly,       the renegade women poets were still not all that adept at improvising divergent       or conflicting thoughts aloud in the face of practiced &quot;authority.&quot; Since       the early Eighties, we'd begun moving into the publishing world with fuller       representation as writers and editors, but we still had serious work to       do in assuming our share of choosing and shaping the dialogue focused on       what and how we read.<br>      <br>      . <br>      <br>      Clearly, more practice is needed. But maybe it's also that the acceptable       language and model of discourse used in the public critical arena is too       narrowly cast...stuck in the repeating grooves of a worn record. The problem       might lie not only in learning to speak the existing foreign language, but       in finding more registers and vernaculars in which to speak it. These continue       to be the questions and urgencies that have determined the desire to create       HOW2 as the next stage of HOW(ever).<br>      <br>      . <br>      <br>      <a name="jaffer">It</a> is in the spirit of the original print journal that       HOW2's technological shift--and its focus on reading/s of texts--is dedicated       to the San Francisco poet, Frances Jaffer--an originating co-founder of       HOW(ever)--who died on January 20 at age 76, after a long and debilitating       struggle with rheumatoid arthritis and its complications. Jaffer was a poet       and a trained scientist whose non-stop curiosity, philosophic imperative       and political readiness to claim parity combined to make her a poet/friend/warrior       extraordinaire. Jaffer published two intriguing chapbooks and one substantial       and brilliant collection of poems during her life, and was engaged with       questioning and re-making the poem's body...even after her hands could no       longer manage the keyboard. When her fingers wouldn't function, she used       pencil erasers for pecking out e-mail and getting down rough drafts of poems.       Some of these last poems and a very recent essay on H.D.--dictated, sentence       by sentence, to a graduate student last spring--may be found in the pages       of this journal. You will also find her uneasy thoughts on the predicament       of feminist/experimentalist women poets--as we found ourselves in 1983--in       the first issue of HOW(ever) V. I, n.1, soon available through the Rutgers       University Libraries electronic archive (see below). .<br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      The need for HOW2 had been perking in my mind for at least a year (the &quot;perking&quot;       stage reinforced by my novice, slightly phobic relationship to technology),       when Kathleen Crown--at that time working on her Ph.D, and the moving force       behind the &quot;Poetry in the Public Sphere&quot; conference at Rutgers--engaged       me in an e-mail correspondence. This exchange soon revealed my desire to       reinvent HOW(ever) as an electronic journal, with an expanded international       network potential; the question of an appropriate suppport system and web       site address was still being thought through. <br>      <br>      Crown suggested that there might be a potential for this project at Rutgers       and quickly moved to put together a meeting of PPS associates with representatives       from Women's Studies, the Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities       and the Rutgers libraries, to seek funding and technological support for       the new journal and the HOW(ever) Archive of the original twenty-four print       editions (May 1983-January 1992). This project was given the go-ahead and       a year of immensely time-consuming labor--some of it financially supported       and much of it volunteered, as in the work of Miriam Bartha whose significant       and thoughtful expertise was entirely uncompensated. The HOW(ever) project       went forward with HTML translation of archival texts completed this winter.       Primary to achieving this archival completion were Kathleen Crown and Miriam       Bartha (PPS); Delphine Khanna and Erin Griffith (SCC/CETH); Stan Friedman,       Designer; Theresa Duhon, Proofreader; Marianne DeKoven and Harriet Davidson,       Women's Studies advisors; and librarians Peter Graham, Greg Murphy (SCC/CETH),       Harriette Hemmasi and Jeanne E. Boyle who facilitated the archival emplacement       at various stages. Through a complex and cooperative use of funding and       personnel resources at Rutgers, HOW(ever) will very soon be available for       scholarly research and the initial design and production of the first issue       of HOW2 achieved. For this fantastic labor of love, the entire HOW(ever)       project is deeply grateful. <br>      <br>      Taking up the electronic torch for the second lap, Bucknell University--through       the timely proposal of Cynthia Hogue, Director of the Stadler Poetry Center--will       provide technical support for subsequent issues and, beginning with this       first number, will serve as the electronic home for the new HOW2. Webmaster       Roberta Sims will oversee tech production. Our special thanks to Nancy Dagle,       Assoc. Director of the Bucknell library, for facilitating this project and       its cooperative link with Rutgers. <br>      <br>      . <br>      <br>      A final thought: <br>      <br>      HOW(ever) filled an original need for identifying and publishing a hybrid       group of women poets experimenting with syntactic and formal approaches       to the poem and claiming the modernist women writers--mostly erased from       active canon approval and availability--as their foremost family of choice.       What we needed in 1983, more than the assertion of manifesto-certainty,       was a place in which to make informed choices and to register them publicly       through the intuitive yet exacting selection process that made a journal       WE wanted to read. We chose poems that shifted the mind's assumptions and       the ear's clamor for habit. We were &quot;odd ducks&quot; who didn't fit the existing       categories; what we shared was a resistance to being dominated by ANY rigid       aesthetic proposition and a need for asserting new choices; we also craved       significant dialogue with the few scholars who were seriously working, at       that time, on the great modernist texts by those women writers we'd been       denied access to in our university reading curricula. <br>      <br>      So our urgency was two-fold: empowerment through editorial choice and the       creation of a community of shared scholarship and innovative poetries being       written by contemporary women. Since that time, complex discussions of gender       stereotype have opened our questions further. Is it still a pressing need,       a viable project, to create a gender-specific poetics journal? This question       is argued in the FORUM section of this first issue and we will be interested       in reader response. My position--at the moment--concentrates on practice       and a site of focus directed to reading responses written by women, about       women's published texts, as well as a continuing place to publish newly-made       work. However, the new structure of production puts into place, with issue       n.2, the model of revolving guest-editorships of several sections in which       the guest editor is fully empowered to include whatever readings she finds       significantly relevant to this project. Within these exchanges, gender exclusivity       may not be the point nor the preferred choice. <br>      <br>      This rotation of editors--editorial sensibilities--will also address the       question of what it means to write &quot;experimentally,&quot; to practice innovation,       to swerve away from the givens as they inevitably harden into mandate. By       offering a selection of models for writing about one's reading experience--via       the reading/s, alerts and postcard sections--it is hoped that issues of       &quot;not enough time&quot; or &quot;in-draft&quot; projects will be set aside as reasons for       putting-off proposals for this discussion. While HOW2 will be a carefully       edited journal and does not offer a &quot;chatbox&quot; or list.serv model, it is       actively seeking to broaden the practice and the styles of responsive thinking       as readers/writers. A &quot;Workbook&quot; section will be put into place as soon       as drafts and works-in-progress become available. The terms will develop       as more readers become contributors. -- Kathleen Fraser, Editor       <hr>      <b>HOW2</b> <br>      <br>      <b>Editor/Publisher:</b> Kathleen Fraser <br>      <br>      <b>Managing Editor:</b> Jo Ann Wasserman<br>      <b>Designers:</b> Stan Friedman &amp; Roberta Sims<br>      <b><br>      Editorial Advisory Board:</b> <br>      <b>Etel Adnan:</b> Paris, Sausalito, Beirut/ <b>Caroline Bergvall:</b> London,       Dartington College/ <b>Eileen O'Malley Callahan</b>: UC Berkeley/ <b>Marina       Camboni:</b> Rome, Universita di Macerata/ <b>Kornelia Freitag:</b> University       of Potsdam/ <b>Elisabeth Frost:</b> NYC, Fordham University/ <b>Susan Gevirtz:</b>       San Francisco, Sonoma State University/ <b>Eileen Gregory:</b> University       of Dallas/ <b>Cynthia Hogue:</b> Lewisburg (PA), Bucknell University/ <b>Myung       Mi Kim:</b> San Francisco State University/ <b>Linda Kinnahan:</b> Pittsburgh,       Duquesne University/ <b>Michele Leggott:</b> University of Auckland (NZ)/       <b>Nicole Markotic: </b>University of Calgary (BC)/ <b>Hannah Moeckel-Rieke:</b>       Free University of Berlin/ <b>Marina Morbiducci:</b> Rome/ <b>Harryette       Mullen:</b> UCLA, Los Angeles / <b>Frances Presley</b>: London/ <b>Meredith       Quartermain:</b> Vancouver, Capilano College/ <b>Linda Russo:</b> SUNY Buffalo/       <b>Meredith Stricker:</b> Carmel Highlands (CA)/ <b>Cole Swensen:</b> University       of Denver/ <b>Ann Vickery:</b> Sydney (AU), Macquarie University/ <b>Momoko       Watanabe:</b> Tokyo Metropolitan University<br>      <br>      <br>      HOW2 Internet Address (Bookmark it!):<br>      <a HREF="http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2">http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2</a>       <br>      <br>      Editorial correspondence may be e-mailed to:<br>      <a HREF="mailto:kfraser@sfsu.edu">kfraser@sfsu.edu </a> or <a HREF="mailto:twoswirl@aol.com">twoswirl@aol.com</a>       <br>      <br>      <hr>      <b>The HOW(ever) Archive, at Rutgers<br>      </b><br>      <br>      Rutgers' Scholarly Communication Center will host the HOW(ever) archive       on its web server at the address: <a href="../archive.html">http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/however</a>.       The HTML editions of the original print version, volumes I-VI, [May 1983-January       1992] are available.
