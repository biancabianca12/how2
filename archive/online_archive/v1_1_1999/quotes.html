This is what wehave been speaking of--the radicalizing potential of writing the Imaginaryand entering political agency.  I do not mean to suggestsubstitutability-- insert poetic freedom and there will be a solution,resolution of this or that problem of justice, faith, or love.  I do mean:the ear by which the measure by which the prosody by which to calibrate andgauge the disaster, the repression and by enervating it into something of asustained and engaged acitivity of the living, by responsiveness-- (therepressive cathected to resilience, at responsiveness)--adding to thestorehouse, the storehive of the human--  the very difficulty of it,carries the possibility of the liberatory.<br><br>&quot;Dignity of the human voice-- word  meaning  and act.&quot;<br><br>      -- Myung Mi Kim on January 30, 1999, as part of the Small Press Traffic       series at New College, San Francisco. Myung Mi Kim's books of poems include       <i>Dura</i> (Sun &amp; Moon Press) and <i>The Bounty </i>(Chax Press); Kelsey       St. Press has just released the second printing of <i>Under Flag</i>.

The 'imaginal' values of maleness have not been suppressed/discredited/denied       but rather vaunted: . . . positive values for maleness (as distinct from       'humanness'), remain suspect, at least for the present, as socially adaptive       strategies to maintain control and power. <br>      <br>. . . it it not surprising that many men express resentment toward feministpoetries in a variety of ways: for it is precisely the position of theunrepresented or the subaltern that straight, white American men arerightlyexcluded from occupying in any primary way.<br><br>. . .Within this context, the questioning, through poetic methods, of theauthoritative structures of our society is useful for both men and women.<br><br>.. . it is useful to read works by men and women differentially, taking noteof the different aesthetic and social meanings of works when read in termsof gender.&quot;<br><br>      -- Charles Bernstein, in <i>My Way: Speeches and Poems</i> (University of       Chicago Press,1999).
