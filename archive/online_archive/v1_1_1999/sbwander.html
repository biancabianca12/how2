I'd taken and developed manyrolls of black and white film of that beautiful coastline, a lilypond, state fair and made contact sheets, but never printed them.I'd had it in mind for years to print them and did a couple weeksago when thinking about &quot;A Translation of Spaces&quot;-- the theme ofHOW2's first issue.  How curious to see photos of myself young, thin,and shy.  Somehow it made this time of staying still more possible --seeing how vulnerable I looked then.  There were pictures of my fatherin his studio, cutting mats in his precise, graceful way.  An oldboyfriend, smoking a cigar, reading the racing form.  I'd wanted to use thephotos of the lily pond in the frame of the pelvis but they weren'tdistinct enough from each other to be meaningful.  I've made several copies of the x-rayand will try a series.<br><br>I've had to work on it bit-by-bit -- the positive of the x-ray is mine; aswollen disk and displaced sciatic nerve has kept me mostly on my backfor a few weeks. I have to plan each little trip to photolab or xeroxstore.  Standing for more than ten minutes is no good -- sitting for morethan half an hour isn't good either.  It's nothing permanent, only painfulif I overdo, and a little &quot;nerve wracking.&quot;</font><hr><font FACE="Palatino"><a HREF="index.html">go to this issue's table of contents</a><hr><p>  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object></p></body></html>
