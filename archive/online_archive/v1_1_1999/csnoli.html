One of its recurrent themes is the position of the viewing-subject in relation to the depicted subject--who is the subject of the narrative implied in so many of these works. It's clearly a matter of intending (con)fusion, an invitation to let individual identity slide a little, to join in stories  fundamental to the culture, thereby reinforcing the stories themselves and initiating the viewer into the culture as a participant.<br><br>One question I was exploring in writing on these works and on my viewing of them was the relationship of writing to this initiatory process--could writing disrupt it in an interesting way, at the very least creating a self-consciousness that complicates the overlap and reintroduces elements of &quot;personal&quot; decision--in quotes because the question of what 'personal' might, can, does mean is one of the underlying considerations.<br><br> <hr><br><br>excerpts from<b> <i>TRY</i></b><br><br><h4><i><b>NOLI ME TANGERE  </b> Unknown Spanish Painter, early 14th century</i></h4><br><br><b>1</b><br><br>Should the painter be distracted, should some sharp noise alarm him or passing thought disarm.

What if all concerts were performed behind a huge screen onto which was projected a long line of faces all facing us and it had always been done this way. You can see hundreds, even thousands, of faces in fifteen minutes.
