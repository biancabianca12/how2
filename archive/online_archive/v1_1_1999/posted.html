It looks at women artists working with<br>the animal, the beast and related imagery.  It cites Marina Warner's _From<br>the Beast to the Blonde_, which has become an important reference text for<br>women poets too.  I particularly liked a feminist critique of the<br>animal-becomings in &quot;A Thousand Plateaux: Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot; by <br>Deleuze and Guattari. There is also a review of <i>Diva: the Video<br>Installation</i> by Fabienne Auteoud.<br>      -- Frances Presley<br><br><br>      <b><i>Fragmente: Psychoanalysis and Poetics</i>, edited by D.S. Marriott       &amp; Vicky<br>Lebeau, no.  8, Summer 1998.</b><br><br>This special issue tends to assume, in some of its articles, a rather<br>specialist knowledge of psychoanalytic theory.  It includes an article by<br>Vicky Lebeau on &quot;Clinical Poetics&quot; which looks again at Freud's analysis of<br>the dream of Irma's injection.  Irma was the patient who suffered from<br>hysterical choking and was unable to open her mouth properly.  There is<br>also an article by Suzanne Raitt: &quot;Love in the time of Lacan&quot;--the poetry of<br>Veronica Forrest-Thomson.  In both writers Raitt finds a subject impossibly<br>dispersed by the operation of the signifying order in which it must,<br>somehow, find its being; but also of a subject which is inconceivable<br>except as an effect of desire.  Also of interest for women experimental<br>poets is Anthony Mellors' thorough-going attack on Charles Olson's phallic<br>mysticism.  There are two poems by Marjorie Welish in this issue.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    <br>      -- F.P.<br><br><br>      <b>Claudia Rankine, <u>The End of the Alphabet</u>, Grove/Atlantic.</b><br><br>A series of extended meditations--fragmented, impressionistic, often<br>elegiac, both lyrical and resistant.  Rankine's writing is incredibly<br>      evocative of mood &amp; situation, even as it completely eschews narrative structures.<br>      <br>      -- Elisabeth Frost<br><br><br>      <b>Deanne Lundin, <u>The Ginseng Hunter's Notebook</u>, New Issues (forthcoming,<br>April)</b><br><br>This is a collection of often interlinked poems, some very visual in form &amp;<br>others more traditionally formal, exploring questions of knowledge,<br>history, &amp; the nature of healing, both modern &amp; ancient.  They're poems<br>that take leaps &amp; seek, I think, to reinvent the lyric in new forms.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    <br>      -- E.F.<br><br><hr><font FACE="Palatino"><a HREF="index.html">go to this issue's table of contents</a><hr></font></font><p><font FACE="Palatino">  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object>  <font FACE="Palatino"></font></font></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
