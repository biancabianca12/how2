Bayart was an actual person, a knight in France in the early sixteenth century. Over the centuries, the details of his life have mixed with the details of a few other lives and have been enriched with sheer legend until the tale recounted now is a composite life, a personified era.<br><br>One question underlying this book is that of storytelling itself--how much play is there in the ways in which a story can be told? Especially a story that has been told so many times before--how can it live (active) rather than be told (passive). One way Monnier injects life in this case is by fracturing the time limits, by slipping in details from contemporary scenes and concerns, allusions to the occupation of Vietnam, reference to twentieth century objects. This invitation to recognize parallels between the late medieval and the late twentieth century worlds posits the reader as outside both, reinforcing the still understated fact that it's a woman's point of view on an historically male world.<br><br>For it is a man's tale--an old-fashioned tale of gallantry and heroism, with the female characters occupying their traditional places--back home receiving letters, or dead. The woman and woman's world is revealed through perspective, sometimes presented as peripheral characters, elements normally perceived as mere background, such as the trees that play a central role here. She also uses the now-famous series of unicorn tapestries as a principal character in the work, their vividness and their delicacy contrasting with their immobility--theirs is a static world while the male world outside is composed of violent activity.<br><br>However, the real twist that this story receives in its treatment here all happens through language--the story's structure, detail, perspective, pacing and phrasing alter the tale tremendously. Monnier's use of sound, in particular, threatens the narrative line; she is fascinated by sound, and in turn uses it in a fascinating--as in hypnotic--way. The reader is lulled away from the story as a series of events and pulled into a space in which sound creates an imminent field.<br><br>She uses repetition to a similar end, repeating words and phrases until they lose much of their referential power, step out from their service to the story per se and emerge as objects in their own rights.<br><br>Language here is used for the dissolution of the tale as much as for its construction, and these two operations, because they're in direct opposition, create a tension and a continual movement, so that the text has a seething surface and a cyclical path. It remains in a state of active equilibrium--which is a familiar state for accounts of history, for the historical tale--always reconstructed for the given moment, but remaining essentially unchanged and unchangeable over centuries. Can history be translated into each arriving epoch? This is one question that this piece explores. At what point will the narrative break down, and when it does, will it necessarily be meaningless, or will it begin to operate along different principles and in a different key? <br><br><hr><h3>excerpts from <b><u>Bayart</u></b></h3><br><br>from <b>2</b><br><br><nb>And you could say too that there was a certain scent</nb><br><nb>a damp scent, of damp stone, perhaps.</nb><br><nb>Of damp stone behind the stone pond</nb><br><nb>and, in the pond (which wasn't really a pond,</nb><br><nb>maybe hidden by a tree,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;		yet, and no doubt:</nb><br><nb>the leaves of the tree fell lightly on the tepid water.</nb><br><nb>The leaves there smelled of decay.</nb><br><nb>So there were several smells:</nb><br><nb>the smell of  magnolias</nb><br><nb>the smell of damp stone, always smelling a little of the tomb</nb><br><nb>the smell of water and leaves (the decay of leaves on tepid water).</nb><br><nb></nb><br><nb>If you look constantly at a tree: the tree remains eternally a tree </nb><br><nb>but stone crumbles, stone is different.</nb><br><nb>At first glance, trees		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;and stone seem</nb><br><nb>alike but you must add: at first glance only.</nb><br><nb>Then trees and stone become distinct:</nb><br><nb>the trees resemble stone;</nb><br><nb>while stone resembles the stone of an earlier age.</nb><br><nb></nb><br><nb>In the first place: walls		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;walls surrounding a garden,</nb><br><nb>surrounding a mansion, surrounding a hanger, surrounding the stables</nb><br><nb>walls surrounding an estate.</nb><br><nb>Later: walls surrounding a garden, surrounding</nb><br><nb>a mansion, surrounding a barn, surrounding a woodshed,</nb><br><nb>surrounding pasture, but not surrounding the river.</nb><br><nb></nb><br><nb>The river edging the fields, but not protecting the walls.</nb><br><nb></nb><br><nb>On the river, barges, grasses, boats</nb><br><nb>and the smell of decay (of decaying leaves).</nb><br><nb></nb><br><nb>One smell is sort of like another smell.
