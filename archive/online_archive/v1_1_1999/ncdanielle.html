grasp by means of gestures       &nbsp;-&nbsp; looks &nbsp;-&nbsp; more than with words<br>      &nbsp;-&nbsp; already so many men ...<br>      <br>      <br>      February<br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've been walking for a long time -- it's 9:30 &nbsp;-&nbsp;       it's cold &nbsp;&nbsp;I rarely see<br>      streets or people at this hour &nbsp;&nbsp;in this neighborhood the houses       are mute --<br>      people pass quickly &nbsp;-&nbsp; closed &nbsp;&nbsp;walking tightly --       don't know how I got to<br>      this neighborhood &nbsp;-&nbsp; slept at J.'s and walked all the way here       -- like it<br>      follows logically &nbsp;-&nbsp; strange &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;looking at a long and empty day -- nervous --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;there's that exhibit at the Musee d'art moderne &nbsp;&nbsp;to       kill time, not out of<br>      love &nbsp;-&nbsp;<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that cold strange room last night &nbsp;-&nbsp; seeing       myself again in all the bedrooms<br>      &nbsp;-&nbsp; dislocated -- blurred -- bodiless inside those walls -- maybe       a little heat<br>      remaining --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sudden silence -- cold -- and all of a sudden solitude       returns -- bad --<br>      <br>      <br>      <hr>      <br>      <br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;watching the kids in the square just now -- retrieving       childhood sensations<br>      -- earth and water -- fuzzy sensations -- a smell --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;scattered images --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the dining room door ajar and my grandfather in bed       -- face to the wall --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;women sitting around the kitchen table speaking quietly       -- and weeping --<br>      reds and pinks --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the boy in blue -- on a hook hung from the balcony of       the house at one corner<br>      of the square -- and the Germans all over -- the hook -- the garden -- the<br>      entry -- the doorway with masses of red fuschias -- garden masses of apples       --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;one evening in the &quot;house in back&quot; eating pink rat poison       and shrieking --<br>      terror --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;flowers -- frost on the window -- feet warming at the       stove -- scorched<br>      socks -- after school--<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the storms and wind in the pines at Compostal -- the       fire in the living room<br>      hearth --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;listing images when really the smells are what returns       most vividly --<br>      roasted coffee -- detergent -- overripe pears in the loft -- smell of wood       and<br>      wet ground --<br>      <br>      <br>      March<br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such a strange night -- on the Quai des Fleurs -- I've       been living here for a<br>      few days -- very nice apartment -- They're sleeping -- the table faces the<br>      window where I write -- the Seine -- the lights -- water -- calm came back       --<br>      like glancing crystal in the water -- rising and falling -- as real as my       hand<br>      -- my face in the pane -- the Seine's reflections disrupting the lamplight's<br>      opacity -- like crossing dream with reality -- and then a car passes --       from<br>      light to opacity -- disappearance --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tranquility -- very rare peacefulness - after days of       emptiness -- empty<br>      enough to put off getting up -- because of the emptiness itself -- and after<br>      -- completely futile efforts to fill in --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;why despite appearances I go to such lengths to achieve       this feeling<br>      emptiness -- of discomfort -- as though every gesture --every movement were<br>      bringing me nearer to death --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the sensation of emptiness disappeared in that orgasmic       moment --<br>      <br>      <br>      <hr>      <br>      <br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have possibly never been so far into that solitude       as these last months --<br>      it still might not be enough -- there is a vague form of stability left       here<br>      -- of security -- some doubt about what I can stand --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;more wandering -- add leaving the country -- breaking       all bonds -- or<br>      whatever -- being broke in a country I don't know -- maybe --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;probably an illusion -- equating being alone in a room       for days -- and going<br>      off somewhere --<br>      <br>      <br>      April<br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Departure -- tomorrow -- real escape -- I'm going to       Tunisia -- calm --<br>      <br>      <br>      <hr>      <br>      <br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tunis 1<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;here with no break -- already the same life -- I go       to cafés -- I make love<br>      -- I go to films -- I talk to people -- no distance -- I've already been       here<br>      since forever --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but still it's the East -- the light -- the colors --       the beauty -- at least<br>      this: I have new eyes -- senses beginning to function again as though after       a<br>      long illness -- this morning very early -- in the village -- scarcely daybreak<br>      -- through the grillwork on the window -- some noises in the covered streets<br>      -- after making love all night -- body heavy and hot -- impression of<br>      tiredness -- of well-being -- H. motionless -- head on my belly -- almost       cool<br>      -- a smell I couldn't place -- almonds and oranges -- old food -- and then<br>      suddenly in the silence -- a very long sound -- very low -- the slow<br>      modulation of the muezzin -- extraordinary beauty --<br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now here -- in the café -- seated on matting       -- they're playing cards --the<br>      patron sitting on a chair by the stove closes his eyes -- head thrown back       a<br>      little -- he is tall and lean -- looks high as a kite -- they aren't paying<br>      any attention to me -- I'm fine here -- it's raining out -- sound of rain       on<br>      the steps --<br>      <br>      <br>      <hr>      <br>      <br>      &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;Saturday -- evening -- a café -- I'm far away       -- toward Aubervilliers -- I<br>      walked a long time -- spent the last few nights walking -- here the old<br>      neighborhoods-- the houses -- hallways staircases -- little courtyards --       what<br>      goes on in the daytime -- warehouses -- workshops -- people -- their night<br>      deserted -- a few lights farther off -- near the trees -- I'm cold -- bitter<br>      taste of cigarettes -- voices -- a woman singing -- an accomplished liar's<br>      voice -- slightly hoarse -- sad -- a little raw --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;go back and sleep -- get loaded -- no -- stay -- stay       up -- nurture this --<br>      thing that returned by chance -- the silence inside --<br>      <br>      <br>      November<br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;he just left -- when he leaves I never know when I'll       see him again -- always<br>      chance encounters -- or nearly -- today I asked myself what little errors<br>      we've let come between us -- I don't know yet -- I can barely guess --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;why such tenderness in his gestures -- after -- where       there is usually<br>      distance --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;don't be taken in by tenderness -- protect yourself       from it -- I'm sucked in<br>      too easily -- his presence I already live too much in these days -- not       enough<br>      resistance now -- or irony --<br>      <br>      <br>      December<br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am calm -- finally without anxiety -- a certain balance       --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; Y. -- circle around his presence -- no more severing -- or       waiting -- calm --<br>      a kind of delight -- also -- being with him -- finally this is a story I       like<br>      -- I feel good --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but when I'm like this I don't do anything -- unable       to write a word -- I<br>      only write in an anxious state (oh sure)* -- or in times like that -- ideas<br>      for novels arrive -- the story of the port for example -- stupid -- the       novel<br>      is basically a pacific creation -- that releases what's essential -- sensation<br>      of well-being allows time to stretch out -- necessary to the novel -- whereas<br>      the anxiety produces something strong -- complete -- at once -- no going<br>      beyond -- (?)* momentary fixity -- in the anxious state --<br>      <br>      <br>      <hr>      <br>      <br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;totally out of it -- what am I doing here -- with these       kids -- feels like<br>      sweet and well-behaved girls -- never been so isolated in the middle of       a<br>      group -- almost peculiar --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;get out of here at the first possible moment -- get       away from it -- before<br>      the end of resistance -- of rebellion -- before boredom -- exhaustion<br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      1961<br>      <br>      February<br>      <br>      &nbsp;

&nbsp;Tonight I'm starting over -- after these parenthetical       months -- for them --<br>      go real slow -- like the first time going out after being locked up for       ages<br>      --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tonight calm at last -- window open -- a little wind       -- gentle -- feeling my<br>      bathrobe -- music below -- I just picked up K.'s journal -- always the way       to<br>      get back to work when it's not happening -- Kafka or Beckett -- to start       up<br>      again --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nothing is finished -- the problem hasn't been resolved       -- but I'm at the end<br>      of my rope -- still struggling with it -- because it would be easier to       keep<br>      going with them than pick up my life where it left off --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;these months speak years -- many new things -- to be       completely current with<br>      present events -- living the news as it happens -- with no time lag -- now<br>      it's difficult to become nothing but a spectator again --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what counted was the immediate -- objective justification       was impossible --<br>      for what I was doing -- theoretical questions useless -- when I make theory<br>      for others -- I end up not believing it -- immediate action justified<br>      immediately in its entirety -- uncomfortable position but real --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for months no writing -- impossible to reconcile the       two --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;walk paying attention -- I've lost sensation -- closeness       of the outside<br>      world around me -- I'm not connecting with things any more -- could be<br>      irreparable loss -- trying now to recover sensations -- objects for instance<br>      -- the table's smoothness -- its color -- my hand on the paper --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it's raining -- that helps me -- I feel better -- more       differentiated from<br>      things -- from the outside --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;blur already --<br>      <br>      <br>      October<br>      <br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;continuing -- I'm alone in the gallery space -- no options       -- walls -- I<br>      touch the walls -- I press myself against them -- I'll lean from one to       the<br>      other -- I stayed in the corner opposite for ten minutes -- now I'm in the<br>      middle of the room on a chair -- writing on my lap -- the empty space all<br>      around -- spinning --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what to do -- yell -- call out -- for someone to come       -- wait -- slow death<br>      --<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;explosion inside my head -- words -- invent words --       fast -- absence -- non-<br>      sense of words --<br>      &nbsp;
