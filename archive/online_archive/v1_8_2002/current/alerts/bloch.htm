<P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="CENTER">Review of Elizabeth Robinson&#146;s <I>Harrow</I> and Robin Caton&#146;s <I>The Color of Dusk</I> (both from Omnidawn Press, 2001)</P>
<P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Julia Bloch</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Claudia Keelan has called Elizabeth Robinson &#147;a heretic in the best company,&#148; a poet whose engagement with language puts her at odds with prescribed forms of discourse and worship.<A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1" TITLE=""> [i] </A> Robinson&#146;s new collection of poems from Omnidawn Press, <I>Harrow</I>, invokes the intersection of faith, will and poetics, with the body and the self a backdrop to or central part of that intersection. But rather than simply destabilizing prescribed notions of discourse and worship, as the work of any good heretic does, Robinson&#146;s spare, precise, and capacious poetry leads us continually toward the possibility inherent in how faith and meaning interact with language.</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In an unusual move for such subtle poetry, Robinson includes a declaration of sorts regarding her poetic practice. At the center of <I>Harrow</I>, she includes a &#145;Note&#146; as preface to the long sequence &#147;As Betokening.&#148; This prose block begins with an image of faith and doubt as twin girls, &#147;little hooligans&#148; who shouldn&#146;t, but do, fight, who refuse to see each other as carbon copies of themselves. The self appears, donning tradition &#147;like a daily uniform, unattractive but reasonably comfortable,&#148; only to feel &#147;naked and uncomfortably doubled.&#148; (34)</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We then are presented with a descriptive statement about the sequence &#151; &#147;These poems are a story&#148; &#151; in which Robinson traces her entrance into theological education and the particular way in which her journey of faith, skepticism and will led her to poetry: &#147;This poem struggles with that transgressive will, that bullheaded will tethered as it is, on the one hand to a faith and faith&#146;s attendant tenderness for the open door of language and, on the other, with the real but unstable value, the unbearable constraint of tradition&#146;s grammar.&#148; (34) Robinson follows this haunting description of the &#147;open door of language&#148; with a literal door, this one in the Virgin&#146;s abdomen in the Cluny Museum in Paris, behind which we see God himself, &#147;seated in her hips.&#148; This is a poet keenly aware of the ways concerns of language intersect with concerns of the female body; one thinks too of philosophical arguments as to the ways the female body is inscribed by, and inscribes, language.</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The &#145;Note&#146;frames the &#145;As Betokening&#146; sequence well. Page by page, <I>Harrow</I> enters the open door of language, and as a constantly unfolding text, one in which a poet&#146;s will finds itself drawn both to faith and to &#147;tradition&#146;s grammar,&#148; its words resist straightforward decoding. As with the door in the Virgin&#146;s abdomen, I keep coming across &#147;unexpected hinges&#148; that reveal a &#147;discrepancy,&#148; at which the reader might gape, &#147;mostly in relief&#148; &#151; here, &#147;relief&#148; could describe the reader&#146;s experience or the visual image rendered three-dimensional. Robinson establishes the poet early in the book as an observer of these phenomena, yet by the end, the &#145; I&#146;(the will?) has become &#147;hypothetical.&#148; (In &#147;Appointment,&#148; we have an &#147;I, / hypothetical / cathedral,&#148; no less; and in &#147;Entry for Song,&#148; a supplication, as well as a pun on the body and faith: &#147;Have mercy / on that temple, that is / my forehead.&#148; (82)) After the book has traveled the self through scripture, poems near the end of <I>Harrow</I> offer a sense of the self as not merely grappling with these questions, but configured by them.</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In addition to an awareness of the visual body&#146;s resonances with other kinds of structures, I am also struck by the degree to which these poems feel ekphrastic, which perhaps isn&#146;t so unexpected for poetry that makes use of iconography to grapple with questions of worship. These poems&#146;use of the visual field raises questions of empiricism, of the collision between faith and what we observe to be true, as in &#147;Experience,&#148; a poem whose speaker seems to address the heretic: &#147;I try to defend the orthodoxy of the icon, of uranos and gaia: / Any sane person can compare. But, heretic, / you move among the forms of illogic while the form speaks to you. / Where vision precedes hearing. Can&#146;t the form / of the evangel be reborn alike in eclipse?&#148; (7) This issue circles back to questions of the self when Robinson writes in &#147;Entry for Song,&#148; &#147;Streaks, / covenanted / sleepless eye / on this.&#148; (84) In an apparent pun on the &#147;I,&#148; whose covenant with God makes faith possible, the &#147;eye,&#148; an organ whose main function is apprehension, lies sleepless and aware.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">***</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Similarly, in <I>The Color of Dusk</I>, Robin Caton uses innovative forms to destabilize notions of line, boundary, the visual, and self in poetry. The book&#146;s organization by color &#151; gray, purple, green, red, orange, white, blue, and black &#151; and individual poems&#146;use of color lend an ekphrastic feel to the collection. More specifically, this employment of discrete elements of color parallels the poems&#146;mindfulness of discrete elements of language, recalling William James&#146; argument that &#147;We ought to say a feeling of <I>and</I>, a feeling of <I>if</I>, a feeling of <I>but</I>, and a feeling of <I>by</I>, quite as readily as we say a feeling of <I>blue</I> or a feeling of <I>cold</I>.&#148;<A HREF="#_edn2" NAME="_ednref2" TITLE=""> [ii] </A></P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">James would certainly be cheered by Caton&#146;s &#147;Writing Mind&#148; : &#147;in here&#146;s the small / article pinging against itself&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the metallic / <I>o</I>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; wishing and not making itself / concrete.&#148; (46) Caton&#146;s derangement of syntax and line once or twice borders on the overwrought, as when a poem punctuated without spaces between words is somewhat blandly called &#147;Boundary.&#148; However, her poetic unraveling of Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko&#146;s sentiment that &#147;There&#146;s no such thing as good painting about nothing&#148; in the &#147;Blue&#148; section is utterly inventive, playful, and pleasing to the eye. Using Steinian recurrence and actively engaging with the poem&#146;s visual field, Caton&#146;s poems splash across the page&#146;s canvas in poetic and philosophical strokes, as in &#147;e v e n b l u e e x p a n d s,&#148; a poem that poses an argument about the simple power of color. This attention to the raw materials of poetry also makes for beautifully lyric moments, such as &#147;lines in the body like salt&#148; in &#147;Study for <I>The Color of Dusk</I>.&#148;</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like Robinson, Caton interrogates the I, often removing it altogether from the poem yet acknowledging its centrality to the debate she introduces via Wittgenstein: &#147;We must do away with all explanation and description alone must take its place.&#148; (39)The I makes its first appearance in <I>The Color of Dusk</I> in apparent opposition to the poems&#146; other concerns: &#147;<I>I</I> like a housefly / persists&#148; (9); like the &#147;hypothetical I&#148; in <I>Harrow</I>, the I in Caton&#146;s &#147;East Bay Vivarium&#148; is an essential part of the line/boundary question:</P>

<P>The floating I not as angle/line/ 
<BR>angle but as curve/curve/curve 
<BR>so that all falls back on itself like 
<BR>eggs in dough. 
<BR>Fortunate. Fortune.it. The in/ 
<BR>flux in/flight. In/ 
<BR>ternal meanings unleashed. Ins 
<BR>flying in darkness unable 
<BR>to land and the flux 
<BR>waiting like a lover on a mountain 
<BR>for the hopeless ins, 
<BR>the magnificent ins. (14-15)</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Using slashes to indicate literal and suggested line breaks, the poem both investigates how the I is a continual curve and suggests a curve can contain a line, or a discontinuity.</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If the self in <I>Harrow</I> is configured by questions of faith and will, the self in<I> The Color of Dusk</I> might be configured by questions of faith, boundary and the visual. &#147;Prelude to Silence,&#148; the last poem in the collection, opens with words from Edmond Jab&#232;s: &#147;To be in the book. To figure in the book of questions, to be a part of it. To be responsible for a word or a sentence, a stanza or a chapter.&#148; (80) The quote seems to frame Caton&#146;s poems as ones that, for all their innovation and rule-breaking, refuse to evade the question of accountability, of ownership, of the self. Caton writes, &#147;I am not happy with the page.<I> I will evoke the book and provoke the questions. </I>/ What word desires me? / Courage, courage. We are not dreaming. We are not yet dreaming. We are not yet / What word prepares the self for death?&#148; (80) Whether the death is that of the self in the poem or a literal death, Caton&#146;s awareness of how essential the word is to our experience casts a new light on how her poetry challenges boundaries.</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The powerful &#147;Prelude&#148; also couples an awareness of the poem, the book, as &#147;objectified&#148; with a reference to Moses&#146;receiving the tablets on Mount Sinai, then destroying them in anger: &#147;Subject/object vying. Each half cracked. Wherein dwells the holy.&#148; (80) Both Robinson and Caton embark on a journey toward how that question of the holy, the possibility of faith, rests in that struggle between text and self, subject and object, the will&#146;s and the word&#146;s destructive and constructive power.</P>
