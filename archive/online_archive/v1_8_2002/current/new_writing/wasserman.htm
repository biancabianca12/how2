            <p class="DOUBLESPACE">The inspiration for “Boustrophedon” begins 
              with some pretty old tech. During a visit with my students to the 
              new Greek and Roman Galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
              New York, we saw a vase on which boustrophedon letters had been 
              painted beside the characters on the vase: names that sometimes 
              read right to left, sometimes right to left, depending on the profile 
              of the figure. The word means “ox-turn,” according to the Liddell 
              and Scott lexicon, which is blissfully <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry=#20689"><strong>on-line</strong></a>.</span></tt></p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td height="244" colspan="2"><p class="DOUBLESPACE">The scribe would 
              reach the end of his section of parchment or tablet of clay, and 
              instead of lifting his stylus to return to the side on which he’d 
              begun to write, he would simply drop down a line and begin to write 
              in the other direction: just as if he were driving oxen over a field 
              to plow. I started the poem off by hand, which proved to be how 
              I’d write the whole thing; once I started to type it up, I realized 
              I was in trouble. Microsoft Word just had no idea about how to do 
              what I needed. A colleague from the United States Merchant Marine 
              Academy, Dr. Charles Schultheiss, lent me a copy of PhotoShop, which 
              helped me to visualize what I wanted for the first twenty lines 
              or so, but I was flipping every other line and pasting it in; the 
              flipped and pasted letters were blurry and gray. The poem was still 
              growing. I went back on line to search Boustrophedon, and <a href="http://traevoli.com/boust/select_file.php"><strong>the 
              following site turned up.</strong></a>
<p class="DOUBLESPACE">This marvellous location, created by Simmon Keith, 
              would turn any prose text into a boustrophedon image. Alas, I had 
              this poem that did not automatically wrap or justify: its line breaks 
              didn't fit the program. I contacted Simmon, who generously not only 
              rewrote his program to accommodate the poem's format (for which 
              he's been thanking me!), but also typed the poem up all over into 
              the new program, gracefully bearing with my additions and revisions 
              to the text. Once it was finished, we had to scale it to a readable 
              format: a “tiny” one put the whole piece onto one page, but a two-page 
              one was more readable and graceful. I was delighted that he had 
              formatted the piece in such a way that the lines meandered across 
              the page: my first time out behind an ox, I couldn’t hold the plow 
              straight at all. I am now considering another poem in boustrophedon 
              format, but with counted characters, so that the full-page image 
              is more controlled.</td>
