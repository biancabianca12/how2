      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The opening epigraph is from Skelton’s poem “Speke Parot,” 
        about a multilingual import who goes to school with ladies. The reflection 
        of language as mimicry, a physical activity divorced from semantics, refers 
        me back to considerations of prosody as a kind of physical cognition — 
        though Skelton’s imputations about women’s speech are obviously a keen 
        instance for critique. I’m hoping next to work towards fulfilling the 
        promise of occasional poetry, to extend beyond occasion into the perception 
        and celebration of shared, communal time, through form and prosody, not 
        just through simultaneous recognition of events, news quotes; but don’t 
        yet know how.</P>

      <p>Ramy 
        delivers at last. A golden calf looped and branded<br>
        </span>tilts 
        its jughead toward fence, pile of decadent matter<br>

        </span>we 
        worship a finished form, his neck weeping<br>
        </span>in 
        the thorn and sun loam.  On them thorn, tying<br>
        </span>            
        Afghan lips to the outback<br>
        </span>                        
        and the lips to pleasure they suck<br>
        </span>                        
        up another blow from the fascists;<br>
        </span>            
        that new low is nothing new.<br>
        </span>With 
        the burnt end they can scratch grammar<br>

        </span>seal

        </span>that 
        barrel end smoking against appropriate<br>
        </span>dawn 
        targets and smaller game: what have we<br>
        </span>                        
        here unearthed, the shabby form<br>
        </span>                        
        and the blank looks as film<br>
        </span>                        
        wraps up in celluloid opaque<br>
        </span>and 
        brimming that girl target. </span></p>
      <p>2.</span></p>
      <p>Yet 
        I brought the calf here because her blank<br>
        </span>eye 
        triggers our milk to come in, venus blood<br>
        </span>frothing 
        over as dairy goodness, back and white.<br>
        </span>            
        Ramy delivered the news into<br>
        </span>                        
        my private drawing<br>
        </span>                        
        room enclosed in bitemarks.<br>
        </span>            
        His tenderness was another trademark<br>
        </span>                      
          of the stoa, the meat market<br>
        </span>                        
        where we sheltered from the onslaught<br>
        </span>            
        of Israeli bullets and dumb propaganda.<br>
        </span>            
        I held my breath in the bus shelter, and drew<br>
        </span>                        
        in more asphyxiating beliefs for want<br>
        </span>                        
        forward-thinking about fresh air.<br>
        </span>Now, 
        maybe the levels are better: iron droplets<br>
        </span>in 
        saturation, gold in the Czech drinks and blood<br>
        </span>in 
        the French letters alerting<br>
        </span>another 
        woman at last.</span></p>
      <p>3.</span></p>
      <p>Between 
        the sheets I dawdled in wishfulness<br>
        </span>that 
        came to smell me, regranulated sugar<br>
        </span>from 
        toxins I allow myself crusting<br>
        </span>            
        my lips and my cunt.<br>
        </span>          
                      The plane, flight’s unbearable<br>
        </span>                        
        fervor pooled in hollow bones<br>
        </span>                      
          made an act of musculature,<br>
        </span>            
        I see it bounce off the water strip<br>
        </span>and 
        I set us free by recognizing fantasy.<br>
        </span>Ramy 
        part of the clear sapphire that blinds<br>
        </span>and 
        comforts this clouded eye, comes out of heaven<br>
        </span>and 
        sits on my desktop.<br>
        </span>           
        Our exchange is morbid, a free state<br>
        </span>                        
        and social being loaned out<br>
        </span>                        
        for patterned conversation,<br>
        </span>                        
        the law traded for an idol<br>
        </span>                        
        precarious as a standard yet<br>
        </span>               
                 saved from slaughtering by<br>
        </span>                        
        a finished form of calf and binding,<br>
        </span>            
        that simile informant who smiles as he ascends<br>
        </span>stairs 
        to the second landing.  Who will write a new<br>
        </span>formula 
        for addressing these locations earth<br>
        </span>just 
        material dispersing with wave motion,<br>
        </span>            
        petty freedoms of living bodies,<br>
        </span>when 
        all is lost in the reflex.</span></p>
