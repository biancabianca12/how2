  </p>
        <p>1. there have been no words.<br>
          i have not written one word.<br>
          no poetry in the ashes south of canal street.<br>
          no prose in the refrigerated trucks driving debris and dna.<br>
          not one word. 
        <p>today is a week, and seven is of heavens, gods, science.<br>
          evident out my kitchen window is an abstract reality.<br>
          sky where once was steel.<br>
          smoke where once was flesh. 
        <p>fire in the city air and i feared for my sister’s life in a way never<br>
          before. and then, and now, i fear for the rest of us. 
        <p>first, please god, let it be a mistake, the pilot’s heart failed, the<br>
          plane’s engine died.<br>
          then please god, let it be a nightmare, wake me now.<br>
          please god, after the second plane, please, don't let it be anyone<br>
          who looks like my brothers. 
        <p>i do not know how bad a life has to break in order to kill.<br>
          i have never been so hungry that i willed hunger<br>
          i have never been so angry as to want to control a gun over a pen.<br>
          not really.<br>
          even as a woman, as a palestinian, as a broken human being.<br>
          never this broken.&nbsp; 
        <p>more than ever, i believe there is no difference.<br>
          the most privileged nation, most americans do not know the difference<br>
          between indians, afghanis, syrians, muslims, sikhs, hindus.<br>
          more than ever, there is no difference. 
        <p>2. thank you korea for kimchi and bibim bob, and corn tea and the<br>
          genteel smiles of the wait staff at wonjo smiles never revealing<br>
          the heat of the food or how tired they must be working long midtown<br>
          shifts. thank you korea, for the belly craving that brought me into<br>
          the city late the night before and diverted my daily train ride into<br>
          the world trade center. 
        <p>there are plenty of thank yous in ny right now. thank you for my<br>
          lazy procrastinating late ass. thank you to the germs that had me<br>
          call in sick. thank you, my attitude, you had me fired the week<br>
          before. thank you for the train that never came, the rude nyer who stole<br>
          my cab going downtown. thank you for the sense my mama gave me<br>
          to run. thank you for my legs, my eyes, my life. 
        <p>3. the dead are called lost and their families hold up shaky<br>
          printouts in front of us through screens smoked up. 
        <p>we are looking for iris, mother of three. please call with any<br>
          information. we are searching for priti, last seen on the 103rd<br>
          floor. she was talking to her husband on the phone and the line<br>
          went. please help us find george, also known as adel. his family is<br>
          waiting for him with his favorite meal. i am looking for my son, who<br>
          was delivering coffee. i am looking for my sister girl, she started<br>
          her job on monday. 
        <p>i am looking for peace. i am looking for mercy. i am looking for<br>
          evidence of compassion. any evidence of life. i am looking for<br>
          life. 
        <p>4. ricardo on the radio said in his accent thick as yuca, “i will<br>
          feel so much better when the first bombs drop over there. and my<br>
          friends feel the same way.” 
        <p>on my block, a woman was crying in a car parked and stranded in hurt.<br>
          i offered comfort, extended a hand she did not see before she said,<br>
          “we’re gonna burn them so bad, i swear, so bad.” my hand went to my<br>
          head and my head went to the numbers within it of the dead iraqi<br>
          children, the dead in nicaragua. the dead in rwanda who had to vie<br>
          with fake sport wrestling for america’s attention.&nbsp; 
        <p>yet when people sent emails saying, this was bound to happen, lets<br>
          not forget u.s. transgressions, for half a second i felt resentful.<br>
          hold up with that, cause i live here, these are my friends and fam,<br>
          and it could have been me in those buildings, and we’re not bad 
        <p>people, do not support america’s bullying. can i just have a half<br>
          second to feel bad? 
        <p>if i can find through this exhaust people who were left behind to<br>
          mourn and to resist mass murder, i might be alright.<br>
          thank you to the woman who saw me brinking my cool and blinking back<br>
          tears. she opened her arms before she asked “do you want a hug?” a<br>
          big white woman, and her embrace was the kind only people with the<br>
          warmth of flesh can offer. i wasn’t about to say no to any comfort.<br>
          “my brother’s in the navy,” i said. “and we’re arabs.” “wow, you<br>
          got double trouble.” word. 
        <p>5. one more person ask me if i knew the hijackers.<br>
          one more motherfucker ask me what navy my brother is in.<br>
          one more person assume no arabs or muslims were killed.<br>
          one more person assume they know me, or that i represent a people.<br>
          or that a people represent an evil. or that evil is as simple as a<br>
          flag and words on a page. 
        <p>we did not vilify all white men when mcveigh bombed oklahoma.<br>
          america did not give out his family’s addresses or where he went to<br>
          church. or blame the bible or pat robertson. 
        <p>and when the networks air footage of palestinians dancing in the<br>
          street, there is no apology that hungry children are bribed with<br>
          sweets that turn their teeth brown. that correspondents edit images.<br>
          that archives are there to facilitate lazy and inaccurate<br>
          journalism. 
        <p>and when we talk about holy books and hooded men and death, why do we<br>
          never mention the kkk? 
        <p>if there are any people on earth who understand how new york is<br>
          feeling right now, they are in the west bank and the gaza strip. 
        <p>6. today it is ten days. last night bush waged war on a man once<br>
          openly funded by the<br>
          cia. i do not know who is responsible. read too many books, know<br>
          too many people to believe what i am told. i don’t give a fuck about<br>
          bin laden. his vision of the world does not include me or those i<br>
          love. and petittions have been going around for years trying to get<br>
          the u.s. sponsored taliban out of power. shit is complicated, and i<br>
          don’t know what to think. 
        <p>but i know for sure who will pay. 
        <p>in the world, it will be women, mostly colored and poor. women will<br>
          have to bury children, and support themselves through grief. “either<br>
          you are with us, or with the terrorists” — meaning keep your people<br>
          under control and your resistance censored. meaning we got the loot<br>
          and the nukes. 
        <p>in america, it will be those amongst us who refuse blanket attacks on<br>
          the shivering. those of us who work toward social justice, in<br>
          support of civil liberties, in opposition to hateful foreign<br>
          policies. 
        <p>i have never felt less american and more new Yorker — particularly brooklyn,<br>
          than these past days. the stars and stripes on all these<br>
          cars and apartment windows represent the dead as citizens first — not<br>
          family members, not lovers. 
        <p>i feel like my skin is real thin, and that my eyes are only going to<br>
          get darker. the future holds little light. 
        <p>my baby brother is a man now, and on alert, and praying five times a<br>
          day that the orders he will take in a few days time are righteous and<br>
          will not weigh his soul down from the afterlife he deserves.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          both my brothers — my heart stops when i try to pray — not a beat to<br>
          disturb my fear. one a rock god, the other a sergeant, and both<br>
          palestinian, practicing muslim, gentle men. both born in brooklyn<br>
          and their faces are of the archetypal arab man, all eyelashes and<br>
          nose and beautiful color and stubborn hair. 
        <p>what will their lives be like now? 
        <p>over there is over here. 
        <p>7. all day, across the river, the smell of burning rubber and limbs<br>
          floats through. the sirens have stopped now. the advertisers are<br>
          back on the air. the rescue workers are traumatized. the skyline is<br>
          brought back to human size. no longer taunting the gods with its<br>
          height. 
        <p>i have not cried at all while writing this. i cried when i saw those<br>
          buildings collapse on themselves like a broken heart. i have never<br>
          owned pain that needs to spread like that. and i cry daily that my<br>
          brothers return to our mother safe and whole. 
        <p>there is no poetry in this. there are causes and effects. there are<br>
          symbols and ideologies. mad conspiracy here, and information we will<br>
          never know. there is death here, and there are promises of more. 
        <p>there is life here. anyone reading this is breathing, maybe hurting,<br>
          but breathing for sure. and if there is any light to come, it will<br>
          shine from the eyes of those who look for peace and justice after the<br>
          rubble and rhetoric are cleared and the phoenix has risen. 
        <p>affirm life.<br>
          affirm life.<br>
          we got to carry each other now.<br>
          you are either with life, or against it.<br>
          affirm life.</p>
