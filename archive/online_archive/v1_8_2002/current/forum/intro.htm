            New York City Women Writers Recall September 11, 2001</span></b>&#148;</P>
          <P CLASS="TITLE2">Laura Hinton</P>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Introduction</b>&nbsp;</P>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>“All has shifted from the experience to the 
            industry of contemplating it.” Lines like poetry come into my head 
            half out of some forgotten dream. It is early in the morning, this 
            day, late in June. Last night, I went to a book party celebrating 
            the Etruscan Press anthology,</i> September 11: American Writers Respond<i>. 
            One of the tens of contributors, I listened to editor William Heyen’s 
            moving speech. I signed the printed page for well-wishers eating cheese 
            and paté, posed with writers for a photograph. Leaving before the 
            last hangers-on went for beer, I entered the evening blackness; a 
            cloud rumbled and ruptured above me in the sky. The sky I couldn’t 
            see, in mid-town Manhattan, quickly drenched my clothes. I stood for 
            half an hour under a leaky construction awning on Fifth Avenue, as 
            if I could save my summer sandals. The storm did not pass. Braving 
            the torrent in a sprint for Grand Central Station, I was wet and miserable 
            in my irony. </i>&nbsp;</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I recall again September 11, 2001, the day that 
            began, legendarily, that terrible blue, a day as dry and seamless 
            as a New York City day can be. As I write, we near the approach of 
            the anniversary of September 11th. In the inexplicability of landscapes, 
            it is our industry that makes survivors writers and writers survive. 
            We have indeed shifted from the experience — because that’s what survivors, 
            and writers, do. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This section of <i>How2 </i>tells a story unfolding 
            in the year since September 11<sup>th</sup>. Here, New York City women 
            writers speak about “the horror,” to borrow from Joseph Conrad, that 
            ripped through our skyline, and settled like an unwanted guest. Writing 
            from a romanticization but also a critique of the colonial “guest,” 
            Conrad both fetishized and called into question a “horror” within 
            this colonizing “self.” The contributors to this section embrace a 
            similar modernist irony. They do so by adopting, and also jettisoning, 
            this version of “self,” and the memoire as a form. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The words I wrote down that morning in June expressed 
            my growing sense of guilt and frustration about our “self”-expressions 
            since September 11<sup>th</sup>. These words were not a criticism. 
            They were the beginnings of an acceptance that, in fact, “poetry is 
            not a luxury,” as Audre Lorde once wrote, that our writings are as 
            important and serious as the nine-month task of “rescue workers” in 
            lower Manhattan. Our blessed state of discourse is laborious and difficult; 
            and it produces not a clarity but a confusion — one ironically that 
            enunciates its own healing process. When we think about the memoire, 
            in particular — from a post-modern theoretical perspective — we think 
            about it as falsely clarifying, with colonial objectives, a form that 
            would render easy the cultural monological “self.” Indeed, the memoire 
            traditionally has attempted to memorialise — to use a fashionable 
            term — our sentimental faith in language’s zip-lock lucidity. For 
            experimental writers, the memoire rightly could be seen as the effort 
            to falsely construct one’s “self” as protected container, as if one 
            could separate “self” from history and social event. In the case of 
            September 11<sup>th</sup>, this raises grave issues. As Ann Lauterbach 
            poignantly states in “What Is a Day?,” printed here: <i>“To narrate 
            oneself into a catastrophe with vast and unknowable global consequences 
            seems trivial, or vain . . .”</i></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The title phrase of this section, “Memoire/Anti-Memoire,” 
            reflects these questions about using the memoire form as a response 
            to September 11<sup>th</sup>. The phrase contains its dualism, as 
            an insistence that we do narrate our memories, our individual experiences, 
            of September 11th, even if we do so ironically, and, perhaps, differently. 
            This phrase is borrowed from a recent issue of <i>Chain,</i> whose 
            contributors reconsider the possibilities of the memoire from an experimental-writer’s 
            positioning. Its collection of writings suggests that the language 
            of memoire need not attempt to reseal memories as if in a leak-proof 
            box. So, too, the women’s memoirs that follow use and reuse the memoire 
            form to explore tragedy, both personal and social, not through a sentimental 
            re-visioning of events but a re-invention of what and how we articulate 
            them. Our memoirs collectively suggest that writing does not simply 
            “re-collect” past events and refurbish them with a bright new literary 
            engine. Rather, writing exists itself as its own event — as writing. 
            &nbsp; In her study <i>The Body in Pain</i>, Elaine Scarry examined 
            the writings of political torture victims and argued for the necessity 
            of expressing physical pain for political purposes. She also wrote 
            of the impossibility of expressing pain through the medium of language. 
            That necessity, and that inexpressability, I would argue, applies 
            to those trauma victims who observe, so close at hand, human pain 
            and tragedy on a mass scale. As co-victims of mass terror, New Yorkers 
            last September experienced a pain that takes on its own physicality 
            and tragic psychic dimension. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The memoirs that express this experience of pain 
            begin with Suheir Hammad’s “First Words Since.” This powerful memoire-poem, 
            written by the young Palestianian-American poet living in New York, 
            details the suffering of having no words to describe what she has 
            seen by the end of the first week following September 11<sup>th</sup>, 
            what she has felt and feared. In the duality of a gratitude for life 
            and a fear of political reprisals, Hammad begs that the attackers 
            might not look “like my brothers.” It also praises the world of New 
            York City’s streets: the Korean “kimchi and bibim bob” that kept her 
            out late the night before September 11<sup>th</sup>, away from downtown 
            the next morning; a stranger, a woman, who asked her if she wanted 
            “a hug”; the friends and acquaintances who asked, without compunction, 
            if she “knew the hijackers” because she is Arab.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Novelist Jamie Callan’s short theatrical monologue, 
            “Locating the Pain,” was also written in the early days following 
            September 11<sup>th</sup>. It expresses a different set of ironies, 
            the kind that become riveted in the body when painful emotions cannot 
            be expressed and resurface as physical suffering. Removed from the 
            catastrophe in New York City while teaching a screen-writing class 
            at Yale University, Callan tells of a journey to the dentist, in which 
            the pain she could never locate becomes localized in her mouth, in 
            which both a detached dentist and patient try to find “the pain.” 
            This act is perceived as a darkly humorous attempt to control the 
            discourse of disaster through the discourse of the medicalized body 
            — and its own symptoms of emotional repression.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Linsey Abrams’ long poem, “The New Century” suggests 
            that to “locate the pain” is impossible, that the pain fans itself 
            out and becomes a linguistic cornucopia of personal perception against 
            the background of historic drama. Abrams’ “complaint” — a form of 
            the memoire that goes back to the literature of Old English — re-embodies 
            the fragmented sense that we all felt in the early aftermath of September 
            11<sup>th</sup>, that feeling of being both depressed and “on overwhelm.” 
            As we waited for the next terrorist event, for the next wave of anthrax 
            to be exposed on our subway line, for the next death, Abrams wrote 
            this studied piece in manic artifice. Like Callan’s memoire, it ultimately 
            reveals what became for New York City residents and workers our collective 
            depression. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My own memoire, “The Hole I Cannot See: Smoke 
            and Fragments in New York City,” is about that collective depression. 
            It attempts to embody, too, our fragmented sense of living in the 
            city last fall. I tried to mirror in the text those gaps I was experiencing 
            between events and my capacity to observe them, between the information 
            I received and did not. I wanted to trouble the conventions of my 
            reportorial memoire by failing to place those conventions in a coherent 
            whole, to plug the hole that I had not yet seen — left by the World 
            Trade Center and the 3,000 people that perished, and by our own false 
            sense of quotidian agency.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Ann Lauterbach’s “What is a Day?” further radicalizes 
            the memoire as form. While she questions why one should “insert oneself 
            into the cataclysm after <i>the shipwreck of the singular</i>,” she 
            nevertheless writes that “One plus three thousand equals three thousand 
            and one.” She suggests that the “singular,” indeed, is a mathematical 
            exponent that raises casualties and stands alone in one’s difference 
            to mass event. Lauterbach’s piece suggests through poetry and prose 
            — the interpolation of vision, nightmare, and fact — that personal 
            memoire, that the story of one’s day, need not be told from one perspective 
            but from one’s own multiplicities of perspectives. “What is a Day?” 
            shows the uses of the memoire when it is treated as both broken and 
            lucid, as self-reflexive and externally reportorial — and that out 
            of horrific tragedy something as daring as Blake’s tiger emerges steely-eyed 
            and terrifyingly beautiful.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Daniella Gioseffi’s memoire, “Sept. 11th, Meagan’s 
            Birthday,” takes on the political fallout that has ensued following 
            September 11<sup>th</sup>. It narrates events which began as she watched 
            from her rooftop in Brooklyn the United Airlines jet hit the second 
            World Trade Center tower, and which end with a journey to New England 
            and into progressive American history. Telling of her encounter with 
            a perceptive young girl whose birthday falls, and will always fall, 
            on September 11th, Gioseffi uses the conventions of memoire subversively, 
            as political commentary, expressing political ideas and providing 
            information that challenge their current state repression as replicated 
            by the media. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Two final pieces wrestle with our on-going struggle 
            to narrate personal experience after September 11th. Jane Augustine’s 
            “History” tells the story of a friend’s death in the mountains of 
            Colorado, where Augustine was vacationing this summer, a story permeated 
            with fragments of memories of the deaths of September 11<sup>th</sup>. 
            The fragmented images of self-in-memory create these two separate 
            events that remain separate, but also converge in the experimental 
            poetic sequence. Mei-mei Berssenbrugge’s poem, “Safety,” reflects 
            upon the banality we experience as we witness and identify with others’ 
            suffering from a near distance — as if witnessing, identifying, would 
            make them safe. Presented against images of the downtown Manhattan 
            architectural spaces and emptiness, the problem of witnessing in “Safety” 
            is that of an outsider’s perspective of the mass tragedy of September 
            11<sup>th</sup>. That tragedy is “memorialized by what I saw,” through 
            a “singularity” that Berssenbrugge, like Lauterbach, questions, but 
            also reflects back, because that is what separates the “safe” from 
            the perished, the viewer from the viewed.</p>
          
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The women who have contributed these memoire pieces 
        have dared to face their “singularity” in the fact of observing, at close 
        hand, in one’s community, catastrophic event. We are in the process, the 
        writing process, of moving beyond the shell of singular survival and into 
        the shared history of a city and a society that has lost not only an icon 
        but its fear to bear witness. These selective palimpsests, like my drenching 
        cloud that June night, cover but do not alleviate the harshness of our 
        personal-real.&nbsp;</p>
