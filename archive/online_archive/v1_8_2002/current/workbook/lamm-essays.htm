        James Schuyler, Eileen Myles, and the Sexuality of Literary Influence</b></P>
      <P align="center" CLASS="TITLE1">by Kimberly Lamm</P>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">As a poet and a figure, James Schuyler’s place 
            in the New York School canon is assured. But unlike the work of his 
            peers John Ashbery and Frank O’Hara, Schuyler’s influence on subsequent 
            generations of poets has yet to be explored. Perhaps this is so because 
            it is difficult to find cultural corollaries for the sensibilities 
            Schuyler’s work exemplifies: its stilled quietude, its porous attention, 
            its careful but casual portrayals of intimate reflection, its attention 
            to the sensual sheens of light fading into shadow. Ashbery’s pastiche 
            of discourse, polyphone of clashing styles and tender absurdities 
            and O’Hara’s poet as flâneur persona, his talk performing arabesques 
            of wit from a shifting and evasive center, seem now to forsee identities 
            and their accompanying verbal textures are readily available and recognizable 
            by contemporary American culture.  Yet Schuyler’s attention to, in 
            Barbara Guest’s words, “subjective, delicate states” (16) and the 
            ease with which his work elicits similar states in the reader is a 
            sensibility not readily celebrated in contemporary life. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">Schuyler’s work is painterly; it observes and 
            transcribes with color and light, and in turn, enacts and values the 
            kind of attention painting requires, but since the 1970s, painting 
            has since lost its prominence in the visual arts.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [1] </span></a> We would be hard-pressed to hear anyone make the claim 
            Schuyler did in 1959: “in New York the art world is a painter’s world” 
            (1, 1998). Perhaps this is one reason why there isn’t a sustained 
            and collective literary investment, as there was for The New York 
            School poets, to paintings’ nuances of color and light, and the fluid, 
            transformative ease of paint shifting into metaphoric possibility. 
            For Schuyler, attending to the subtle shifts in paint became a means 
            for describing not only the nuances of natural scenes, but the nuances 
            of emotions as they arise in response to the scene before the speaker. 
            In the poem “Evening,” (1974) longing slowly rises to meet the color 
            of an eroding day: </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <div class=Section1>The sullen day<br>
            wears off in a dull blue gray<br>
            it almost hurts to see: so like<br>
            a mood that comes upon you<br>
            unawares, uninvited, unwanted,<br>
            like missing someone, and a long goodbye. (200, 11-16)<a href="#_edn2"

      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">In her essay “The Vuillard of Us” (1990), Guest 
            compares Schuyler’s work to the genre of the still-life and writes: 
            “The poem’s form seems to drop from Schuyler’s hand like those drops 
            from a jug in a Dutch still-life” (16). In the following lines from 
            “Song” (1980), as in so many poems by Schuyler, he arranges a poetry 
            of still-life by letting the light of the scene composed before him 
            drip into the sound and shape of the poem: </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <div class=Section1>The light lies layered in the leaves.<br>
            Trees, trees, and more trees.<br>
            A cloud boy brings the evening paper:<br>
            <i>The Evening Sun. </i>It sets.<br>
            Not sharply or at once<br>
            a stately progress down the sky<br>
            (it’s gilt and pink and faintly green)<br>
            above, beyond, behind the evening leaves<br>
            of trees. (235, 1-9)</div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">Is there anything in contemporary poetry that 
            golden and painterly and slow? The work of Eileen Myles might not 
            immediately come to mind when looking for traces of Schuyler’s influence. 
            Myles writes, and is well known for, representations of sex and sexuality 
            that are far from shy. In “Porn Poems” (1997), for example, Myles 
            writes: </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <div class=Section1>Her tongue &amp; her<br>
            heart were<br>
            throbbing<br>
            in the holster<br>
            of her pussy. (48)</div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">This direct and compact, almost imagist poem, 
            emulates the intense focus and immediacy of sexual experience. Furthermore, 
            Myles’ poems are often blunt and swift; they begin running and slam 
            with affect, as though they are catching up to the immediacy of her 
            reactions. Consider the way “Glove” begins (1997): </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <div class=Section1>I couldn’t get over the weather<br>
            it was like a punch<br>
            that came up from the inside<br>
            a sock to my blood<br>
            everywhere I looked<br>
            I saw trees and the wind<br>
            blowing through them<br>
            a tiny couple in dark<br>
            tables all over New York<br>
            the winter of lies &nbsp;<br>
            entranced in the trees<br>
            as rustness bleeds up from the horizon<br>
            meeting the clouds. (39, 11-13)</div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">“Glove” begins swiftly and bluntly, but as the 
            poem develops, and the horizon takes on the liquid qualities of light 
            and color, Myles’s link to Schuyler’s, “subjective, delicate states” 
            and his passive but always shaping attention makes itself clear. Both 
            Myles and Schuyler render the eye’s passive delectation in light’s 
            movement, acknowledging both its eloquence and ordinariness. Also, 
            the first person “I” is certainly present, but it has a permeable 
            quality, simultaneously shaped by and shaping the scene. The permeability 
            of Schuyler and Myles’s “I” finds its expression in the painterly 
            attention to the colored and sensual—quietly ecstatic—movement of 
            light. As Myles writes in “Twilight Train” (1997),</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <div class=Section1>It’s the sultriness,<br>
            the smokey approach<br>
            of the loss of<br>
            light that I love. (42, 29-32) </div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">For both Schuyler and Myles, the lit sky is a 
            lyrical screen, a projection of the writer’s mind absorbing and meeting 
            the shifting surface of the world. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">I have taken the title for this essay from a 
            review of a Jane Freilicher exhibition Schuyler wrote for <i>Art News 
            </i>in 1958. In this review, Schuyler praises Freilicher’s skill deploying 
            the nuances of her medium to highlight painting’s imaginative and 
            transformative potential. Schuyler states that Freilicher’s painting 
            <i>Russian Summer</i> “abstracts the ripened vision of a page of Pasternak 
            into the deep and cooling fire of an opal: colors the most flowering 
            and succulent, one lighting another, seductively”(1998, 25). Not only 
            does this line evoke the movement from literary to painted images, 
            it describes Schuyler’s and Myles’s shared attention to the movement 
            of light; Schuyler’s line can also be read as a figure for Schuyler’s 
            influence on Myles, which is documented, developed, and complicated 
            in her short-story entitled “Chelsea Girls” (1994). In this essay, 
            I analyze “Chelsea Girls” metaphorically; I read it as a meditation 
            on the relations between literary influence and sexuality and their 
            analogous modes of intimacy and exchange. “Chelsea Girls” represents 
            the influence of one’s literary predecessors on the same sensual and 
            sexual continuum as sex itself. One lights the other, seductively. 
          </p>
          <P class="doublespace">“Chelsea Girls” is a fictionalized representation 
            of Myles’s work taking care of James Schuyler in 1979. After a stay 
            at the Payne-Whitney hospital, Schuyler was living at the Chelsea 
            Hotel, drugged and fragile. The following passage describes Myles’s 
            thoughts after she has left Schuyler and returns to a hotel room where 
            she has been having sex with a girl named Mary. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <div class=Section1>I crawled back into the blue bed with her. She was 
            slightly asleep. Not entirely. I don’t love you I thought. I kissed 
            her. I kissed her again. I thought of the big sunflower man downstairs. 
            He was not sex. It was something else. I hugged her. She was everything 
            else. (275) &nbsp;</div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">Though the speaker attempts to make distinctions 
            between them, what is “sex” and what is “not sex” remains provocatively 
            blurred, vague, and interrelated. Myles doesn’t love the girl she 
            kisses, but does that mean she loves Schuyler, “the big sunflower 
            man downstairs”? Schuyler is “not sex,” does that mean the woman is 
            sex, and is that why she is “everything else”? If Schuyler is not 
            sex, what is the “something else” he is? This essay analyzes the work 
            of Schuyler and Myles and the connections their work makes between 
            the “something else” of literary influence, care, and intimacy, and 
            the “everything else” of sex. “Chelsea Girls” is lit with a care and 
            intimacy that is not sexual, but is still connected to the intensity 
            of experience sex inspires. The story suggests that the intimacy of 
            sex and the intimacy of literary encounters are not clearly distinct, 
            but metaphorically transform into the other, linked by something like 
            the intimacy of care.</p>
          <P class="doublespace">In “Chelsea Girls,” Myles literally cares for 
            Schuyler. She brings him his newspaper, keeps him company, makes him 
            French toast with applesauce, picks up his prescriptions, and perhaps 
            most importantly, narrates the stories of her life as an openly gay 
            young woman living in New York. At one point in the story, Schuyler 
            is a little confused about who Myles slept with last night in the 
            hotel (Schuyler knows Myles and another woman, Christine, live together). 
            Myles’s rendition of their conversation, its quick dialogue snapping 
            between selves, enacts their witty and blurred intimacy: “What’s her 
            name, your friend upstairs. Mary. She was our waitress. Whose? Me 
            and Chris. You girls lead quite an exciting life” (272).<a href="#_edn3"
name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [3] </span></a> </p>
          <P class="doublespace">As a writer who draws from and expands upon his 
            works’ themes and styles, Myles continues her care on a figurative 
            level as well, though the form Schuyler’s influence takes is a homelier, 
            more quotidian sort. Walking into the lobby with Mary, Myles describes 
            her familiarity with the Chelsea Hotel, and compares it to home: “I 
            was very familiar with the place, its smells and sounds and the degree 
            of dilapidation, the ugly art in the lobby that wasn’t distractingly 
            exotic or worthy of note at all. It was normal. It was like fucking 
            at home. You know, like your mother’s home” (269). The hotel is like 
            home, and taking care of Schuyler is a little like taking care of 
            a family member. His appearance here is not the “famous writer” distanced 
            by legend and prestige: “The first day I stood facing him, a thin 
            man with long curly hair rigidly lying on his bed I blurted out I 
            love your poems. He said thank you….Say your favorite poet in the 
            world is lying there. Who you’ve always been told is unmeetable, has 
            nervous breakdowns, is a recluse into SM” (274). “Chelsea Girls” exemplifies 
            a model of literary influence drained of some of its power, allowing 
            for something closer to reciprocity. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">Writing about influence is tricky, especially 
            when it is framed in terms of seduction, and especially when one is 
            writing about women working within a literary tradition such as The 
            New York School, which is as dominated by men as any other. Arguing 
            for an attention to Schuyler’s influence on Myles might risk occluding 
            the directions her work takes that The New York School didn’t; she 
            writes provocatively about class and language, a subject not really 
            part of the New York School’s repertoire.<a href="#_edn4"
name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [4] </span></a> Myles 
            writes about sexuality with a frankness that the New York School poets 
            might only wind through momentarily and deflect with irony. Myles’s 
            continued emphasis on the strength and independence of her persona, 
            found and built and reinforced through writing, doesn’t allow for 
            her work’s particularities to be subsumed under the rubrics influence 
            can provide. At the end of her text “Light Warrior”(1994), Myles writes, 
            “I have waited all my life for permission. I feel it growing in my 
            breast. A war is storming and it is behind me and I am moving my forces 
            into light”(36). And as a feminist writer, Myles constructs texts 
            on the level of craft and style as well as argumentative statement. 
            Her work doesn’t divorce argument and literary texture. So as much 
            as “Chelsea Girls” pays homage to Schuyler and his influence on her 
            work, it is also a subtle but strong critique, not of Schuyler, but 
            of the patriarchy reproduced in representations of literary movements, 
            and especially the record of public mourning, and therefore the memory 
            of prominent literary figures such as Schuyler. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">Discussing the divide between lesbian and gay 
            men in the age of AIDS, Myles states: “Men want to be remembered by 
            men. When a man dies, it’s the need to be valued by men, not women, 
            that counts. History, and we still know who keeps that”(1997, 126). 
            By asserting the value and importance of a person through the authority 
            of men’s words and voices, literature, so intimately connected with 
            loss and remembrance, becomes another means of re-asserting the patriarchal 
            criteria of choice. In an interview I conducted with Myles, she told 
            me she forced herself to write “Chelsea Girls” when Schuyler died 
            in order to insist on and make public, rather than interiorize into 
            privacy, the importance and actuality of women’s responses to and 
            memories of Schuyler’s work, life, and death. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">So it is both surprising and fitting that at 
            the beginning of “Chelsea Girls” there is only a slight hint that 
            Schuyler is a character in the story. “Chelsea Girls” begins with 
            Myles having drinks with her girlfriend Christine and writing a Schuyler-like 
            poem in a bar’s outdoor terrace. Myles spots a cute waitress, and 
            the story focuses on meeting and making-love to this fair-skinned, 
            dark-haired waitress named Mary who Myles describes with pop-art nostalgia. 
            Mary is a veritable Snow White with eyelashes as “black as black window 
            frames”(259). As tangible and strong as this attraction and mutual 
            seduction seems to be, Myles admits to the literary pleasures that 
            underlie her sexual adventure and Schuyler’s importance as the receiver 
            of these tales. Myles writes, “I lived for nights like the one I was 
            about to have with Mary Turner. Actually, the Mary Turner nights sparkled 
            best in the morning recitation of events for the amusement of Jimmy 
            Schuyler”(260).</p>
          <P class="doublespace">This is an easy detail to forget, with all the 
            sparks of seduction and drama in this story, and with all the complicated 
            negotiations between Myles and her sullen and disaffected girlfriend, 
            Christine. They negotiate questions propriety and exclusivity in their 
            relationship. The fluidity of their sexual identities and identifications 
            complicates these questions: “Could we possibly be two boys out cruising 
            women together. But why then was I living with Chris?”(261) Christine 
            sanctions the tryst in a goading way, and Mary and Eileen end up at 
            the Chelsea Hotel. After a night of sex that includes Myles’s reflections 
            on her sexual experiences and preferences — her imaginary image of 
            herself shifts between that of a man and a woman — Myles reminds Mary 
            that she has to go to work. Myles writes: “I’ve gotta go to work. 
            What are you talking about? She was holding my head on her chest. 
            I told you this man I take care of lives here”(271). Perhaps readers 
            of this story are as surprised as Mary when she has to enter “the 
            world of 625”(271). Like Schuyler’s work, Myles’s rendition of his 
            room and their interactions are both imaginative and ordinary--ecceitic.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [5] </span></a> The following passage captures Schuyler’s 
            propensity to simply describe, and the light that opens into this 
            still-life makes the ordinary actuality of things imaginatively glow. 
            Myles writes: “The light flooded in through the windows as I placed 
            the dish down next to Jimmy on his bed. There was a little chair, 
            salmon colored, next to his bed with several packs of Export “A”s, 
            old coffee and rings on the orange seat from other coffee cups”(272). 
            As in his work, the silence in Schuyler’s room is full and resonant: 
            “The silences here in the room, the spaces that linger and fill the 
            air when we speak are what I know about Jimmy more than the things 
            he says” (273). </p>
          <P class="doublespace">What is perhaps most interesting about this scene 
            is Myles’s description of the poles of Schuyler’s attention. It is 
            either entirely absent or entirely focused. Myles writes that “[t]he 
            presence of his attention was so strong, so deeply passive — such 
            a thing to bathe your tiny desperate words in that when it was gone 
            you had to stop and hover in that silence again”(274). Myles describes 
            his inattention in an equally dramatic way: “You’d be hesitatingly 
            starting your story, or like a cartoon character running right in 
            when you realized the long wharf you were taking a short run on, his 
            attention was not there. It was hopeless. The yellow of his room became 
            brighter”(274). It is the yellow light in this story and in this room 
            that becomes a short of shape in which the vicissitudes of Schuyler’s 
            attention are perceived and felt and allowed to shift, and it is the 
            elasticity of that attention that Myles adopts in order to attend 
            to the work of her beloved predecessor and also let her work move 
            in its independent directions. Myles brings the history of her own 
            sexuality to the thick and visible light of room 625. She reflects, 
            “The first time I was in bed with a woman it was also in morning light 
            and so was the first time Christine had her head between my legs” 
            (270). </p>
          <P class="doublespace">The attention, intimacy, and seduction that “Chelsea 
            Girls” transcribes is not completely or thoroughly sexualized sexuality; 
            it is also of the “literary” or even “artistic” kind, revealing that 
            the sex of lust and bodies can inform literary encounters, and the 
            impersonal and imaginative possibilities of literary encounters share 
            the materiality of response and attachment and ardor normally reserved 
            for sex. In other words, there are portrayals of sex in literature, 
            and there are also erotic dimensions of literature and literary, artistic, 
            and personal encounters that are not physical and explicitly sexual, 
            but still involve a sensuality of intimacy, attention, and care. Where 
            does the sensuality of intimacy and care end and where does sex begin? 
            Are there as many differences as we think between the intimacy we 
            receive from and bring to books and the intimacies and care we receive 
            from and give to people? In his study <i>Beyond Sexuality</i> (2000), 
            Tim Dean develops Leo Bersani’s and Ulysse Dutoit’s explorations of 
            human relations to non-human forms. For these thinkers, reformulating 
            human relations to non-human forms becomes a productive way to theorize 
            about art. Dean writes that Bersani’s and Dutoit’s “understanding 
            of relationality raises the possibility that some people ‘love literature’ 
            <i>in exactly the same way </i>as others love sex”(277). Passionate 
            attachments to literature can expand our understanding of sex, and 
            an expanded understanding of sex can expand our understanding of the 
            intimacy and connection writers represent and evoke in their work. 
            Through Myles’s work, we might better glimpse the sexuality at work 
            within Schuyler’s visual attention as well as the full and fluid range 
            of that attention’s active and passive engagement. And through Schuyler’s 
            work, we might better see and appreciate the Myles’s lyrical range. 
            “Chelsea Girls” opens on to a room that suspends these possible connections 
            within its light. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">A recent essay by Juliana Spahr entitled “’Love 
            Scattered, Not Concentrated Love’: Bernadette Mayer’s <i>Sonnets</i>” 
            calls attention to the deliberately unfocused intimacy of Mayer’s 
            sonnets, unloosening entrenched notions of sexuality and their corollaries 
            in entrenched literary forms. For Spahr, Mayer’s work is exemplary 
            for its “refigur[ing] of lyric intimacy as collective and connective 
            spaces” and their various means of “plac[ing] personal relations in 
            a larger network of social concerns” which reconfigures intimacy beyond 
            the individual and the couple (99). In Mayer’s sonnets, “Intimacy 
            is not personal but part of a larger network of reactions and borders 
            that blur, as it is no longer clear where a single person begins and 
            ends” (101). One could say that that Schuyler’s work, particularly 
            his lyrics, concentrate rather than scatter love, but there are moments 
            of openness that blur the distinctions between the single person, 
            the world, and others in Schuyler’s work. I am thinking of all the 
            fading endings of Schuyler’s poems through which the speaker’s self 
            — often barely present — disperses within its deeply focused attention. 
            Consider the ending of “Buildings” (1972); the poem reflects on the 
            choice between one perspective and the possibility of a diffuse multitude:</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <div class=Section1>from among all of you<br>
            one can choose at a time only one<br>
            a woman striding the ragged grass<br>
            her fixed stare devouring the restless river<br>
            striding on the far side of the parkway<br>
            all those cars<br>
            all those millions of windows (87, 24-36)</div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">This poem ends by articulating the structures 
            of attention many of Schuyler’s poems engage with less explicitly. 
            The figure of the woman and her desiring gaze are isolated against 
            the sublime speed of the parkway and all the cars. The speaker of 
            the poem seems suspended between fixed and dispersed engagements. 
            Other poems allow the self to disperse and fade; natural scenes before 
            the speaker become images for that dispersal. The conclusion to “Sleep” 
            (1980), a poems that begins with the lines, “The friends who come 
            and see you/ and the friends who don’t” (1-2) brings a quiet despair 
            to the slowly ecstatic movement of a day closing:</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <div class=Section1>A gold and silver day begins to wane.<br>
            A crescent moon.<br>
            Ice on the window.<br>
            Give my love to, oh, anybody. (13-16)</div>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">As I mentioned above, Dean’s <i>Beyond Sexuality 
            </i>argues for a definition of sexuality that is not only beyond normative 
            heterosexuality, but sexuality and sex as we normally imagine, practice, 
            and elevate it: focused on genitalia, particular bodies and body parts, 
            and the transcendence of orgasm. Dean uses psychoanalysis to emphasize 
            the unconscious dimension of sexuality, which disrupts the Foucault-inspired 
            nature/culture binary that informs so many discussions of sexuality. 
            Seeing the unconscious dimension of sexuality “enlarges the scope 
            of the sexual” and “troubles the border between the sexual and the 
            non-sexual to the point of intelligibility” (270). For Dean, this 
            troubled border points toward interesting ways of formulating relations 
            between the non-human or objecthood of art and the subjective responses 
            of individuals. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">Both Myles and Schuyler attend to objects and 
            discover emotional response through that attention. In a diary entry 
            from May 20<sup>th</sup>, 1990 Schuyler cites the following quotation 
            from the painter Vuillard’s diary: “‘The subject of any work is an 
            emotion simple and natural to the author’”(272). What could be added 
            to that journal entry is that the emotion “simple and natural to the 
            author” arrives through attentive observation to objects outside the 
            self’s subjective experience. Myles’s work often pares down to an 
            emotional simplicity that emerges from clear observation. In “New 
            York Tulips”(1982, 1995) we see Myles’s attention to ordinary details 
            articulated with an honesty that is both tough and tender. In “New 
            York Tulips,” the tulips are perceived with a clarity that enlivens 
            the flowers themselves and the poet’s subjective and metaphoric response. 
            The last line simultaneously narrows with succinctness and expands 
            with the simplicity of emotional resonance: </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <div class=Section1>Some tulips are completely<br>
            red, and some are terribly yellow.<br>
            Then the others shaded by both<br>

            But the mixed tulips<br>
            I love for their compassion. &nbsp;<br>
            They soften the blows<br>
            of this and that.<br>
            I find them very beautiful. (155, 5-12)</div>

      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">Known as an American outlaw poet — Myles was 
            a write-in Presidential candidate in 1992 — who writes about sex and 
            desire with frankness and fearlessness, it is easy to imagine that 
            moments such as this might be looked over in considerations of Myles’s 
            oeuvre. I am not suggesting that the sex of Myles’s work needs to 
            be ignored, or that the thoughtfulness of seemingly non-sexual moments 
            found in poems such as “New York Tulips” are more important than Myles’s 
            attention to sex. I am proposing that they be read as different points 
            on the same continuum. I want to see a poet’s attention to objects 
            and a poet’s attention to sex as two acts that are not radically different, 
            but mutually reinforcing and involved with each other.</p>
          <P class="doublespace">Myles continually upsets the distinctions between 
            public selves and private sexual lives, and she employs the fluidity 
            and shifts of poetry to render one’s movement into the other. Her 
            work suggests that even though images and talk of “sex” permeates 
            our public lives, the lines between public and private are continually 
            redrawn and implicitly insisted upon, particularly for women and those 
            whose sexualities diverge from heterosexual norms. The first line 
            of “We the Living” (1995) develops, plays upon, and deliberately subverts 
            the public and political language of the title: </p>

            splayed on the vivid couch. (107, 1-6). </div>

      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">For Myles, the body and sex are inextricable 
            from writing. In a talk entitled “The Lesbian Poet”(1997), Myles states 
            that “she came out as a poet and a dyke in one reading”(123) and goes 
            on to underscore the importance of the woman’s body to her poetry: 
            “It’s my poetic dilemma, it seems. To include the body, mine, the 
            woman’s as I see it, to approach the blood as part of the score”(130). 
          </p>
          <P class="doublespace">In post-Stonewall poetry, Myles developed what 
            Schuyler had begun: to acknowledge the quotidian dimension of sexuality 
            and the ecceity of homosexual identity.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [6] </span></a> In <i>The Morning of the Poem</i> (1980)<i>, 
            </i>for example, notice how gracefully Schuyler weaves together desire, 
            different forms of looking and intention, and the practice of painting. 
            The sexuality demonstrated in one sort of seeing is weaved into other 
            lines of sight: </p>

        <div class=Section1> 
          <P class="doublespace">Myles’s work is dedicated to Schuyler’s, but 
            it is a dedication free to diverge. “Chelsea Girls” exemplifies the 
            fact that Myles brings her own sexuality, and her body, a woman’s 
            “as [she] sees it” to the scene of his influence. Her honest, unveiled 
            representations of sexuality and sex are not an intrusion into the 
            thickly lit, absorptive spaces of Schuyler’s lyrics; her work continues 
            in the direction Schuyler hoped his work would take. In “A photograph” 
            (1974), Schuyler writes about “two sorts” of ecstasy: the sexual kind 
            — “my strange scream/ last Friday night” and the tender, domestic 
            kind: “’Why, that joy I felt/ and didn’t think about/ when his feet 
            were in/ my lap” (186, 27-30). Reflecting on whether he believes in 
            the “perfectibility of man,” Schuyler writes </p>

            &nbsp;Myles has pointed out to me that the “subjective, delicate states” 
            Guest rightly finds in Schuyler’s work is also applicable to film, 
            photography, video, performance, and even animation. She cites Bill 
            Viola, the video artist, as someone who “moves through those states 
            and more.” Many thanks to Eileen Myles for her generosity and enthusiastic 
            help on this essay.</span></p>

            All of Schuyler’s poems cited in this essay are taken from <i>Collected 
            Poems </i>(New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1993). After each 
            cited poem, I refer to the publication date of the collection in which 
            the poem first appeared. The cited page number refers to the place 
            where the poem appears in the <i>Collected Poems.</i></span></p>

            In her comments on this piece, Myles writes: “I wonder if . . . the 
            dialogue snapping between selves is important. The mise-en-scène of 
            the dialogue itself is a thing I probably learned from Jimmy, or advanced 
            his use of or something. But its another sort of blurring . . .”</span></p>

            See Myles’s essay “The End of New England,” in the recently published 
            collection of poetry and prose entitled <i>on my way </i>(Cambridge, 
            MA: Faux Press, 2001).</span></p>

            Responding to the word “ordinary,” and the idea of “ordinariness” 
            in Schuyler’s work, Myles suggests “ecceity”: “I also thought of ‘ecceity’ 
            so I hand it to you, because J’s ordinary all-overness seems greater 
            than ordinary. Chris Kraus gave me ecceity as a concept, a tingling 
            ubiquity.”</span></p>
