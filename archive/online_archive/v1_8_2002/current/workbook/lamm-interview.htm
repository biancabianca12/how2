      Lamm (</b><b>March 21, 2001)</b></P>
  
        <div class=Section1>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> You’ve written frankly about sex, 
            and I think <i>Skies</i> (2001)<i> </i>is interesting because it seems 
            less about sexuality or sex than sensuality, and a sensuality that isn’t 
            tied to a particular person or even act. Is that part of your understanding 
            of <i>Skies</i>?</p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> Yea. I often think of sex writing 
            — whatever that is — in relation to something like dance movies, where 
            there is a little plot going on, and then people break into a dance. 
            Later when I saw porn, I thought oh, that’s the same structure. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">I think a lot can cover sex. In a way, you can 
            be writing about the sky. When I look at the book later I thought oh 
            my god, this is all about my relationship that I was in then, which 
            I talk about more as the book progresses. There were a number things 
            going on in that book, but one was to have a big project in a space 
            that was all my own. So I think <i>Skies </i>is driven by the same desire 
            as any other project. </p>
          <P class="doublespace"><i>Cool for You</i> (2000)<i> </i>doesn’t really 
            have a lot of sex in it. I don’t know if you’ve read that. <i>Chelsea 
            Girls</i> (1997) is of course loaded with sex. One book, <i>Maxfield 
            Parrish</i> (1995), had tons of sex in it.<i> </i>My next book of poems 
            will have quite a lot of sex in it. It isn’t even that the sex comes 
            and goes, but writing about it does. Sometimes it seems like an interesting 
            thing to do, and sometimes it doesn’t even seem to be on the map. </p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> Didn’t you teach a seminar at 
            Pratt that focused on writing about sex? I think you taught the work 
            of Dodie Bellamy and Colette. </p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> Whenever I teach fiction or poetry, 
            I always make sex a specific assignment because I think it is the most 
            interesting. As a student, I was never asked to write about sex. And 
            then, to figure out if you should do that or not, because often you 
            could write something and have sex occur outside the room of the story, 
            and still have it be in the story.</p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> I read something in which you 
            discuss sex as an interesting way to tell time. &nbsp;</p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> I think in the early nineties it 
            was the only narrative that anyone I knew believed in. It seemed like 
            it was the last story, and it is a story that could be endlessly interrupted 
            and still told at the time. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">And of course, what does sex mean in terms of female 
            time and male time? Are we all having the same sex? Whether we’re having 
            sex with the same sex or the opposite sex, what is going on here? I 
            think that a lot of our sense of what narrative is and what drive is 
            has to do with the male sexual experience. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">I think when you look at the work of Virginia Woolf, 
            you ask is this a female sexual drive? That’s why I see <i>The Hours</i> 
            (1998)<i> </i>by Michael Cunningham as a failure. He was just doing 
            Virginia Woolf, but to no point. I think it was a guy using the greatest 
            woman writer of the twentieth century to describe his own homosexuality, 
            or to make her sex cover his sex, but what she was trying to do with 
            time and language I think probably had its roots in female sexuality. 
            He just imitated it, but it meant nothing. Underneath there was no there 
            there. </p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> Speaking of guys and girls. Alice 
            Notley identified herself as a girl, or at least did in her work. She 
            talked about girl poets and guy poets. When I was studying <i>Skies, 
            </i>your small pieces really reminded me of some of the small, almost 
            epigrammic poems in <i>At Night the States</i> (1976), written after 
            the death of Ted Berrigan. Do you still discover their influence on 
            your work? </p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> More than anything they were friends. 
            I was in Alice’s workshop two years after I came to New York. I think 
            Alice taught me how to be a student of writing, but she taught me how 
            to teach more than she taught me how to write. She was a great teacher, 
            and as a teacher, she always made it really clear that she was always 
            a student. She was always setting up situations that would produce writing. 
            Alice was in an endless workshop with herself as a writer. I still find 
            that in her books: she sets up an experiment, and drives it into the 
            ground. Her books are amazing and so excessive. I think she’s a master<b>. 
            </b>I always find plenty that I love, and plenty that I don’t like in 
            everything she does, and yet what I love is that she always has the 
            nerve to create a situation that produces writing. </p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> Like the Robert Mitchum persona 
            in her new book <i>Disobedience</i> (2001)?<i> </i>&nbsp;</p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> Yea. It is often really maddening. 
            She’s unstoppable. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">I certainly learned things from Alice, but Alice 
            herself would say that Eileen is not my student per se. I was fairly 
            close to her age, but I was of a different generation, and Alice would 
            lord that over me. But she was trying to get us to do something, and 
            I was trying to do something else, and there was sort of an argument 
            between us that I think to this day would persist with us as writers, 
            and that argument’s formed me, so sure, she’s an influence. </p>
          <P class="doublespace">I think Ted’s <i>Sonnets</i> (1967)<i> </i>are 
            the finest poems ever written. It’s just a masterpiece. Alice’s early 
            work, the work she wrote while I was in her workshop, probably influenced 
            me more than any other, a book called <i>Alice Ordered Me to be Made</i> 
            (1976)<i>. </i>It used the language of her then baby sons. Talk about 
            time. She used motherhood as a form to blow through as a poet. She occupied 
            the space of motherhood as an avant-garde poet. She did something that 
            men could have done, but wouldn’t or didn’t. I really feel like she 
            made something new in that moment. &nbsp;</p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> Particularly in the way she focused 
            her attention. There’s the poem in which she lists her son’s comics, 
            and there’s another poem in which she transcribes the language of her 
            son talking to a fork. There’s been so much poetry about women’s experiences 
            as mothers, but I’ve never seen that kind of attention to the oddities 
            of that world. </p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> Right, and I think it is because 
            she was there. In this workshop last night, someone wrote a really great 
            poem, and it was a very easy-seeming poem, but of course it was beautiful 
            and complex the more you looked at it, but it made you really notice 
            what an assemblage a poem is, an assemblage of exactly what is there. 
            You’re in this place, and then suddenly things start changing, and you 
            put things together as fast as they are occurring. I feel like that’s 
            the incredible awareness Alice brought to everywhere she’s been, but 
            particularly to motherhood. She was in front of these kids growing in 
            language and she made a poem out of that, which is so much more interesting 
            than say — how boring — all those poets teaching in the schools. They 
            say: here’s a poem my kid in school wrote. Whenever anybody is teaching 
            kids poetry, you always have to listen to those poems. But Alice hit 
            something much more rudimentary, which was to make poetry out of the 
            kids’ speech. </p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> You have this idea of writing 
            as notating your own mortality, which I think connects your work to 
            Notley’s in another way. In both your work and Notley’s there’s this 
            tension between the strength of the writer’s persona and its dissolution. 
            There’s the Notley poem entitled “Poem” (<i>Selected Poems, </i>23) 
            in which she describes St. Marks Place through the inevitability of 
            her absence and asserts her importance as a poet. I read <i>Skies</i> 
            in a related way, as a notation of mortality. </p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen: </b>Yea, I think there are a lot of 
            feelings of mortality in that book. I think that is part of what you 
            get when you go into nature. I started to have that experience a few 
            years ago, and started to understand how you could be in it. I guess 
            being in New York is being in it too, but its different when its water 
            and trees instead of concrete, and it lets itself get imprinted on your 
            poem. That’s what I mean about unwriting: letting the details write 
            you in a way, not really thinking about a void you write into with your 
            consciousness, but it is this weird dance of absence and presence.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span
  class=MsoEndnoteReference> [1] </span></a> It is more like 
            you are allowing the poem to happen, and nature is incredibly sad in 
            this way, identical to the way a life is sad. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">Being of the 
            age when a lot of my friends — a few very close friends — but many friends 
            died of AIDS in the late eighties and early nineties. When that stopped 
            happening, some other people just died. Then there was that feeling, 
            when is it going to stop? And then it was like “Oh No!” I was forty 
            and now I’m fifty: this is what happens. You’re like this tree — it’s 
            so corny to say — all the leaves start to fall, and then you fall. This 
            is all part of a thing that I am in, and it never stops. When you’re 
            standing in the middle of an autumnal forest you can’t miss it. It is 
            beautiful to think about — you are those things. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            In the interview with Edward Foster, you made a great formulation about 
            men and women and the public/private divide. You said, “Men are distracted 
            and disturbed, too, but there’s something about being female and walking 
            down the street…There’s a privacy in public women do not have, and I 
            think a lot of my desires to be masculine are desires to be…In fact 
            the vast majority of my poetic models are men, and I am really interested 
            in public poetry and a private person’s public nature” (60). </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">I read <i>Skies 
            </i>as a private text, and a person’s private relation to death, but 
            now that I am listening to you talk, I am reminded how public death 
            is.</span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            In a way people keep dying after they die. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            In the poem “Inauguration Day” (2001) you write that the snow “gives 
            me time / to think, to vote / for the future of everyone” (lines 61-63). 
            I thought this was a nice way to think about the poet in public world 
            but also in the private lives of people. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            When one is an individual and starts to make some peace with the notion 
            that you too will die, once that starts to be clear, you realize other 
            people will continue to work. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">One of the things 
            that is really important to me, and really disturbing in terms of men 
            and women and poetry is that so often when a guy is remembered on a 
            back of a book, it is always men validate men, and men carry on other 
            men’s work, when in fact I am influenced by that canon and I am carrying 
            on Jimmy Schuyler’s work, and I am carrying on Frank O’Hara’s work, 
            and I am carrying on John Weiner’s work. I am part of that lineage. 
            </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">So often when 
            guys creates lineages it is a guys’ lineage, and I am supposed to carry 
            on Alice’s work, and I am, but I am also carrying on Ted’s. We really 
            need to change our sense of lineage in big ways. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">You look at the 
            New York School and its all these guys and a woman, and subsequent generations 
            of men change their mind about who that woman was, no matter who that 
            woman was. <i>An Anthology of New York Poetry </i>(1970) came out and 
            the young guys who edited it didn’t like Barbara Guest’s work, so they 
            took it out and put in Bernadette Mayer. The female place is always 
            disposable. As long as that’s true, there’s no parity between male and 
            female poets. It’s like, women can have their place over here, and even 
            if women are in male poetry establishments, if you keep looking at it, 
            female poets are still<b> </b>getting rewarded by men, not for being 
            the great female poets, but being the female poets who are the most 
            feminine, or the most supportive of men, or women who already have lots 
            of power in the male establishment. You don’t see women being honored 
            for writing work that really changes things for women. I don’t mean 
            that the work has to be full of feminist statements, but just a kind 
            of an edgy reality, which is what it means to be female in the world. 
            </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            You have said similar things about men and mourning for AIDS: men mourning 
            men, and speaking for men. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            There’s a moment there when the ranks get very tight, and it is very 
            easy for a female mourner to be out. When Tim Dlugos died, the guys 
            swamped in and wrote all the introductions to the books, and I’m glad 
            David Trinidaid edited <i>Powerless</i> (1996)<b> </b>and <i>Strong 
            Place</i> (1992) but I couldn’t believe the lack of women’s names in 
            the introduction to the life of a guy who had so many female friends. 
            He was one of my best friends, and there’s no evidence that I even knew 
            him. When there was the event for Joe Brainard at PS1, and he had a 
            lot of female friends, and there were a few women there: me, Ann Lauterbach, 
            and not many gay men. A lot happens when a poet dies in terms of how 
            they get re-written. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            Thinking about mourning and men and people on the way to dying. I am 
            obsessed with the short story “Chelsea Girls” (1997). I was thinking 
            about this story in terms of your work carrying on his influence. Did 
            Schuyler’s work help make the sexuality of your work possible? </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            Well, he had a great deal of comfort about being an out gay man in his 
            work. He was finishing <i>The Morning of the Poem</i> (1981) when I 
            first started to work with him. His social style was always an enactment 
            of it. I would come tell him about last night, and he would talk about 
            the old days. Poetry is gossip. He really liked that I was a dyke. It 
            was very entertaining for him, and in an odd way he was even proud of 
            it. It was kind of a familial thing. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">There was a bratty 
            pleasure when I wrote “Chelsea Girls” because I thought that to write 
            a story, you had to wait a few years, and that had been my pattern with 
            fiction, but I wrote that right after Jimmy died. I made myself do it. 
            I had a feeling that I should get right to it. I set up a whole situation. 
            I used to have a different arm chair in this apartment that was <i>my 
            chair</i>, and I threw a yellow legal pad next to it and I just made 
            a deal with myself because I didn’t have what it usually took to write 
            a story, but I was hell-bent on writing the story, so I decided that 
            I would write it like a poem. I have a much more fragmented sense of 
            how to write a poem, so every time I would come in the door I would 
            sit down and get to the next place in the story. So I wrote it in this 
            raggedy way, and the story immediately allowed for separate rooms. But 
            also, I thought if I’m being his female memoirist, then I am going to 
            get some pussy in there. I am going to put something in here that gay 
            men might not want to hear about — Jimmy would have been fine, he was 
            always saying dirty things to me as part of our joke, “Did you get any 
            pussy last night Eileen?” — but say other members of his generation 
            wouldn’t be that way. I was getting the shape of my own friendship in 
            by making sure that my own lesbian history was neck and neck with my 
            reverence for this man, so I wouldn’t be erasing myself as I was memorializing 
            him. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">I love that form 
            can be so practical. That you can decide that there are two prongs of

            Was <i>Cool for You </i>written before or after <i>Skies</i>?</span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen: </b>They 
            were written at the same time. &nbsp;</span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            <i>Skies </i>seems like a compression of your voice and imagery, and 
            <i>Cool for You</i> seems to be an opening out of your persona and your 
            story. Did you find a real distinction between writing prose and poetry? 
            </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            One of the things about writing a book of prose is that you are really 
            in it. It is kind of gross. It is like being buried alive in a way. 
            Once you know you have a book going, you kind of feel like you are never 
            free in a horrible way. So then poetry becomes kind of an escape — you 
            get to go out and breathe. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">I didn’t think 
            I was writing poems when I started <i>Skies. </i>I just saw the glorious 
            sky in P-town, and I was thinking I would write another collection of 
            short stories called <i>Skies. </i>The only thing that would make the 
            stories linked was that I would write all the sky stuff in between. 
            I would figure out some architecture to make that work. So that was 
            the idea and I just started writing the skies…</span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly: 
            </b>The architecture became the plane in the poems. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            Yea, that’s interesting, because a lot of things happen in them<b>. 
            </b>Yeah, the planes link it; it’s true. I just never wrote the stories. 
            So I got deeper into <i>Cool for You, </i>but once I realized what I 
            was doing, that I was writing poems, I could really say the poems are 
            this, and the novel is this, and they really were in separate places. 
            But also when you are writing a lot of fiction, or something that has 
            narrative, then poetry doesn’t have to do that. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">Towards the end 
            of <i>Skies</i>, it seemed like it was time to put the people back, 
            because I felt I had gone so far out in writing there weren’t people 
            in my poems. In the new poems that I’m writing now seem much more narrative 
            and human; there’s much more of a connection between people in them, 
            which is a different relationship. <i>Skies </i>is a relationship — 
            about a poet and nature, and the other is a relation between people. 
            </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            It seems that your work as a poet helped you know where and when to 
            begin and end a narrative. I am always surprised how your stories open 
            and close, and I thought that perhaps this is the case because you were 
            a poet first. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            The gap between chapters and paragraphs is so interesting. As poets 
            we know it so well for a lot of reasons, but one of them is giving poetry 
            readings. You’ve got a half an hour to fill. I remember Larry Fagin 
            saying a million years ago — was it him? — you should be going in with 
            humor and going out with beauty. People do stuff like that, you really 
            have to open the audience up and make people feel comfortable to go 
            through all these rises and falls, but you’re really aware of structuring 
            some time publicly when you’re assembling a poetry reading. You read 
            a poem, and now the room feels this way. So what can I put into that 
            space that will keep the energy going? I really felt like I used those 
            kind of principals when I was arranging the book. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly: 
            </b>Can you read an audience as well as you think you can when you are 
            standing right there in front of them?</span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            There’s always paranoia. There are so many different kinds of quiet: 
            the quiet attentive, the quiet bored, the quiet dissatisfied, the quiet 
            in awe. Patter helps. I’ve gotten better at doing that because I read 
            a lot. You can tell who they are by what they respond to when you speak 
            almost more than when you read the poem. Pretending they’re there when 
            I’m writing keeps my fingers moving. They are me, of course. When you’re 
            writing the audience is just paranoia. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            In a talk which you gave at St. Marks in 1994 entitled “The Lesbian 
            Poet,” and reprinted in <i>School of Fish</i> (1997), you say: “I think 
            we write all our poems with our metabolism, our sexuality, for me a 
            poem has always been an imagined body of a sort, getting that down in 
            time, it moves this way and that, it is full of its own sense of possibility” 
            (124). I think you’ve already answered this, but I am curious what the 
            imagined body of prose writing is? Is it your own corpse, being buried 
            alive? </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            No, well, in a way, I think the body vanishes in prose, and I’ve always 
            felt this as both as a reader and a writer. As a prose writer, you sit 
            down at the computer or whatever and you start to go and you create 
            a situation. At a certain point, you evacuate, and when you’re lost 
            in prose, you’re gone. It’s a virtual leap into this other world that 
            truly exists. Same as a reader, you get lost in a book.</span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">I think poetry 
            isn’t about getting lost. It is much more about scoring the plane of 
            existence that you’re dwelling in. I often think — and I have been drawing 
            away from this a little bit — that poetry is a human form; I really 
            want the body to be there in the real time of the writing. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            In “The Lesbian Poet” (<i>School of Fish</i>, 1994), you describe coming 
            out as a dyke and a poet during your first poetry reading. Could you 
            talk more about sexuality and textuality (or even performativity) becoming 
            synonymous or coincident for you? </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            I think it is about energy. When I had a card I hadn’t played as a person, 
            so there was something I wanted to do that I hadn’t done yet — once 
            I started to think that I would do it, or was doing it, or this was 
            a possibility. Then I began to realize in a very profound way, one could 
            be wedded to movement. Also, I operated in a very conservative way. 
            I came to New York and thought I would do something I hadn’t done in 
            Boston, without even knowing what that was. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">It is weird to 
            say but I felt like I needed to earn my poetry cards first. I hung around 
            for a couple years, and was part of the gang and stuff. I think by the 
            time I was part of the St. Marks scene and I got my first Wednesday 
            night reading there, in the fall of ’77, I was in love with a girl for 
            the first time and willing to say so and willing to write about it, 
            and it just seemed like some wonderful new operation started to occur 
            in my poems at that time too. There was a limitation of energy that 
            I didn’t have to work with anymore. I felt I had a much more expansive 
            frame to move with. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            There are many great moments in <i>Cool for You</i>, but one I found 
            particularly touching came about early in the book, when Eileen is chosen 
            to be Mrs. Lesters’ teacher’s helper at the Fidelity house, where she 
            has been taking and excelling at her art lessons, particularly drawing. 
            Eileen decides not to become the teachers’ assistant because her father 
            has died, and she wants to get a job and be responsible for her mom. 
            You write: “I remember the day I told Mrs. Lester. I was really afraid. 
            I thought she would be mad, and miss me. She looked at me nervously. 
            Okay Dear if that’s what you want to do. I walked down the street crying, 
            walking home. I wondered what being her helper would have been like. 
            I swung my bag. Let the babies help themselves. Art is for kids” (33). 
            There are so many complicated feelings compressed into this perfectly 
            discrete narrative moment. I also like the fact that the writing was 
            thoroughly invested in and absorbed in the emotions of <i>that</i> moment, 
            for that girl who just lost her dad. It was filtered through the adult 
            narrator’s memory, but not explicitly. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            I have started to notice when I read memoirs and first-person narratives 
            that when the writer goes into the narration they stop being the kid 
            and they become the adult. I just feel there is something inauthentic 
            about that. Shouldn’t the kid be doing all the jobs? And aren’t you 
            pushed more, language wise, to figure out how the kid really sees her 
            reality? To not drop the mask of the kid ever, but to stay in there, 
            and try and figure out how she puts a bookcase together or a room together, 
            how the kid goes out the door, and what eating is, make all the details 
            of the reality seen through the kid’s eyes. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">

          <P class="doublespace">In Susan Minot’s 
            new book <i>Rapture </i>(2002), there’s a moment where two lovers are 
            walking into a hotel room and she knows he has a girlfriend back in 
            New York, and as they are walking into the hotel room, the phone rings, 
            and she urges him to pick it up, and he picks it up, and says “Honey” 
            and the narrator’s heart drops. It’s that cold-blooded ability to change 
            selves. We’ve all seen that moment in different ways, and a person’s 
            ability to change sides is a little too creepy.</p>
          <P class="doublespace">And I feel this 
            in fiction, and I think this could be in some way posturing. I like 
            the myth of the true self, which is being constructed throughout the 
            book, in all places, and it’s a construction of course, but I just feel 
            there’s something loyal and good and true when a writer make the one 
            perspective do all the work, rather than watch that bourgeois accommodation 
            occur: the always returning to that conscious control, the middle. I 
            hate that. </span></p>

            </b>I am curious about how you see your work within the tradition of 
            American literature, particularly since you grew up from Massachusetts…</span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            There’s this whole thing of “Massachusetts” in Massachusetts. It’s kind 
            of gross because in a way it is no place because it is so hung up on 
            its past, despite the fact that Massachusetts is working class, i.e. 
            pretty recent immigrants are living there who have nothing to do with 
            that past — the people who came to the country and still own it, and 
            then of course there’s the black community was brought there in chains. 
            Yet there are all these old houses and there is that strange aura about 
            all that old American history, and growing up around it that and you 
            can’t help measuring yourself against it. That’s part of the monstrousness 
            of Massachusetts. There’s that creepy detail I know I used in the book. 
            It’s so weird to realize that the people who were forced out of Ireland 
            by starvation were in fact forced by ancestors of the same people they 
            would come and be servants to. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">But I love the 
            idea, and I’m very wedded to the idea of being an American poet. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">The whole Donald 
            Allen mid-twentieth-century poetry movement was the first wave of the 
            inheritors of William Carlos Williams’ idea that this was an American 
            language and that they were writing in it. It has a variable foot, and 
            it’s erratic. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">It is my own 
            belief that this is a violent country, and it’s a violent language that 
            we write and speak in and to pretend to that it’s otherwise…That’s why 
            I am not interested in writing a literary language and I’m a little 
            bit adamant about that<b>. </b>I want to be broken and I am broken. 
            </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">Class is so fluid. 
            We were working-class, or lower-middle class, but my mother wanted us 
            to speak better, and she was a child of immigrants. Polish was her first 
            language. She really wanted us to speak correctly, and yet there was 
            so much more adventure available with the kids next door who spoke pretty 
            bad English. We wanted to speak like them, because speaking like them 
            meant you could move like them and go where they went. I think there’s 
            a way in which the only people who don’t put their past behind them 
            are ruling class white men who happen to speak the language of power, 
            and all the rest of us are supposed to hide that for them, or hide behind 
            that with them. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">There’s accommodation 
            for Black English, because we — the liberal white culture — want to 
            make sure Black people can become literate and that means allowing them 
            speak the way they speak and calling that a language too, but to not 
            to extend that same openness to other Englishes seems weird and even 
            telling — that the whole thing’s the fraud. </span></p>

            The thing that wound up being really strange and interesting was that 
            I in fact learned a lot from the state. I had to go to volunteer lawyers 
            from the arts to figure out how to get my records from the state of 
            Massachusetts and then my brother, because he lived in the state of 
            Massachusetts, had to sign the papers. It was interesting. It was though 
            I wasn’t enough of a Myles to get Nellie’s papers, I had to get my brother 
            Terry Myles in there. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">But what I learned 
            from those records is that the state had, in a certain way, preserved

            of my dad that I had never seen. I never thought of my brother as this 
            twenty-three year old unemployed guy living at home. So, there’s this 
            weird way in which the state preserves too. </span></p>

            something also beautiful about it too. And I started to realize that 
            it was the place we went to the most, and there were more pictures of 
            us with her at the Westborough State Hospital than there is of us anywhere 
            else. I used the solar system as a metaphor in <i>Cool for You</i> a 
            lot and Nellie was the sun, and remained the sun, and when she died, 
            my dad died four years after she did. It was so weird that she managed

            Pain” (<i>Maxfield Parrish</i>, 1995), and the essay “How I Wrote a 
            Certain of My Poems” (<i>Not Me</i>, 1991), which describes the inspiration 
            and the making of “Romantic Pain.” You mentioned the World Trade Towers 
            in “Romantic Pain.” You write that they are “immensely quiet and barely 
            / lit” (lines 26-27). How has the focus you have brought to New York 
            changed? What interests you about writing about New York since September 
            11<sup>th</sup>? </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            I have totally mixed feelings. I get mad at projects that are about 
            our response to September 11<sup>th</sup>. There’s something strange 
            about anything or anybody trying to coordinate our responses. I still 
            feel like…God, where were <i>you</i><b> </b>that day? </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            I was in bed, and my mom, who lives on the West coast, saw it on the 
            news before I did and she called me. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            I was in bed in too. I still feel like the pieces are still coming back 
            together. In some weird way…I don’t love that it happened, it’s a tragedy…but 
            I love that it makes me know how connected I am to the place where I 
            live. It’s like we’ve all returned in a certain way, but not the same 
            way; we’ll never return in the same way. What’s possible for life in 
            New York is forever altered. That little thought and feeling comes to 
            all of us at different times. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">I love going 
            through the winter and the spring with my friends and the people I barely 
            know and reminding myself how weirdly we needed each other and kept 
            coming into contact. It just made me more aware than ever of what a 
            human city New York is. I feel oddly patriotic about the glob of humanness 
            that we are all. I love being a part of that and thinking that it’s 
            the language that I speak. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">I think I have 
            written one poem officially about it. I was going out with Jordana<b>,</b> 
            to have dinner with friends in Brooklyn and we were driving and we were 
            stopping off at delis, buying water and flowers. You know how it is 
            at night, the flowers in delis are all lit, and they start to get wilder 
            and wilder looking, and the flowers change throughout the year. It’s 
            so funny that we know what season it is by the flowers being sold in 
            New York. I was aware of all that, and I just felt sad that people wouldn’t 
            see this happen. The poem ended with “We miss you.” So it was a buried 
            mourning poem. The people seemed like the flowers — not to beat the 
            metaphor — but it expressed a particular kind of sadness for the people 
            who wouldn’t make it home. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> The other thing about “’Romantic 
            Pain’” I am interested in: that great moment in which you’re smoking 
            a cigarette — I think it is in the Staten Island Ferry bathroom — there 
            are two other women there, and you see the three of you from above, 
            looking at yourselves in the mirror: “I can see us from overhead / and 
            call the configuration ‘Feminism’” (lines 69-70) Do you see feminism 
            differently now? Particularly since you went on tour with Sister Spit?<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> 
            [5] </a></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            I know some people who were deeply into the second wave of feminism 
            as writers and artists, and maybe I was too young or not in the right 
            class. I didn’t really play in that field of feminism. There never seemed 
            to be a culture of feminism. It may have been there but it didn’t have 
            an impact on me. I wasn’t affected by the art of feminism. I wasn’t 
            affected by the poetry of feminism.  I didn’t think it even created 
            new styles. But what I am really aware that there’s just this fucking 
            incredible young female culture in visual art, music, writing, and dance, 
            that seems to be the strongest culture that I know of — male or female. 
            I saw Le Tigre in Portland last week. The new record<i>, Feminist Sweepstakes, 
            </i>has really great lyrics. I just had someone burn me a copy, but 
            I think I am going to buy it so I can read the lyrics. It’s wonderful 
            poetry, and its very Ra-ra feminism. They have videos and movies behind 
            them when they perform, and so they were projecting the lyrics to the 
            songs onto the screen too. And Kathleen Hanna would say, “we’re doing 
            radical feminist karaoke,” and getting the audience to scream back the 
            lines, and the lines were really bold great female poetry — just fun 
            and cool. I just saw that as something I had never really seen before. 
            It was politics and aesthetics. Who could be more rock-n-roll than Kathleen 
            Hanna? This was not girl’s rock. It just wasn’t a separate category. 
            </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            I began with frankness, so I think I’ll end there. You are frank about 
            the relationship between class and language. Holland Cotter quotes you 
            saying, “You know so much about people from the second they open their 
            mouths. Right away you might know that you might want to keep them out. 
            So when I write, I want to keep changing the locks, saying the ‘wrong’ 
            thing when I’m doing the right thing.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> 
            [6] </a> I am intrigued by this intersection of “right” 
            and “wrong” in the poem. Can a poem bring the voice into the cultural 
            hierarchy that poetry often signifies and also maintain an explicit 
            resistance to that hierarchy?</span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            Is there one implicit hierarchy or is there a series of them? I feel 
            like part of what a poem is doing is jumbling codes. What we were talking 
            about in terms of the jumps fiction or poetry readings can make, poems 
            make those jumps line to line. You don’t want to do it so much that 
            nobody can follow you, but it is interesting just when you have created 
            a certain kind of gestalt to slide into another one. Or, just when you 
            think you’ve written a <i>New Yorker</i> poem, put some pussy in. Sexual 
            language keeps being attractive because it changes the register so radically. 
            It has so much power — obviously — to open the doors to one room, and 
            close the doors to another. It is a living architecture of consciousness. 
            </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace">I want to be 
            challenged as a human being in terms of how many kinds people I can 
            be, how many ways I can be open, how many adjustments I can make. You 
            have to, just to exist in the day. Everyday is this crazy little jungle 
            gym of adjustments just to keep your sanity and keep functioning, and 
            keep receiving messages and sending messages. I love the idea that a 
            poem can do that. So it’s a little map of consciousness that says: this 
            is what it is like to be alive. </span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
            I wanted to finish with the essay “The End of New England,” in <i>on 
            my way</i>. You focus on the way your sister leaves out the “p” of napkin, 
            and you express longing for what your sister left out: “My sister said 
            ‘nakin’ she adamantly dropped the p, I miss her, I miss my family, it 
            was another way to say us. Nakin” (69). Do you see language as home?</span></p>
          <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
            Oh yeah. Absolutely, completely and utterly. I took a trip to Russia 
            in 1995, and I swear I almost had a nervous breakdown because I couldn’t 
            be received in the way that I always had been. It was such an identity 
            loss, and I so wanted to come home. And really, I wanted to be home 
            in my language. </span></p>
