              air introducing thin air spoiled yet following.</p>
            <p>Resumed, she stumbles.  Row after row of birch shimmer mystery.

              Elongated shadow announces a hesitating solidity.  Bridge forcing<br>
              itself across, she knows what it is to be drenched and pulled under.  
              <br>
              And she crosses, moving past mothers with carriages, couples.  <br>
