      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My process: Two events conspired toward the creation 
        of <i>Into Stillness</i>, my visit to Budapest, the closest I’d ever gotten 
        to my paternal grandparent’s home, and the death a few months later of 
        my 98-year-old grandmother. With her passing went the stories she never 
        told about the loss of her family and her husband’s family, my family, 
        to Nazism. How did their tragedy influence my reluctance to embrace religion 
        and state my spiritual beliefs?&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I didn’t want an autobiographical work though, well 
        aware that atrocities driven by racial and religious conflict occur daily 
        across the globe. I read numerous accounts of survivors and the ongoing 
        struggles with the trauma they carry daily, and my interest turned toward 
        the sacredness of the body as a home. This belief and much of my current 
        writing style derives from years of dancing Contact Improvisation, a modern 
        improvisational dance, and meditation, both rooted in the ever-shifting 
        moment and the felt and fleeting self.&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In my previous book, <i>Uncommon Grammar Cloth</i>, 
        each word arises from my body like sweat, riding on breath, pulse, pause, 
        and play, avoiding, to a degree, linear meaning. Here I wanted a similar 
        effect, but with a significant difference: a focus on disembodied places, 
        the violences that numb, the voices stifled, all balanced, even surpassed 
        by an honoring of flesh and a return to stillness.</p>

            <p>Everything passes away, I forget, I lie down. In order to die, 
              in<br>
              order of death, the passing of horizons into vertical truths.<br>
              Syllables list, key to pronouncements, to swinging in place or<br>
              standing still with every falsehood and cashmere dress. To uncloth 
              and<br>
              redress every wound and glee and neuter the dead. I am dying, I<br>
              forget. Alone with me you. You settle me down and we recite our<br>
              recriminations, the day you closed the door locked, the afternoon 
              I<br>
              spanked the monkey, the eve the moon knocked. We listen in our briefs<br>
              long. We abide the tic of your lip in perpetual twitch and my hip 
              in<br>
              swing. This we do for one another for alone. Kicking the bucket 
              and<br>
              pulling the teeth, better now than leaden, vase cracked beyond glue. 
            <p>When you lie beside mine, I am forced to remember a more truculent<br>
              bed, bumps that force the blood of truth. When you lie aside, I 
              tarry<br>
              longer in the doorway, setting my gaze on the garden, wanting to 
              pick<br>
              apart patches, to weed out the ripe. Pitted as such, but do not 
              pity<br>
              me. Bite the soft spot, but watch for pits. 
            <p>Seed me with your dying that I may remember the host. Uninvited 
              guest,<br>
              I stay, guess, speculate on material worries and accept your offer 
              of<br>
              a drink with a toast jellied with sublime. Onward, ho!  Remember 
              the<br>
              Alms! A snitch of time! We clink grasses, cut the yawns, inspire 
              and<br>
              wipe the other’s brow. 
            <p>Blame cuts across the garden, takes the path most traveled, most<br>
              averse. We sing loudly, stanzaically, prose intended for the<br>
              upper-crass. We do not mind. We do the body in order of dying, of<br>
              passing beyond lips and hip gyrations, below the wind of my stare 
              and<br>
              your thumb pointing down. Communion in community, the veil lifted,<br>
              face reviled for bounty, the many veils parting aside the robe of<br>
              matter. Robbery if anything less. Bribery if anything more suitable.<br>
              Removal of offal and awesome, disrobery. I cannot lie, nor you. 
              You<br>
              cannot pass away, ignore me. In our millennial bed below the slow<br>
              close the moon nodding off... 
            <p>&nbsp; 
            <p>This body remembers.<br>
              This body bends over backwards crosses space to embody another<br>
              reaching in stretch in grasp letting go consider caress and push. 
              In<br>
              the transgression one supposes to wink in the dilation of muscled<br>
              edges and flesh softening. This body hears voice and stomp as blocking<br>
              none too sonorous twisting from side to wide. Echo but no fall.<br>
              Opening that closes the door and lifts the window to still point 
              as<br>
              attentive ear. How is one to double? How when doubt interferes like<br>
              static during symphony like dried out during rain like kiss that 
              finds<br>
              no lips? 
            <p>This body kneels to ground and dig in hole to burrow what’s on 
              loan in<br>
              bend an afterthought into bellow. Bent knees bend needs to want 
              less<br>
              or nothing left to be rented. Buy one and all impropriety if<br>
              opportunity arises like a stalk seeking sun, like a hand seeking 
              hold.<br>
              How many times is how many times? When as how to which. In the<br>
              unseemly shadow and mostly forgiven link of blood and bone, tried 
              and<br>
              removed.  
            <p>An answer pursues a question, but misses the exit, the train of<br>
              thoughtless. 
            <p>A body rests against bark, leans forward to generate touch that<br>
              releases hold. 
            <p>When she caught her breath, she let it go. 
            <p>When her thoughts raced, she held up a clock for good measure. 
            <p>With the beat of heart, she tapped its code and understood nothing 
              as<br>
              the same as a misunderstanding or scant attempt at putting forth<br>
              what’s hidden beneath the face of appearances. Such a lowly ruse, 
              she<br>
              surmised. How slowly it dawned on her that despite any cling to 
              branch<br>
              or root that she had to dislodge and shred every evidence of prove 
              it.<br>
              The line between possible and impish delight she knew to be a hair’s<br>
              breath, insightful as a rat’s flea. Nothing beckoned in the rehearsal<br>
              that no one showed forever in interminable delay. Wait not what 
              is<br>
              wanton. A simple mistake no less than mere miscalculation. Such<br>
              equivalencies baffled unlike the thorn of scratch which left tracks 
              of<br>
              pain. But she was beyond the righteous quibble and took to walk, 
              to<br>
              sway hip and heal, to lesson the overmore between placing her beside<br>
              herself, exiled from home. She wished none such fate to none such 
              a<br>
              one because she better in knowing nothing… 
            <p>&nbsp; 
            <p>Closer to still.  
            <p>My body is sacred. Mine self be tree. Branches root toward sky<br>
              detritus. Mine body mine in the deep shaft and dark haunts with 
              drip<br>
              drip cool, inner heat helloing goodbyes and welcome my body ah. 
              Ah<br>
              body, ah. 
            <p>Abdominal rest, belly rise. The rise and set pause between crust 
              and<br>
              core, granite and silt, eons and ore. Ether or amen opens gate and<br>
              aha. One not a one alone. Two in see to the listener be tree. A 
              gain<br>
              in prone and spin every lost a gain. The spin in still, the line 
              piped<br>
              in past sealed. No dam it. No dam, yes sir-ree. Rishima. Zimzum.<br>
              Satori. Rishima. Zimzum. Satori. A mend to the ways. A mend to distill<br>
              the disquieted, trembles and quakes, explosive ferments flourishing<br>
              like weeds, rocks loosened. 
            <p>Abdominal rest, belly fall. Tree of discord twined in brilliance, 
              a<br>
              looming ray, gray with overt, avid, avoid. Mud beyond impression,<br>
              impress beyond mad. Benign quarrying, querulous, quay. Cuts into 
              her<br>
              skin cuts into mine. 
            <p>Shefa for shekina for tikkun. Not for the taking. Shefa ahem. Amen<br>
              ahem. Abdominal rest, body beside body, touch beyond tease, arrival 
              as<br>
              soon as depart, depart saming return. Aha body, ah. 
            <p>My spin stills me. Ah swears against reasons, rips away discord,<br>
              uproots the rots and desiccates the falsely inflated. Spin as lip<br>
              against cheek against breath against pronouncing the silent, crippled<br>
              and maintained, started and waned, the obvious poke and sting in<br>
              shadows that slip out from behind the curtain into neither limp 
              nor<br>
              lame nor lung blackened by shoulds but the yes of aha.
