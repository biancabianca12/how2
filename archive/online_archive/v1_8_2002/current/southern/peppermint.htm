        of the following texts have been list-making from diverse sources, homophoning 
        from those lists, and other randomizing methods of composition, for e.g., 
        “Heidi You Orange” was written by substitution within an OED entry for 
        ‘orange’ and is part of a larger project <i>Object if I </i> conceived 
        in response to Helene Cixous’ <i>To Live the Orange</i>. How to disrupt 
        the hegemonic monologism of the lyric ‘I’ and save youse a “See it?”</p>
