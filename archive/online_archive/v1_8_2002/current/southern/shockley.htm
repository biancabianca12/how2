      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Two of these poems (“you can say that again, billie” 
        and “Miles’s Muse”) were written during the experience of intense listening 
        to the songs they reference. The first one names Billie Holiday as the 
        singer (and she is often credited with writing the lyrics), but in fact 
        it is Cassandra Wilson’s rendition that I hear as the backdrop to the 
        poem, which also references my favorite Faulkner novel, <i>Absalom! Absalom!</i> 
        I wrote the poem about Miles Davis and Cicely Tyson as a way of redeeming 
        my endless enjoyment of his work, by interrogating its relationship to 
        my anger over his treatment of the actor I so admire. The third, “poem 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;for when his arms open&nbsp;&nbsp; so wide&nbsp;&nbsp; you 
        fall through,” began as a prose poem, but that form seemed far too coherent 
        to represent the kind of disconnect that is the subject of the work. I 
        played with the lines until I arrived at a form that could be read in 
        a variety of ways/directions, none of which is the “right” way. The “meditation” 
        is the poem I had always stopped myself from writing, because it felt 
        too scary. I wanted the flow (and unflow) of words across the page to 
        translate something about the pace of the thoughts of the poet, as she 
        sits in Eden pondering the Fall. But please don’t let any of this stop 
        you, reader, from deciding for yourself what these poems are about.<span style='font-size:10.0pt;
