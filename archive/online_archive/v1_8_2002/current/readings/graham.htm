            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Although <i>Sun-Up and Other Poems</i>, Lola 
              Ridge’s second book, did not receive the public attention of <i>The 
              Ghetto</i>, it is nevertheless an insightful collection full of 
              diverse risk-taking — political, personal and aesthetic. Ridge moves 
              among, describes, and inhabits voices and physical cityscapes with 
              a poetic eye that is objective, yet also politically and emotionally 
              engaged.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The collection begins with a long and at least 
              semi-autobiographical poem called “Sun-Up.” The lyric “I” speaks 
              alternately in the voice of a child full of nouns, and as an adult 
              retrospectively addressing the child it once was. Ridge grew up 
              in immigrant neighborhoods, and this is the world depicted. In one 
              of the most brutal moments of the poem, the child-“I” becomes aware 
              of class distinctions through a violent encounter, while at the 
              same time the voice of the mature poet reflects:</p>

              <div class=Section1>Jude and I<br>
                were weeding our garden<br>
                when we heard his whip —<br>
                must have been a new whip<br>
                to cut of dandelion-heads at one swing. . . .<br>
                He was the kind of boy you know when you had Celia. . . .<br>
                with nice clothes on and curls<br>
                crawling about his collar<br>
                like little golden slugs,<br>
                and his man was leading his horse.<br>
                I wish I hadn’t run to meet him. . .<br>
                If you hadn’t run to meet him<br>
                he mightn’t have trod on your garden and said:<br>
                Get out of my field you dirty little beggar. . .<br>
                He mightn’t have struck you with his whip. . . .</div>

        <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
          <div class=Section1> 
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While the poem describes a world of striking 
              social and economic inequality, that same world is also the domain 
              of a child, and much of the poem’s language dwells on the mother, 
              friends, and a doll. At times the poem reads like a nursery rhyme: 
              “Moon catches the flying fish / as they dive in the bay / Flying 
              fish / spin over and over / slippity-silver / into the water.” Other 
              times it is psychologically observant: “You look in the eyes of 
              grown-up people / to see if they feel / the way you feel… / but 
              they hide inside of themselves, / and so you do not find out.” The 
              combination of multiple voices, physical language, and political 
              and emotional awareness makes “Sun-up” an impressive autobiographical 
              poem which does far more than narrate the childhood of Lola Ridge.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The rest of the book is divided into six other 
              sections, of which “windows” and “Reveille” are (for this reviewer) 
              especially interesting. “Time-Stone,” the first poem in “Windows” 
              begins “Hallo, Metropolitan — / Ubiquitous windows staring all ways,” 
              addressing the cityscape from one of the many “ubiquitous windows” 
              overlooking the street. Other poems look out on “Small towns / Crawling 
              out of their green shirts . . .” as in “Train Window.” These poems 
              examine windows and look through windows, often onto more architecture: 
              churches or “skyscrapers . . . remote, unpartisan . . .” creating 
              a feeling of both lonely alienation and connection. Though the skyscrapers 
              are “Austerely greeting the sun,” the poet says “I know your secrets 
              . . . better than all the policemen / like fat blue mullet along 
              the avenues.” </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poems in “Reveille,” the final section 
              in the book, are explicitly political, some dedicated to Emma Goldman 
              and Alexander Berkman, editors and publishers of the journal <i>Mother 
              Earth</i> (1906-1917), and leading anarchists, who Ridge knew personally. 
              Other poems in this section focus directly on economic inequality 
              and highlight the potential power of the working class to defy their 
              subjugators:</p>

              <div class=Section1><i>Allons enfants de la patrie </i>—<br>
                Electric . . . piercing . . . shrill as a fife<br>
                the voice of a little Russian<br>
                breaks out of the shivered circle.<br>
                Another voice rises. . . another and another<br>
                leaps like flame to flame.<br>
                And life — surging, clamorous, swarming like a rabble<br>
                            crazy fluttering ragged petticoats —<br>
                comes rushing back into torpid eyes<br>
                like suddenly yielded gates  (“In Harness”)</div>

        <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
          <div class=Section1> 
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Immigrant issues (“the voice of a little Russian”), 
              gender issues (“crazy fluttering ragged petticoats”), and the plight 
              of the working class are all prominent in this poem. Thus it is 
              in this final section of the book that Ridge begins to focus more 
              explicitly on the social and economic issues that define her later 
              work. Overall <i>Sun-up and Other Poems</i> is a diverse and daring 
              collection of work by Lola Ridge, a major female poet and social 
              activist.</p>
