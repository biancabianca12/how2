        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When I requested and received my scanner, as a 
            Christmas gift, it was mostly for this; I firmly believe public domain 
            texts should be available free on the internet. Mine is a fairly common 
            attitude among people who have used the internet for a relatively long 
            time or who use the internet a great deal. I am interested in making 
            poetry written and published before 1923 by women, especially academically 
            overlooked women, available. There are certain ramifications to this, 
            of course. While not striking a blow against global capitalism in the 
            publishing industry, I would affect, negatively as well as positively, 
            the people I wanted to help: overlooked female poets and the female 
            academics who study them.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">At the time I found the first two Lola Ridge books, 
            <i>The Ghetto </i>and<i> Sun-Up</i>, originals, I was reading from and 
            circulating a list of roughly twentieth century proto-modernist or modernist 
            female poets writing in English who seemed to be overlooked. A large 
            number of these women were from the UK diaspora. Ridge was born in Dublin, 
            Ireland, raised and first married in New Zealand, and moved to New York 
            after her divorce. My list of poets was derived from a discussion on 
            the WOMPO listserv, Kim Lyons’ Poetry Project list, the <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
            archive, the Light &amp; Dust Books online anthology, and other similar 
            sources. Many of these women published before 1923, but their works 
            were unavailable online. I have scanned and uploaded, or am in the process 
            of so doing, volumes by Marjorie Allen Seiffert, Evelyn Scott, Hazel 
            Hall, Eunice Tietjens, and Genevieve Taggard. I will probably also make 
            <i>Sour Grapes</i> and <i>Kora in Hell</i> by William Carlos Williams 
            available, and for non-poetry, Vachel Lindsay’s book on film. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is important to proceed rapidly: some firms 
            are making electronic copies of public domain texts available and reserving 
            “electronic copyright.” </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Negative ramifications of online publication of 
            public domain texts include possible lower distribution of in many cases 
            long-awaited collected volumes. As-yet unplanned collected books would 
            most likely continue to be unplanned, once the works begin entering 
            the public domain. If the internet becomes a library for out of print 
            texts, as I believe it should, it would have a different effect on book 
            publishing and buying, especially in the specialized arena of poetry, 
            than library availability does, because electronic copies may be assigned 
            reading in academic courses. In fact, because I teach online, this is 
            one of my motives. It simply doesn’t make sense to have my students 
            buy physical texts. Students can print electronic books at will, rather 
            than signing up to read them at the reference desk. Further, my own 
            students, who are online, would have access to this work, which is long 
            out of print. I remember my own student poverty: I never bought any 
            of the books. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lola Ridge’s writings are scheduled to be published 
            by the University of Maine Press. The editor of this volume, <i>Collected 
            Poems: Lola Ridge</i>, Elaine Sproat, is the Ridge literary executor. 
            As an independent academic, she had also written and presented papers 
            related to her project. She also plans a biography. Her project hasn’t 
            proceeded rapidly. If establishing ownership of an overlooked writer 
            makes an academic career, here is one to be made; yet, here is one not 
            being made. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Other problems of making these volumes available 
            include distorting perceptions of these poets writings by making only 
            first books available. This concerns me a bit more than it might ordinarily 
            since, for example, I prefer the poetry in Lola Ridge’s first two published 
            books to her other work. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I began scanning <i>The Ghetto</i>. It was difficult 
            not to correct the errata and spelling. I didn’t exercise my editorial 
            pet peeves, such as not capitalizing each line, and not capitalizing 
            the first word in each poem. But these are fairly mundane considerations. 
            What was more difficult was reading and “cleaning up” the scans. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Scanning and cleaning up the scans is a completely 
            different way to read poetry. I have typed poetry to force myself to 
            read it, written it out longhand, listened to it on books on tape, made 
            readings recordings of my own poems and myself reading other poems. 
            I recommend these sorts of chores to inclined students, especially those 
            finding poems don’t reveal themselves adequately when read silently 
            or memorized. Normally I might be more interested in things which mis-scanned 
            — examples of those include “like the eyes of corn” and “inlay babies” 
            — and things I accidentally scanned more than once, such as the page 
            beginning “Life in the cramped ova.” There was plenty of pleasure in 
            the frangible pages aside from the text. It is common to note these 
            pleasures when “running down” electronic texts. Here’s my example: someone 
            had scanned this passage in blue ink (from “The Song of Iron,” 52) I 
            wouldn’t have picked out: </p>
        </div>
        <blockquote>
          <div class=Section1>/ x x / x x / x x / x<br>
            Hulks of black turbines a1l mangled and roaring,<br>
            / x x / x x / x x /<br>
            Battering egress through ramparted walls...<br>
            / x x / x x / x x / x<br>
            Mouthing of engines, made rabid with power,<br>
            / x x / x x / x x / x<br>
            Into the holocaust snorting and plunging...&nbsp;</div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As I scanned, I became interested in my overly 
            politically correct reactions to Ridge’s glorifying all-male construction 
            crews, Brotherhood, etc., as well as out-and-out racism. The only exception 
            to common gender roles seems to be mentioning sex before marriage and 
            pink collar jobs. This in a poet praised as a leftist activist and early 
            gender heroine. As I read more, especially in <i>Sun-Up</i>, I was surprised 
            to read about a modern single mother working at home when her child 
            is small, then hiring a less-than-preferable nanny to go to work after 
            that. I was surprised because she describes the same wretched child 
            care / pink collar job situation thousands of (especially politically 
            conservative) women working in the technology industry are discovering 
            as though it were new.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There is a mammy poem in dialect about white women 
            throwing a black infant into a bonfire during an East St. Louis race 
            riot. A critic at the time called this the only poem in the volume also 
            containing the recitative “The Ghetto” in which “Miss Lola Ridge” becomes 
            “a full poet.” It’s truly bad. The very questionable irony is undermined 
            by the baby’s parents’ depiction as drunk or missing. These flaws sit 
            alongside complex characterizations and beautiful images I had chosen 
            to attend on early readings. Some of these poems I wanted to cut or 
            supply with female pronouns, without attention to any sort of archival 
            record. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After that, I began to worry about italic. Ridge 
            uses left-margin capitalization sometimes deliberately, left-margin 
            proper case sometimes deliberately, and sometimes the left margin seems 
            to reflect no poetic or editorial decision made by this poet-editor. 
            Similarly, she makes extensive use of three and four dot ellipses, but 
            does not consistently capitalize after four dot sentence-ending ellipses. 
            She uses a great deal of italic, for quotes and voices, but again, not 
            consistently. While I ignored the Project Gutenberg welcoming of editing 
            in favor of being as letter-perfect to the print edition I could be 
            as a single volunteer scanner / proofer with a jillion other tasks at 
            hand, there is a problem with .txt files. They are overly considerate 
            of below-par browsers. In other words, the .txt file, which allows no 
            italic, standard was set years ago, when most IT professionals felt 
            a hierarchy of browsers would be in use, and that everyone, at least, 
            would be able to read .txt files. This, five to ten years later, is 
            not the case: the problem is everyone has a browser, but the server 
            the Project Gutenberg files reside upon is too slow to serve them effectively 
            without either a great deal of patience and forbearance or a corporate-speed 
            TCP/IP connection. In other words, the poet’s intentions run awry the 
            “e-publisher’s” intentions because the “e-publisher” was overly solicitous 
            towards the audience, and has ignored poet’s intentions in many respects 
            in order to serve a case which is untrue about the audience. There are 
            not thousands of old 386 machines in Nepal being used to access English 
            public domain texts on the internet.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Since I began this project, more and more texts 
            are being made available: H.D.’s <i>Hymen</i> is now online. Additionally, 
            unpublished US materials written before 1922 will enter the public domain 
            in 2011, a loophole which, if not closed, would make this aspect of 
            US Copyright law more liberal than that in other countries. Copyright 
            was extended by a law sponsored by Sonny Bono before his death in order 
            to protect Mickey Mouse and other works of late modernism. It is time 
            to get a fuller picture of first wave modernist women’s writing, much 
            of which was used to replace earlier genteel writing, while its authors 
            were derided as “feminus scriblerus.”</p>

            Tupelo Press will publish her first book, <i>Locket</i>, in 2003; another 
            manuscript, <i>Heresy</i>, was a finalist in the 2002 National Poetry 
            Series competition. She is at work on two collections of criticism: 
            one on contemporary experimental poetry written by women and one on
