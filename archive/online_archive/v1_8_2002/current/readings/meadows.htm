        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Deborah Meadows</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">By studying the recent poetry of Rosmarie Waldrop 
          such as <i>Reluctant Gravities</i> and<i> Lawn</i> <i>of Excluded Middle</i>, 
          readers may engage with poetry in linguistically experimental forms that 
          investigates gender, propositional logic, and representation. Waldrop, 
          who comes to English as an immigrant from Germany, uses philosophical 
          sources and propositional forms to undo these same forms and to investigate, 
          in part, what it is to represent women in language.</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Attentively reading Waldrop can be a study of the 
          variable map of human constructions both of knowledge and gender: illustrative 
          of a more general movement away from Enlightenment era knowledge that 
          is expressed and contained in Linnean categories. This sort of encyclopedic 
          knowledge, the exhaustive catalog, for example, of mathematical axioms 
          found in Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead’s <i>Principia Mathematica</i> 
          or in Ludwig Wittgenstein’s <i>Tractatus</i> shifts in late modernity 
          to a systems-approach, or variable language game such as that found in 
          Wittgenstein’s <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> or in Chaos Theory 
          (wherein large structures may self-organize and spill over into other 
          structures unpredicted by a diced-to-the-smallest unit approach in the 
          study of physical phenomena).</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Woven Fabrics, Disrupted Centers</b></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I will begin with the very evocative and historically-loaded 
          image of a woman weaving in a poem in Rosmarie Waldrop’s<i> Lawn of Excluded</i> 
          <i>Middle.</i> Here she describes her adaptation of logic’s law of the 
          excluded middle wherein, first, statements are either true or false (the 
          assertion that no other status exists, or what physicists today term a 
          finding of indeterminate nature) and second, that opposites in truth value 
          cannot coexist (a view that rules out logical paradoxes, for example). 
          Waldrop writes that: “<i>Lawn of Excluded Middle</i> plays with the idea 
          of woman as the excluded middle. Women and, more particularly, the womb, 
          the empty center of the woman’s body, the locus of fertility” (81). She 
          continues with a reference to Wittgenstein’s work in language games, variable 
          play and positioning, stating that his “games are played on the<i> Lawn 
          of Excluded Middle</i>” (81) wherein the “law” of divine proscription 
          or human legislation is the domestic “lawn” that marks the transition 
          or fault-line between private home and public space.  This may take on 
          connotations of where children play, how status may be assessed, how private 
          property is characterized, and so forth.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But back to the woman weaving. Here is number 4 from 
          the first part of <i>Lawn of</i> <i>Excluded Middle</i>:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p style="text-align:justify">4.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Even if a woman sits at a loom, it does 
            not mean she must weave a cosmogony or clothes to cover the emptiness 
            underneath. It might just be a piece of cloth which, like any center 
            of attention, absorbs the available light the way a waterfall can form 
            a curtain of solid noise through which only time can pass. She has been 
            taught to imagine other things, but does not explain, disdaining defense 
            while her consciousness streams down the rapids. The light converges 
            on what might be the hollow of desire or the incomplete self, or just 
            lint in her pocket. Her hour will also come with the breaking of water. 
            (14)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This poem seems to propose an alternative to the 
          grand scheme of weaving as either world-making or as making a covering, 
          hence constitution, of gender. Because the “she” is actively imaging things 
          other than what “she has been taught,” there is a quiet rebellion underway 
          as the woven fabric is produced, as the formation of time is disconnected 
          from the rhythm of work, and as the clarity of boundaries between center 
          and margin is disrupted. The excluded middle — woman, her sexuality — 
          is deflated in a three-part movement: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="DOUBLESPACE">1. the uncertainty (“what might be the hollow of 
            her desire”) might also<i> not</i> be the hollow as structure or location.</p>
          <p class="DOUBLESPACE">2. the uncertainty of psychological definitions 
            of woman’s “incomplete self,” nicely deflating the Freudian definition 
            of woman as a man without a penis, or of being an emotionally incomplete 
            creature until fulfilled by a man (grounded on the mythic notion of 
            woman and man as a single severed creature seeking the other half in 
            hope of completion).</p>
          <p class="DOUBLESPACE">3. the presence of the mundane that brings us down 
            from confecting high theoretical positions to perhaps it’s “just lint 
            in her pocket,” a mass-produced pocket not a vagina. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This language game is so cluttered culturally that 
          it can propose all three and still be neither certain nor exhaustive. 
          Lack of those qualities (certainty and comprehensiveness) is central to 
          Waldrop’s poetry; lack or “gap gardening” lives within contexts that drive 
          and subvert meanings, both doing and undoing existence, and setting forth 
          the poetics of coexistence of opposites, of variations and subversions. 
          Waldrop refuses to stop the movement of the syntax and paragraph to settle 
          meaning or to set it with the certitude that can appoint meaning as a 
          singularity, a final description, or circumscribed conclusion.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Readers and Communities</b>&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Juliana Spahr conceives of other, disruptive ways 
          of reading in<i> Everybody’s Autonomy: Connective Reading and Collective 
          Identity</i> to counteract, in part, the normative process that reader-centered 
          theory had become, and, in part, to place poetry that involves linguistic 
          experimentation in full demotic reception. Spahr, for example, re-examines 
          Stanley Fish’s claim that we readers become part of “interpretative communities” 
          by pointing out how membership in that community requires reading like 
          Stanley Fish or whomever the professor at hand may be. My application 
          of this idea to Waldrop involves how Spahr argues for ways that literary 
          works connect us to larger communities. She writes:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>I argue here that when we tackle literary criticism’s central question 
            of what sort of selves literary works create, we should value works 
            that encourage connection. By “connection” here I mean works that present 
            and engage with large, public worlds that are in turn shared with readers 
            . . . (4)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>and further:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>. . . I would include identificatory moments in this, but I would also 
            want to include moments that are non-identificatory: moments when one 
            realizes the limits of one’s knowledge; moments of partial or qualified 
            identification; moments when one respects unlikeness . . . I am interested 
            in works that look at the relation between reading and identity in order 
            to comment on the nature of collectivity . . . (5)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Much of Waldrop’s recent poetry shows her social 
          and historic context, her involvement with philosophical reconsiderations 
          in epistemology such as the critiques of neutral objectivity, of essentialism 
          in gender studies, and with the Marxian distinction between use and commodity 
          values. Her process of inscription on top of Wittgenstein’s texts shows 
          her diverting the clarity and authority from propositional logic and exposing 
          its limits of representation. Because Waldrop demonstrates an agile, critical 
          thought of the varying constructions of knowledge, reading her can connect 
          us with a larger community by also considering gender in the construction 
          of knowledge. Readers may see that it’s not enough to have access to various 
          fields, but that those fields are no longer stable and certain in their 
          knowledge claims. Most writers in gender studies have by now virtuously 
          denounced essentialism (the notion that women have certain traits, are 
          better or more moral because of them, etc.); some have turned to “standpoint” 
          feminism, this being the idea that outsiders (such as women) may offer 
          something different as a goal or strategy to the knowledge project at 
          hand. These are questions Waldrop takes up in her poetry: why the “margin” 
          should want to make the “center” more powerful, why the knowledge project 
          at hand is the one non-assimilated “others” should work toward; do the 
          “margin” and “center” even exist? To me, these are important points given 
          that most of us out here in the larger Spahrian community must consider 
          somewhere along the line how we “others” may have different agendas and 
          frameworks from one another and how then, we are able to approach democratically 
          the knowledge projects of our respective fields. &nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Interpretive Bodies and Falling Communities</b></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In <i>Reluctant Gravities</i>, “he” and “she” are 
          in “Conversations” throughout the volume interspersed with brief sections, 
          “Song” and “Meditation.” As a marriage of two people slips into the marriage 
          of meaning and sign, we can see that there will be differences, gaps, 
          contraries that will not reconcile. Several fascinating conversations 
          ensue as well as philosophical investigations. Gravity becomes plural, 
          from the title onward, and includes variable meanings, never settling 
          on one. Some of those variations include: a fall from grace (Edenic apple), 
          forbidden love such as a mistress, how the reliability of sign, of language, 
          breaks down and betrays; physical phenomena (Newton’s apple) that become 
          the basis of “laws” of nature, laws that Waldrop writes in her “Notes” 
          at the back of <i>Reluctant Gravities</i> can only work on certain days 
          and on certain types of problems — quantum mechanics is useful on the 
          alternating days.</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Central to <i>Reluctant Gravities</i> is Waldrop’s 
          insight that interpretation can cancel the body, and her poetry is determined 
          to re-insert or maintain the corporeal within philosophical systems as 
          a position of gender strength. In “On Ways of the Body” we read, “The 
          price of deciphering seems to be transparency” (57), but she argues for 
          the “missing meat, bone, metabolism and ratios of heat and hunger. At 
          the price of windows muddied with fingerprints” (57). Another example 
          in “Blindman’s Buff” — a revision of bluff, or boastful lie, changed to 
          nudity: “Did I learn to read in order to purge incomprehensible desires?”(59). 
          This is a fine line to place alongside Spahr’s inquiry into imperial conformity 
          of standardized reading. The passage also does the work of questioning 
          how “she” does not have her felt desires represented well, often, or variously 
          in the canon of reading material. By implication (and social critique) 
          “she” reads representations of his desires everywhere.</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Signaling a reversal of the woman-as-lack, or woman 
          as excluded middle, is Waldrop’s working through what philosophical investigations 
          lack: that is, a body. Here in “Meditation on the Indefinite,” she writes 
          on the blind spots of philosophy:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Sharper concepts would not pack lunch. Sharper eyes not see farther 
            than irregularities of wave and too wet. Not their own blind spots. 
            Born as an afterthought I doubt propositions without body heat or shadow. 
            (68)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Conceptual structures, she seems to argue here, are 
          grounded in physicality, sexuality, corporeality: all these gravities 
          are missing from prior work that should reveal its human fingerprints, 
          assumptions, cultural outlooks in its knowledge constructions.</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Formulas in Relation to Originals</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">An obscuring of the body and felt experience as well 
          as the difficulties in representing those in language can be an occupational 
          hazard for philosophers or other knowledge workers; we read how “words 
          and things played their shellgame” (78) on the relation of signs and meanings, 
          a difficult marriage. In another book-length poem, <i>Split Infinites</i>, 
          Waldrop writes, “She had looked in too many mirrors to experience experience 
          as experience” (28). This play of reflective surfaces not only serves 
          as a cautionary poetic for those investigating axiomatic descriptions 
          of the world but it opens the possibility of another description of the 
          world entirely. </span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rosalind E. Krauss in <i>The Originality of the</i> 
          <i>Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths</i> considers how surfaces speak 
          to other surfaces and connotations might drive denotations. Her title 
          essay covers several ideas, and I will avoid over-simplifying them by 
          remarking that I am looking only at portions of her work. She theorizes 
          the modernist “myth” as the elevation of the “original” and the repression 
          of the reproduction, or recognizable formula, by examining the ethos and 
          effects of post-mortem recastings of Rodin’s sculpture, Jane Austen’s 
          character Catherine in <i>Northanger Abbey</i> who learns how to “see” 
          the outdoors as a “picturesque” landscape painting such as that practiced 
          by Reverend William Gilpin, and Sherrie Levine’s photographs of Edward 
          Weston’s photographs. Several ideas emerge including how we learn to “see” 
          formulas of things, not originals, although the two become, and have been, 
          dependent on each other. Here is Krauss:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Thus what Austen’s, Gilpin’s, and the Dictionary’s picturesque reveals 
            to us is that although the <i>singular</i> and the <i>formulaic</i> 
            or repetitive may be semantically opposed, they are nonetheless conditions 
            for each other: the two logical halves of the concept <i>landscape</i>. 
            The priorness and repetition of pictures is necessary to the singularity 
            of the picturesque, because for the beholder singularity depends on 
            being recognized as such, a re-cognition made possible only by a prior 
            example . . . (166)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">and further on the social relations of singularity:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Now this economy of the paired opposition — singular and multiple — 
            can easily be examined within the aesthetic episode that is termed <i>the 
            Picturesque</i>, an episode that was crucial to the rise of a new class 
            of audience for art, one that was focused on the practice of taste as 
            an exercise in the recognition of singularity, or — in its application 
            within the language of romanticism — originality . . . (166)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Throughout Waldrop’s poetry, questions on how understandings 
          of what constitutes versions of reality slip through imperfect language 
          systems. Highly aware of how language causes us to “see the picturesque,” 
          Waldrop’s poetic investigations seem to aim for perceptions between the 
          “boundary and blur.” Krauss discusses how postmodern visual artists overtly 
          use repetition and reproduction to comment on the ideological saturation 
          of images. In her essay “Alarms &amp; Excursions,” Waldrop collages many 
          differing ideas and sources on poetry and the political. A field of variable 
          positions results. In one “Alarm,” Waldrop cautions readers not to trust 
          merely in experimental forms; they, too, can be hijacked by the state:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>The two decades before Hitler came to power were a period of incredible 
            literary flowering, upheaval, exploration in Germany. All the dadaists 
            and expressionists had been questioning, challenging, exploring, changing 
            the language, limbering up its joints. So the German language should 
            have been in very good condition, yet the Nazis had no trouble putting 
            it to work for their purposes, perverting it to where what was said 
            was light years from what was meant. So, while language thinks for us, 
            there is no guarantee that it will be in the direction we like. (47)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Drawing on Wittgenstein’s <i>Tractatus</i>’ “picture 
          theory of language”(based on his originating insight that a courtroom 
          model of car accident served as a proposition, a description of a possible 
          state of affairs, and so, by reverse, a proposition is a model or picture 
          of life, (Perloff 248)), Waldrop’s <i>The Reproduction of Profiles</i> 
          weighs in:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>I had inferred from pictures that the world was real and therefore 
            paused, for who knows what will happen if we talk truth while climbing 
            the stairs. In fact, I was afraid of following the picture to where 
            it reaches right out into reality, laid against it like a ruler. I thought 
            I would die if my name didn’t touch me, or only with its very end, leaving 
            the inside open to so many feelers like chance rain pouring down from 
            the clouds. You laughed and told everybody that I had mistaken the Tower 
            of Babel for Noah in his Drunkenness. (5)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In multiple play reproductions are not originals, 
          but as Krauss points out are dependent on them, may even be subordinated 
          to them. Reproductions are repetitions, stamping, printing (Rosmarie and 
          husband Keith have run Burning Deck press for forty years). In combinatory 
          play with <i>profiles</i>, the reading is rich and opens possibilities

          a dossier, that is an extensive gathering of information usually conducted 
          by the state, and a sketchy outline such as a charcoal or silhouette, 
          or even a skyline that takes on an emblematic charge. Read alongside <i>Lawn 
          of Excluded Middle</i>, we have themes of figure / ground dichotomy that 
          Waldrop muddies, of rejection of the process of definition via negation, 
          of felt and allegorized desire, of the call of gravity as desire and life-force 
          connecting us to earth and each other; we have:</span></p>

          <p>15</span></p>
          <p>The word “not” seems like a poor expedient to designate all that escapes 
            my understanding like the extra space between us when I press my body 
            against yours, perhaps the distance of desire, which we carry like a 
            skyline and which never allows us to be where we are, as if past and 
            future had their place whereas the present dips and disappears under 
            your feet, so suddenly your stomach is squeezed up into your throat 
            as the plane crashes. This is why some try to stretch their shadow across 
            the gap as future fame while the rest of us take up residence in the 
            falling away of land, even though our nature is closer to water. (25)&nbsp;</span></p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Ambiguity of Apples</b></span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Readers may ask how Waldrop constructs a subjectivity 
          by refusing a resolution into fixed meaning; we may ask what slips out? 
          what flickers between meaning and unreadability? How does she assert meaning 
          or truth functions that diverge from propositional logic? Ah, the apples. 
          In <i>Reluctant Gravities</i>, not surprisingly, there are many kinds 
          of apples. Sexual desire is located in “the body, jubilant to meet its 
          double, bites into the apple” (85), but the category of subjectivity is 
          unstable and problematic:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Or, she says, standing here at the foot of the stairs as if they were 
            an exit, maybe <i>I’m</i> what’s vanishing, to the point of a figment 
            in someone else’s story, feverish. Then my arrogant first person singular 
            would limp in a dichotomy of virtual and existence . . . (85)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">More apples of the earth: “Everything in our universe 
          curves back to the apple.” (<i>Lawn </i>39); Edenic apples: “A bite from 
          the apple wrapped in snake.” (<i>Split </i>28); “You thought it was improbable 
          that the concept of original sin was upset by electricity in motion any 
          more than by gravity’s competing for the apple.” (<i>Lawn</i> 63) and 
          “We can’t hope to prove gravity from the fact that it tallies with the 
          fall of an apple when the nature of tallying is what Eve’s bite called 
          into question.” (<i>Lawn</i> 73). Multiple readings are possible with 
          Waldrop’s poetry, and this prior quotation seems to suggest that sexual 
          knowing can offer an alternative to the naming function of Eden, to its 
          categorical way of knowing, and asserts a way to know as a god. By contrast, 
          Edenic knowledge projects that seek to divide between true and false, 
          to create binary oppositions, and to “tally” is to know as a mere human: 
          “I knew that true or false is irrelevant in the pursuit of knowledge . 
          . .” (73). Again, we see a reading of the figure / ground tension, a co-existence, 
          or collapsing together, of language and communication, of lover and desire 
          for lover, (“It is like the kind of language that vanishes into communication, 
          as you might into my desire for you.” (73)), shadow and light within an 
          “indifferent” universe.</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There are apples of ambiguity. I will quote a related 
          passage from <i>Reluctant Gravities</i> at length because it also involves 
          Wittgenstein’s duck-rabbit puzzle treated in his <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. 
          Based on the possibility of dual reading of a psychological drawing, she 
          writes: “And I must distinguish between the ‘continuous seeing’ of an 
          aspect and the ‘dawning’ of an aspect” (194). By contrast, Waldrop’s “he” 
          seeks the maintenance of ambiguity and her “she” refers to William Empson’s 
          <i>Seven Types of Ambiguity</i>, positing the need, possibly, for change 
          of perceptual habit and a demagnification of visual evaluation to see 
          anew:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p style="text-align:justify">On Change&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">A splinter lodged in the brain, he says, 
            this effort to trap fluctuations in wavelength or feeling. To see not 
            only both duck and rabbit in the puzzle, but to freeze the moment of 
            flip. Or a moment of aging. Is it too subtle, like grass growing, like 
            the size of a proton? Or is our inability more categorical, the way 
            a shadow cannot catch the light, or the eye see its blind spot? Do I 
            love your face because it is yours or because of the way it differs 
            from circle, parabola, ellipse?</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Perhaps we need change to see what’s there, 
            she says. And ambiguity, to be aware of seeing. Seven types of apples. 
            But focus on the curvature of the lens, and night gains all color, torpor 
            all deeds, even their reflections in the river. Pores stop their doors. 
            The grass is blunt with mass, the sky not infinite, just soot. (63)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">By working through the theme of change, or aging, 
          we can return to her earlier<i> Lawn of</i> <i>Excluded Middle</i> wherein 
          ambiguity is also the underlying condition for love, that “apples that 
          would not succumb to the attraction of the ground”(49) only verge on meaning 
          or completion. Here Waldrop plays against meanings of gravity, succumbing 
          to desire, but, less obviously, the figure / ground relationship of self 
          and other, and the experience of flickering between the two, the “flip.”</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Attraction to the ground can also, will also, involve 
          solitude and separation from the lover. Waldrop asks, “Would separation 
          act as an astringent? Ink our characters more sharply?” but ends by dividing 
          the sense of time and direction of the two lovers: “You may be able to 
          travel fast forward without looking back, but I paint my lashes to slow 
          the child in my face and climb the winding stairs back to a logic whose 
          gaps are filled by mermaids” (<i>Lawn </i>52). Would there be a heightened 
          contrast of typeface and page, of figure and ground, but he hurtles toward 
          the future; whereas, she seeks to remain in youth filled with imaginary 
          creatures, life of imagination — yet mermaids are also sexual creatures 
          created by deprived sailors.</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One may explore eclectically, and some positioning 
          may require rejections of older positions or subjectivities: </span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Finally I came to prefer the risk of falling to the arrogance of solid 
            ground and placed myself on the thin line of translation, balancing 
            precariously between body harnessed to slowness and categories of electric 
            charge whizzing across fields nobody could stand on . . . (<i>Lawn</i> 
            79)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">She complicates the beautiful inclusion of translation 
          as a bodily experience by exploring whether translation would connect 
          to universal rules of arithmetic or to her individual biography. Further, 
          she wonders at structure — would they, as a couple, be mirror images and 
          reversible or halves folded or androgynous in nature uniting male and 
          female “sharing out the sensitive zones among the contenders?” and ends 
          with a tarnished hope in the vitality of “everyday language . . . to keep 
          the apple in the habit of falling though the curve of the world no longer 
          fits out flat feet and matter’s become too porous to place them on.” (79). 
          Once again, representation comes short of the world’s worldliness. So 
          what can this mean, that the world-description and our understandings 
          through physics make the world “too porous” to hold us, and curve and 
          flatness differ in perception of shape and existence? Can we carry on, 
          live and love, self-aware of contending versions and descriptions of tension 
          and attraction, between man and woman, figure and ground, word and meaning? 
          &nbsp;</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>No Centers: Individual or National Trauma</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What can it mean to seek a place beyond dichotomy? 
          Is this another Edenic urging, to go beyond margin and center? Here Waldrop 
          points out the trouble with gravity: it always re-establishes and points 
          to the center of the earth. A constant reminder of the “center” contributes 
          to her <i>reluctance</i>. Here is what “she” seeks: “A space between boundary 
          and blur, she says, a nakedness beyond male and female, edge of the sea. 
          ...The way radiation bathes the entire universe in a feeble glow and thought 
          chases after the receding galaxies at such speed there is no question 
          of a center and the squeeze of gravity becomes mere alibi. ...” (<i>Reluctant</i> 
          32). Yet part of this paradise of beyondness not only re-frames how knowledge 
          can be constructed, not only provides a way out of gender subordination, 
          but, according to “he,” it also might exclude the individuating portions 
          of subjectivity including the painful moments of the past: “But no ducts 
          to the marrow of the mind, he says, most private part, opaque like a trauma, 
          no fixed address. No field glasses on the firings, the real event, the 
          swerve of light. ...” (<i>Reluctant</i> 32). Following a Spahrian reading, 
          I associated the field glasses with a war context, but in an email from 
          Rosmarie Waldrop, I learned that she was “thinking of the <u>firing of 
          neurons in the brain</u> and how little we know about the functioning 
          of the mind, esp. the brain-mind connection.” She prefaced this set of 
          comments with: “I’ll say what I consciously had in mind. Which does not 
          exclude other interpretations.”</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Born in 1935, Waldrop was only ten years old when 
          World War Two ended. She writes in her section in the <i>Contemporary 
          Authors Autobiography Series</i> that “I was taught. The Nazi salute, 
          the flute. ...” during the war years. In her email she writes that “finding 
          out about it all as a teenager that [she] had to contend with” the terror 
          of the war in an active way. She writes that during the war, she was too 
          young to actively engage in these realities.</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In a 1999 interview conducted by Joan Retallack, 
          “A Conversation with Rosmarie Waldrop,” Retallack phrases it:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>. . . Under Allied occupation, [Rosmarie] met an extraordinarily witty, 
            widely read American soldier, Keith Waldrop, who became her dearest 
            friend, literary collaborator, and, a month after her move to the United 
            States in 1958, her husband. (333)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Together, Keith and Rosmarie formed Burning Deck 
          Press, dedicated to publishing poetry, and Rosmarie has published widely 
          acclaimed translations of important Jewish poets, Edmond Jabès and Paul 
          Celan, among others. These are the socio-historical conditions in the 
          context of, and through, which Waldrop writes her poetry. It’s no surprise 
          that she has expressed her finest ideas through experimental forms — how 
          could a romantic lyric address the gravity of these events and human atrocities? 
          In a statement Waldrop had published in <i>Boundary 2</i>, she asks:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Who speaks when the poem says “I”? I hold with Keats: “the chameleon 
            poet ... has no self. None. Or a multitude....” </span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And she continues: </span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>We can’t escape our situation: nation-state, international capital, 
            the language we write in, all that.</span></p>
          <p>But for my work I’m free to choose my own working context which cuts 
            across nation, language, times. Blake as much as Queneau and Dickinson; 
            my contemporaries as much as Musil, Kafka, Mallarmé. (267)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In a troubling Conversation, “On Vertigo” in <i>Reluctant 
          Gravities</i>, “he” alternates war imagery with marriage, and “she” conflates 
          an image of a rooster with “self-gravity” or self-sufficiency. I learned 
          in the same email that Waldrop thinks of the “he” of the poem as “a construction 
          of male (often the stereotype) in my culture.” Further, she writes in 
          her email that “given the cosmic dimensions [of the part by “he”], which 
          I hope is a marker of the irony making the “he” utterly stereotypical 
          male thinking (marriage as detumescence!). So yes, war as between the 
          sexes is there, male dominance, colonial thinking, etc.” His part reads: </span> 
        </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>That’s why thought, he says, means fear. Sicklied o’er with the pale 
            cast. And the feel of a woman. No boundary or edge. No foothold. Blast 
            outspins gravity, breath to temples, gut to throat, propositions break 
            into gasps. Then marriage. The projectile returns to the point of firing. 
            Shaken, I try to take shelter in ratios of dots on a screen. (13)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Her part spoofs William Carlos Williams’ so-much-depends-on 
          poem with: “A narrow bed, she says. Easier to internalize combustion under 
          a hood while rain falls in sheets, glazing a red wheelbarrow for the hell 
          of it” (13). While this fun-sounding impulsiveness nicely excludes narrow 
          utility, the poem shifts to an ominous image of sexual aggression or rape. 
          However, in her email, Waldrop writes that the rooster was “An early childhood 
          experience, very likely the first sex act I saw — one precisely before 
          such categories as rape or consent.”</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>. . . But I once watched a rooster mate, and he felt hard inside me, 
            a clenched fist, an alien rock inside me, because there was no thinking 
            to dissolve him. So to slide down, so unutterably, so indifferent. (13)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Interestingly, this is followed by “he” contemplating 
          imperial domination: “I don’t understand, he says, how manifest destiny 
          blows west with the grass, how the word ‘soul’ floats through the language 
          the way pollen pervades tissue”(14). And two lines later, this question 
          on the imperious nature or propensities of language itself: “Is language 
          our cockadoodledoo?”(14). This, for me, raises questions on the fabricated 
          nature of our notions of cultural authenticity that are dependent on the 
          subordination and alterity of, in this case, Native Americans and African-Americans: 
          “Do I need arrowheads or dreadlocks to reach my rawest thoughts?” (14). 
          Waldrop writes in the same email that arrowheads and dreadlocks also have 
          a component of nostalgia for the supposedly more “natural,” more “immediate,” 
          more “animal” life in “primitive cultures — immediately ironized by the 
          juxtaposition with the computer keyboard.” This section is followed by 
          what seems the continued recounting “she” makes of the rooster:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>The longer I watched, she says, the more distinctly did I feel the 
            snap of that shot flat inside me. So simple the economy of nature: space 
            appears along with matter. So to slide down and stand there. Such self-gravity. 
            So narrow the gap between mistake and morning sickness. (14)</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">An interesting contrast or variation on this is Waldrop’s 
          opening image in<i> Lawn</i> wherein she posits “women have a soul” and 
          that her poetry includes “the empty space I place at the center of each 
          poem to allow penetration.” The implicit commentary on agency, that “I 
          place” folds into the absence — there is no developmental scheme here, 
          but shifting and folding surfaces that refuse escape routes, stairways 
          to heaven, transcendent romantic experiences. The sexual and / or epistemic 
          penetration of her poems propose Waldrop as a poet, yet for a woman to 
          be a poet may mean taking on the status of an outlaw or weird creature 
          to be subordinated out of existence. Or, as Waldrop would probably add, 
          it may mean nothing. &nbsp;</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Language Games, Formulas, and Aphorisms</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Further into the text, she asks “What’s left over 
          if I subtract the fact that my leg goes up from the fact that I raise 
          it?” and continues on the importance of will which can dwarf the significance 
          of action: “For doing itself seems not to have any volume: an extensionless 
          point, the point of a needle out to draw blood regardless” (30). So action 
          can also be lethal. This extends and politicizes Wittgenstein’s §616 wherein 
          he writes: “When I raise my arm, I have not wished it might go up. The 
          voluntary action excludes the wish....” (160). </span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In <i>Wittgenstein’s Ladder: Poetic Language and 
          the Strangeness of the Ordinary</i>, Marjorie Perloff points out that 
          language games in the sense meant by Wittgenstein refer, in part, to the 
          cultural clutter and assumptions operant to the grammar and vocabulary 
          of certain fields (58), and that he argued against the presence of gaps 
          in grammar, that grammar is somehow, and this is my phrase here: self-evident. 
          Perloff cites <i>Wittgenstein's Lectures: Cambridge, 1930-32</i>: “there 
          are no gaps in grammar; grammar is always complete” (16). Self-evidence 
          is the sort of audacious claim, in my view, that Waldrop is unwrapping 
          and deflating with her poetry. Here is an examination of the formulaic 
          that guides our “seeing” of the singular — a visual / cultural game. </span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perloff continues with a description of Wittgenstein’s 
          work and his “attitude toward any totalizing scheme must give way to &#8216;travel 
          over a wide field of thought criss-cross in every direction.&#8217; Only 
          such “criss-cross” movements advance our thinking; hence, a Wittgenstein 
          text is “alternately anecdotal and aphoristic, repetitive and disjunctive, 
          didactic and jokey, self-assertive and self-canceling. . . ” (66). Many 
          have remarked on Wittgenstein’s and Waldrop’s use of the aphoristic form 
          of writing. What are aphorisms and what can they do? </span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While part of their conventions requires aphorisms 
          to preserve, conserve, and distill largish masses of language to intensified 
          units, Waldrop, as we’ve seen, works to disperse and date language, to 
          place it (or acknowledge the saturated and long history of language) within 
          sociopolitical contexts. This differs from the conventional practice of 
          aphorisms as collectible parcels that can be plucked out of time. As Waldrop’s 
          poetry suggests, aphorisms hold a datable past given certain information 
          conditions are met. </span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Part of how oral memory works is to have units that 
          are duplicable and easily reproduced, but Waldrop cleverly takes the unconcluded 
          route of the series: repetition, formulaic singularities, narratives of 
          arithmentic’s simple origins that rise in complexity. By the obverse, 
          how is a series, repetition, etc. halted? In part, serial progression 
          is halted when knowledge is concluded or is presented within the familiar 
          rhetorical structure known as “conclusion” or “indeterminate finding,” 
          or when presented as<i> the truth function of experience rather than of 
          language</i>. Here is where Waldrop does her “gap gardening.” At the syntax 
          level, the sentence is an axiomatic structure that both: 1. annihilates 
          what it uses as a vehicle of expression, of evidence; and 2. restores 
          and preserves its vehicle as an inseparable structure of meaning, of evidence. 
          Waldrop shows us the gap between language as a self-referential system 
          and experience.</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like embroidered mottos that set a moral tone in 
          domestic settings, conventional aphorisms may condense or imply large 
          structures of thought, but at the same time they do not express anything 
          larger than themselves such as an extended exposition or lengthy argument. 
          We won’t find Waldrop embroidering here; her critique can be read as socio 
          cultural. Her poetry suggests that conventional aphorisms, like narrative, 
          make events more intelligible than they are; they propose a rationality, 
          a penetrating insight or analysis, they can codify doubt or skepticism, 
          and, like Wittgenstein’s concept of grammar, they can express self-referential 
          logic. Aphorisms can codify truth by the surety of its manner: turn a 
          truth into a truism. Not so Waldrop. From the <i>Reproduction of Profiles</i>:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>In order to understand the nature of language you began to paint, thinking 
            that the logic of reference would become evident once you could settle 
            the quarrels of point, line, and color. I was distracted from sliding 
            words along the scales of significance by smoke on my margin of breath. 
            I waited for the flame, the passage from eye to world. At dawn, you 
            crawled into bed, exhausted, warning me against drawing inferences across 
            blind canvas. I ventured that a line might represent a tower that would 
            reach the sky, or, on the other hand, rain falling. You replied that 
            the world was already taking up too much space. (33)</span></p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I will stop, rather than end, by posing some questions 
          for further investigation. How can we extend the possibilities offered 
          by Spahr’s theory of reading experimental poetry? Can feminist philosophers 
          examine a literary approach to philosophical questions by using Waldrop’s 
          poetry? Can philosophers read from and through their experience as women 
          (or men) in sociopolitical explorations of language and knowledge projects 
          in Waldrop? </span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Can philosophers use their intellectual training 
          to appreciate Waldrop as she disrupts well-traveled paths and re-joins 
          body and mind, long-separated in Western philosophical thought? </span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Particularly problematic for women, given our historic 
          association with “nature” as antagonistic to mind: can I read Waldrop 
          through my biography as a woman in a love relationship without reverting 
          to romantic tropes or to a facile division between head and heart? Can 
          I use my background in philosophy likewise to re-join body and mind?</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Can we read Waldrop through a shared critique and 
          practice that pushes the limits of logical propositions, that explores 
          the limits of knowledge, that seeks to speak from a small but democratic 
          “we” rather than an imperial or over-psychologized “I”?</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I think implicit in this paper has been a mere beginning 
          of the above explorations. I will end with this statement by Waldrop from 
          her essay, “Thinking of Follows”:</span></p>
        <p>Palimpsest:</span></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>But it is not true that “nothing is given”: Language comes not only 
            with an infinite potential for new combinations, but with a long history 
            contained in it.</span></p>
          <p>The blank page is not blank. No text has one single author. Whether 
            we are conscious of it or not, we always write on top of a palimpsest 
            (cf. Duncan’s “grand collage”).</span></p>
          <p>This is not a question of linear “influence,” but of writing as dialog 
            with a whole net of previous and concurrent texts, tradition, with the 
            culture and language we breathe and move in, which conditions us even 
            while we help to construct it.</span></p>
          <p>Many of us have foregrounded this awareness as technique: using, collaging, 
            transforming, “translating” parts of other works. (Sloan 610)</span></p>
