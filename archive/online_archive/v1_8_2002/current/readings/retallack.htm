          Waldrop</P>
  <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
  
        <div class=Section1>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">[This is the second half of a conversation, begun 
            in 1991 with later revisions, mostly about Rosmarie Waldrop’s two novels, 
            <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> and <i>A Form/ of Taking/ It All</i>. 
            The first half of the conversation was published in <i>Contemporary 
            Literature </i>40.3 (Fall 1999).] </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: It’s not a given that a writer, having done 
            a particular kind of book, would — like you — then try to do something 
            completely different. Of course, the writer whose next book is similar 
            to previous ones might say the level or critical degree of difference 
            is in some other aspect of the work, that it's a more subtle difference.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That is true. There are writers who explore 
            in depth, rather than in “width.” They go over the same territory again 
            and again, digging deeper and deeper. Jabés does that. And Beckett. 
            But apparently I’m more interested in surfaces, in going sideways, rather 
            than deep.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: The way I would say it is that you are more 
            interested in form. But then what does that mean? I read an essay several 
            years ago in the journal <i>Genre</i> by a Chinese American scholar 
            who said that, in contrast to the West, Chinese culture is entirely 
            preoccupied with form, that the Chinese are “born into” a sensitivity 
            to form. But again what does that mean? Something spatial, perhaps, 
            more than temporal. For a book of poetry or prose, it might be as simple 
            as the graphics of the page — ratios and relations of white space to 
            print, placement of words. Just leafing through your two novels one 
            can already see that things are arranged differently from the norm of 
            the novel. The space is occupied, or unoccupied, in different ways. 
            One sees that kind of thing in <i>Tristram Shandy </i>— there are symbols 
            inserted, a page is covered in black, an entire chapter consists of 
            one short sentence... Or in Gertrude Stein’s poetic novel <i>Blood on 
            the Dining-Room Floor. </i>So, if you think of form in one of its aspects 
            as a framework defining boundaries, like any frame its presence draws 
            attention, helps you focus on what it sets off in a particular way.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Right, or better, form as intersection, rather 
            than something that contains. That’s the model I prefer. There are different 
            ways in which the materials intersect each other, and intersect the 
            page. It’s Pound’s idea of form as “a center around which, not a box 
            within which.” Which is also Merleau-Ponty’s definition of both form 
            and space: “not the <i>space in which</i>, but the <i>means through 
            which.</i>”</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: So, for instance where you are using captions 
            for sections — ?</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: It signals “jump.” Except that — I see here 
            “Elegy Continued.” So, the captions also establish continuity across 
            other sections. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: A way to keep in motion the play between different 
            levels of disjunction and continuity.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Right. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Which the whole book plays with in a variety 
            of ways. One of the things I loved was the recurrent, very precise anatomical 
            description of gestures — a muscular precision that makes them both 
            very specific and entirely generalizable, simultaneously meaningful 
            and oddly empty. And that pertains to the kind of formal sense I was 
            referring to before. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: On one level this undercuts narrative one-dimensionality 
            in Musil-style. I give a whole web of anatomical information instead 
            of saying “he lifted the cup to his mouth.” But gesture also interested 
            me as a form of communication that would seem to carry across boundaries 
            of language and culture. Though even the gestures are coded. The Spaniards 
            and Indians probably made as many mistakes interpreting gestures as 
            interpreting words. I wanted to take it back to the level of the body, 
            of muscle and tissue. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: If you think about historical narrative, not 
            many gestures get recorded. It’s the particle that doesn’t wave, a micro-level 
            in history. At some point in reading this I started to think of all 
            the billions of people on the planet making gestures over time and thereby 
            determining the course of history.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: And half of them women. There is, in <i>A Form/ 
            of Taking/ It All</i>, a whole strand from Frank Wedekind’s novella, 
            <i>Mine-Haha</i> <i>or the Physical Education of Girls. </i>He posits 
            a society in which the girls are brought up purely as bodies. They learn 
            to dance and to play music, nothing else. Then they’re sacrificed to 
            some God. This story has haunted me. Never mind that Wedekind distances 
            it by placing it in Aztec society. This separation of mind and body 
            — and defining them as male and female! When the <i>connection</i> between 
            mind and body is so much more interesting than the famous gap — which, 
            I’m happy to read, seems to be closing in favor of the body. Psychologists 
            like Damasio seem to ground all thought in “somatic markers,” “body-representing 
            neural structures.” So that there is no such thing as “pure thought” 
            — which is what my German schooling seemed oriented toward. I love getting 
            the body into my writing, especially to subvert ideas like “pure thought.” 
            At the same time I’m of course allergic against the stereotype, of the 
            woman as sheer body. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: The body usually enters in a rather fragmentary 
            way. Either concentrating on a part of the body or a particular motion 
            of the body. Or in the sorts of things that you do with mid-sentence 
            shifts from the intellectual to the sensual. Whole bodies rarely make 
            an appearance. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Is that true? </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Those odd, isolated gestures detached as they 
            are from any pretense of the kinds of deterministic fictions driven 
            by full-blown characters seem to punctuate in a very piquant way all 
            that is not pretensein this book. The relief from seamless narration, 
            for instance. From authorial omniscience. In their place in <i>A Form/ 
            of Taking/ It All</i> is this wonderful choreography of the immense 
            energy of intellect and imagination that needn’t deny the gaps since 
            it’s capable of transmitting across them. There’s something very strong 
            and moving about all those people waving from fragmentary accounts across 
            centuries and cultures. Sort of like the image of the arm sticking out 
            of the water with everything else submerged.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s a great image! So much is always submerged. 
            All we get are little glimpses. Of S.O.S. signals! Yes, the arm out 
            of the water is just right.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: All of which would be lost — that sense of 
            energized particles, particulars of history that could send waves in 
            many directions were you to engulf everything in a tidal wave of your 
            own narrative intentionality. Interestingly, I’m finding now as we talk 
            about this that I have a heightened sense of the play of the particle 
            in your structure [even before the last section where Columbus sails 
            toward “Unpredicted Particles” and continents] — the sense of the play 
            of particulars, the little coincidences that occur in the mind of the 
            person thinking about history. Author as participant observer whose 
            presence is continually swerving the energy from unpredicted particle 
            meeting particle in the constantly interrupted narrative consciousness 
            to produce the momentarily coherent wave. On page 80, section 2, you 
            write:</p>

          <p>These were all very slight experiences, of course, but they happened 
            over and over again. And later they meant the opposite of what they

        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, the indeterminacy of all the particulars 
          in relation. One reason why I wanted the initial section to be “A Form 
          of Vertigo,” feverishness, was that it is a state where the particulars 
          lose their boundaries. Also the vertigo of the mind when you make very 
          rapid connections. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Ah, the flaming wave? A hot/cold tension between 
          wave and particle? I think it’s important to identify the form of the 
          poetics here, the precise motions of language and thought and image that 
          attract and repel, intersect and travel parallel to one another. When 
          you’re doing something that you are labeling generically — “novel” — while 
          diverging from certain practices that have come to be seen as defining 
          that very genre — character and plot development for instance. What might 
          be experienced by the reader new to innovative forms is a sense of loss 
          — the absence of the familiar orientations. And even outrage that “the 
          whole story” is being withheld. And yet, delightfully, this is called 
          <i>A Form/ of Taking/ It <u>All</u></i>![emphasis added] At least one 
          of the operative words in this title must be “it.” This is clearly a different 
          “it” from what usually is taken to be the domain of the novel — the fully 
          fleshed-out content of a story, told with the beat by beat pulse of “real 
          life,” bracketed by the decorum of a beginning and an end.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: No, definitely this “it” is something else! Creeley’s 
          poem has intrigued me for many years, partly because you have a semantic 
          change each time you go to another line. First: “mind is a form,” then 
          “mind is a form of taking,” and then “mind is a form of taking it all”! 
          A wonderful progression. But I think the “it all” is really “it All”! 
          All of experience, all of tradition, all that there is, <i>Alles was der 
          Fall ist.</i> Keats’s mind as “a thoroughfare for <i>all </i>thoughts.” 
          And of course it’s impossible to <i>take</i> it all. But a form that would 
          <i>attempt</i> taking it all, or in Beckett’s words, which you often quote, 
          attempt “accommodating the mess.” This grandiose ambition!</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: In talking earlier about <i>TheHanky of Pippin’s 
          Daughter</i>, you said you were very clear about the need to unload things, 
          to get rid of this initial impulse of getting it all in. And we talked 
          about that as way of submerging a story that was hard to tell. But here, 
          there is a difference. You don’t have that very personal story to tell. 
          It’s a different field of experience and ideas that you’re drawing from. 
          So one might think there could be a less inhibited impulse to “take it 
          all.” And yet, this is a much sparer book than <i>Hanky</i>. Is this a 
          form of “less is more”? </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I hope so! A smaller book, with a wider frame. 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: You are setting some very active particles in 
          motion which are sort of bouncing off each other and the reader, at least 
          this was my experience, could have a sense of expansiveness, that there 
          was always much more than had glanced onto and off the page. When I put 
          this down my mind was in a very active, connecting mode. I was noticing 
          particles of experience outside your text. It happened that I was reading 
          this at Bard and that I had to put it down at one point to go to a meeting. 
          On my way to the building where the meeting was to occur I realized that 
          I felt as though I were walking through the space in the book, or that 
          the space opened up in the book literally gave onto the world outside 
          it. This was partly the fact that I was walking with the rhythm and method 
          of observing and thinking that <i>is</i> the poetics of this book. I had 
          been initiated into that structural process through the engagement of 
          reading it.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, I’ve had that kind of experience. For instance, 
          with Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge’s work — when I lived a kind of extension of 
          the thought process that she sets going. But, you know, as far as it being 
          a small book, I didn’t plan that. It’s simply that the impulse, the energy 
          that set it in motion gradually wore down.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And yet, you worked on the other book for eight 
          years.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s true. So there are two possibilities: 
          either I went beyond the point when I should have stopped, or the impulse 
          can be there for a long time, even across interruptions. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I wonder too if part of that isn’t that the impulse 
          gets realized somehow. That the impulse gets consumed in the realization. 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That is what one hopes, but one can never be 
          sure.&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I’d like to talk with you, in relation to both 
          of the novels, to all of your work really, about your reference in “Alarms 
          and Excursions” to Georges Bataille’s aesthetic of transgression and glorious 
          waste — excess energy. You are talking about poetry in that essay as a 
          waste of excess energy. Which for Bataille is not limited to poetry; it’s 
          a theory of the excess of art.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Not even limited to art. He puts the Gothic cathedrals 
          and the potlatch ceremony in parallel. Which shocked me at first. The 
          potlatch is no doubt a glorious ritual, but it is sheer destruction. Still, 
          the process, the wasting of energy, is what is glorious whether there 
          remains a result — a cathedral, an artifact — or not. His theory — that 
          the sun’s energy is in excess of maintaining life; so that, when a system 
          can grow no more, the excess energy has to be lost without “profit,” spent 
          gloriously or catastrophically — is the only theory that explains the 
          persistence of art, especially of arts like poetry where there is little 
          tangible “profit.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: You also write about the distinction between 
          the warrior society and the military society.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s also Bataille’s distinction. The military 
          society is a business enterprise that wages war for a purpose, expansion 
          of territory and the like. Whereas the warrior society fights for the 
          heck of it, for the sake of fighting, for the glory of some god. I find 
          it hard to choose between them, except when I think of them as metaphors 
          for artists. Then I join Bataille on the side of the “warrior”: the writer 
          for whom the essential is the writing, the intensity of the process, of 
          the present moment, the glory of making a poem, rather than on the side 
          of the businessman-poet who writes as an investment, building a career. 
          Though nobody can be “pure”...</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Do you see poetry as a more glorious waste than 
          prose?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Definitely. Prose still has a potential of earning 
          money; whereas poetry does not. So, it’s much “purer” waste. True, there 
          are jobs in academe that go to poets. But still, a novelist can theoretically 
          expect to make a living by his work. But not even <i>bad</i> poets can.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: There are one or two exceptions.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Rod McKuen? Kahlil Gibran? </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes. In <i>A Key Into the Language of America</i>, 
          you’ve talked about having found yourself always on the side with the 
          power in various historical contexts. In Germany, you were not a Jew; 
          in the United States you are not a native American. But, there is one 
          quite striking sense in which you are not automatically bequeathed cultural 
          power. You are a woman.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s the kind of contradiction that I try to 
          apply to the conquest of America by Europeans in <i>A Key. </i>My empathy 
          is with both sides. As a woman — and a poet! I am one of the underdogs, 
          but race and education place me among the “conquerors.” This was rubbed 
          in very shortly after I came to the US, in early 1959. When I mentioned 
          to a black fellow student that I was from Germany his comment was: “And 
          you can go anywhere in this country.” One of the things that intrigues 
          me about the conquest of America is that the very masculine Indian culture 
          was put in the position of the conquered female. I’m actually dubious 
          about the gendering of activities, but those archetypes do play into our 
          thinking. The conquest model is the man taking the woman. &nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: What about your role — though you may not think 
          of it in terms of “role” — as a woman writing experimental fiction? I 
          think this is much more unusual right now than a woman writing experimental 
          poetry. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: As you say, I don’t think of it as a role. I’m 
          not a fiction writer. I write. Mostly poems. I try to pay attention to 
          words. Occasionally they push into prose. And maybe it means pushing still 
          a little farther out into the margin.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I have some problems with the “margin” trope. 
          It seems to presuppose a monolithic central text and I don’t think the 
          complexity of our cultural milieu looks like that, but I accept it as 
          your image. So, thinking in terms of marginality, might that be why most 
          women novelists tend not to engage in radical experiments with the form? 
          The novel has been a traditional way up the cultural power ladder for 
          women. And it’s usually a project of much longer duration than a poetry 
          project. It must be additionally frightening to imagine oneself even farther 
          out in the margin <i>and</i> on such a long, precarious, time-consuming 
          exploration.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I don’t think I can speak about “most” women 
          novelists. I’m not even a “novelist.” But there <i>is</i> a distinguished 
          line of women who have experimented with the novel form, from Gertrude 
          Stein on: Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy. 
          Recently Leslie Scalapino, Lyn Hejinian. The term “stream of consciousness 
          novel” was coined by Dorothy Richardson. No, wait, by May Sinclair <i>about</i> 
          Richardson’s work. Whereas now when you mention stream of consciousness 
          novel the reflex is Joyce. But your gendering [elsewhere] of “normative 
          declarations” reminds me: When Charles Bernstein put together the series 
          of talks that was collected as <i>The Politics of Poetic Form,</i> he 
          proposed as starting point a pair of dicta on poets as “legislators”. 
          Shelley’s “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world” and 
          Oppen’s “Poets are the legislators of the unacknowledged world.” Oppen 
          nicely turns Shelley on his head, but neither questions the equation poet 
          = legislator. I found this means nothing to me. I think of poets as language-maintenance 
          crew! Though obviously, while I write I do lay down the rules. At least 
          within the boundaries of my work, I legislate. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, and that role is foregrounded for the innovative 
          writer who is actually inventing some new rules or at least reformulating 
          generic traditions.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But I don’t feel everybody has to do the same 
          thing. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Well, that is your thinking about the world as 
          a multiplicity of individuals writing — the more differences the merrier. 
          But legislative thinking is political and strategic thinking. It’s about 
          marking territory and reorganizing the power structure in the public sphere. 
          Or at least reorienting it to one’s advantage.&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Bataille’s glorious waste again. The essential 
          is the <i>present</i> intensity of the process rather than practical concerns 
          about the <i>future</i>. Of course, at some point we have to help our 
          work find an audience. But<i> while writing</i> it seems essential to 
          keep the business considerations out. To make possible what you are talking 
          about, that reckless freedom. To hell with the audience! Let the dialogue 
          with the language take you wherever it wants. You remember Benjamin’s 
          “Art posits man’s physical and spiritual existence, but in none of its 
          works is it concerned with his response. No poem is intended for the reader, 
          no picture for the beholder, no symphony for the listener.” [This is far 
          from the pressures of the “market place”.] Once, in a Rothko retrospective, 
          I was struck by the division in the work. The early work had an immense, 
          wonderful variety. Then he settled into one basic configuration and explored 
          color. Nelson Howe, the artist friend I was with, attributed this to the 
          art market: once a painting has any success the gallery will insist that 
          you continue in that vein. “That unlucky day,” Morton Feldman called it. 
          On the one hand this seems a terrible limitation, on the other, it can 
          function as a stimulus like any constraint. And of course it’s not possible 
          to sort out the market pressure from all the other factors. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I don’t know. I’ve always assumed that Rothko 
          became very meditative about his work, that he chose this level of exploration 
          for himself. But of course, it’s undeniable that what he chooses to explore 
          at that moment fits very neatly into developing colorist, minimalist movements.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: As we said in the preface to our first anthology, 
          <i>A Century in Two Decades</i>, “It is not denying the importance of 
          ‘movements,’ to insist that there is another importance in moving beside 
          or apart from them.” I may be naive, but I think it is <i>poems</i> that 
          make a difference rather than marketing strategies.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Getting back to Bataille, is it useful to think 
          that any genre has, at any given point in its history, excess energy, 
          energy that hasn’t been used up. Or do some forms become obsolete?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Steve Evans’s <i>The Dynamics of Literary Change 
          </i>goes into this very instructively, in discussing Bourdieu’s <i>The 
          Field of Cultural Production</i>. He sets up a dynamic where the “field” 
          absorbs any number of new “position-takings” until there is a flood of 
          them, which forces redefinition of the field. But there is a third possibility: 
          that the “new” reawakens the genre’s unused, dormant potential, that it 
          “draws out of retirement, as it were, a position that already exists somewhere 
          in the history of the field.” The sonnet-form seems to have such dormant 
          energy that has blossomed recently with Ted Berrigan and Bernadette Mayer. 
          And the novel seems to hang on, even though its death has been proclaimed 
          any number of times.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And yet the novel seems to have developed its 
          most characteristic logics — climactic narrative structure, omniscient 
          author, single point perspective, internally consistent characters, etc. 
          — during that late 18th and full-blown 19th century (extending now into 
          the 21<sup>st</sup> century) period when such constructs were taken to 
          be the unfolding of natural reason. One could, with a certain tunnel vision, 
          find it quite odd that it persists, except perhaps as an aid to nostalgia. 
          Or one might see the current of its energy coming now out of the collision 
          with these very different times, different needs, different senses of 
          ourselves, different clusters contained by possessive pronouns like “our,” 
          different views of the observer and the observed. So, does the excess 
          energy come out of the friction created by these differences? It seems 
          to me to be a kind of “poethical” necessity that there be explorations 
          of the form of the novel that take into account these new sources of energy, 
          and confusion! These are messy things we can’t grasp and package in neat 
          pre-ordained forms without betraying something about how we are experiencing 
          them in the world. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But you keep coming back to a very narrow definition 
          of the novel. The novel is also the least neat, least defined, most elastic 
          genre. By the 1920s, E. M. Forster can’t find anything more precise to 
          say about it than: a narrative of a certain length! If you define it this 
          way it’s impossible to kill off! This is why we can still call “novels” 
          those narratives that don’t fit the Balzac-Flaubert-Dostojewski-Tolstoi 
          model you talk about, but rather fit with your category of the “exploded 
          novel” — or with <i>Tristram Shandy.</i> I recently read two wonderful 
          such “novels.” One is <i>The Christ of Fish</i> by Joel Hoffmann, an Israeli 
          writer. Its structure could be labeled lyrical atomism: extremely short 
          chapters, some only 4 or 5 lines. The narrative line likewise atomized 
          into a mosaic of vignettes. Very little happening. But there are characters. 
          One has a heart “filled with great Hungarian sorrow.” The language is 
          wonderful, full of imaginative leaps that fuse the cosmic and the comic: 
          “Though the Earth was revolving on its axis, the apple strudel was not 
          overturned.” </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The other is a German work, W. G. Sebald’s <i>Rings 
          of Saturn.</i> It is the narrative of a depression which the narrator 
          tries to overcome by going on a walking tour through part of England. 
          It fuses narrative, research into the history of the area he walks through, 
          comments on books, people, mini-essays, quotations both textual and pictorial. 
          In fact, his use of pictures, many of them, is his most obvious way of 
          breaking up the narrative. They are not illustrations, but reference points 
          placed at precise points of the text, sometimes integrated into a sentence. 
          They at first seem to constitute a reality check, a more objective record 
          than writing can be. But this proves deceptive. In the end, they exacerbate 
          the feeling of inability to hold on to “reality.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But back to your Realist novel and how it must struggle 
          and change with changed circumstance. Your comment makes sense of the 
          novel’s history after 1900: that the omniscient narrator was the first 
          to disappear, along with God; that we got limited, “unreliable,” and later 
          fragmented, multiple, viewpoints.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: In <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> there 
          are sort of cameo appearances of the omniscient narrator. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Actually, no. The narrator <i>plays</i> at being 
          omniscient with explicit warnings: “This is conjecture. I <i>am </i>making 
          this up, and as long as I’m making it up I might as well pretend to know 
          what this character thinks!” </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Announcing it as a device.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Years ago, I went to a reading by the novelist 
          Toby Olson. He said afterwards, in the course of discussion, that he felt 
          all the self-consciousness about the constructs of genre was really a 
          waste of time. That these things have always been artifice. The novelist 
          should just go about the business of writing the novel, enjoying the privileges 
          of that artifice.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That it’s all artifice is true enough. I mean, 
          none of the novelists thought they were just mirroring life.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: You think not! Really? </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I know Stendhal <i>claimed</i> that he was just 
          parading a mirror along the highway. But surely he didn’t <i>believe</i> 
          it. How could any writer <i>believe</i> this! Toby Olson is right about 
          the artifice, but the conclusion he draws seems odd — as if there were 
          only one kind of artifice. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: This raises two kinds of issues. One has to do 
          with the way in which certain artificial forms become “naturalized” in 
          the minds of those who use them — both as practitioner and audience. So 
          there can actually be a complete lapse of the memory of the artifice <i>as</i> 
          artifice. Don’t you think there is a sizable portion of the public that 
          believes responsible art, like science, does in fact — or <i>should</i>, 
          if it doesn’t — mirror nature? </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Readers, “the public,” granted. But an artist 
          cannot help knowing it is artifice. Well, no, come to think, there are 
          probably lots of artists who have internalized, “naturalized,” as you 
          — and Forrest-Thomson — say, the artifice to the point of not being aware 
          of it. So many movements have been founded in the name of “nature.” But 
          then, when we say “nature” we have actually shifted ground, away from 
          “reality.” At least since Tasso, since Shakespeare’s time, Aristotle’s 
          mimesis has been interpreted as an imitation of <i>natura naturans, </i>nature 
          in its creative processes, not in its products, <i>natura naturata.</i> 
          But I must also admit that, unlike you, I enjoy some “realistic” narratives 
          if the writing is not too transparent. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Mavis Gallant, 
          William Trevor. Why couldn’t we “take it all”?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Well, good question! Though people seem to have 
          a lot of difficulty moving about between disparate modes and forms. This 
          may have something to do with the uses of art — whether it’s used primarily 
          for relaxation-relief-escape-entertainment or for awakening senses and 
          intellect in relation to, say, history or to one’s contemporary situation 
          in the world....It sounds like you don’t have trouble finding uses for 
          (or better yet, pleasure!) in, many different kinds of forms. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Actually, this is not true in poetry, in my “field.” 
          There, my reading is much narrower. There are not too many current “mainstream” 
          poems that I enjoy. And even those, early Merwin for instance, I don’t 
          go back to very often. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: What about in your publishing? Do you think of 
          Burning Deck as promoting a particular kind of poetry?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, our bias is for the “innovative,” the “explorative.” 
          Though we try to keep an open mind. The books I have been most excited 
          about are books like Mei-mei Berssenbrugge’s <i>Heat Bird</i>, Tina Darragh’s 
          <i>Striking Resemblance,</i> Barbara Guest’s <i>The Countess from Minneapolis</i>, 
          or Pam Rehm’s <i>The Garment In Which No One Had Slept.</i>&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: If you think in terms of “stages of a person’s 
          intellectual development” then you can argue that having gotten to a new 
          stage you must, ipso facto, have thrown off the yoke of the previous one. 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But if you look a little later, you realize that 
          what you have rejected has nevertheless had its effect on you. The lines 
          are never as clean as they are in the manifestos. That’s of course why 
          we value them: they simplify and thus allow you to get a handle on a trend, 
          movement, direction. But the works are never as simple. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: True, the works are trying to do new things in 
          conditions that still contain the impulses of past forms. But another 
          way to think of this is in terms of anxieties. If you think about criticisms 
          of the 19th century novel — and its attendant prose style — as a seamless, 
          airless panopticon it would very rapidly seem that all conventional prose 
          lacks oxygen. While you, on the other hand, move toward prose for <i>more</i> 
          air! This may seem, or actually be, a real contradiction in the world 
          of innovative writing. But supposing the description of conventional prose 
          as hermetic is actually a self-description on the part of the reader, 
          a description of the anxiety she feels when she finds herself being sucked 
          into a skillfully constructed, logically possible world whose grounding 
          is the erasure of the collisions and swerves and improbabilities of complex 
          real life. Of course, as you may guess, I entirely identify with this 
          since my addicted use of the novel as a teenager was precisely to flee 
          a world that I didn’t want to face or be part of. And retrospectively 
          feeling that all this novel reading was most definitely <i>not</i> a preparation 
          for real life!</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: No, but it was an alternative to daydreaming 
          and more <i>vital, </i>being vicarious experience. You <i>needed</i> to 
          do exactly that. Just as we need to dream. Nobody could stand conscious 
          life 24 hours a day!</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: That’s true. It’s not that I would wind back 
          the reel and say, “You may not read those novels!” </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: It was also an experience of form — even if that 
          form now stifles you. At this point in my life I read at a sort of micro 
          level, I read for the language, the style, the texture.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And not the story at all?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Well, how can one disentangle them? But I get 
          very impatient with any writing that doesn’t have good sentences. Several 
          friends had recommended <i>The Golden Notebook</i> by — what’s her name 
          —</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Doris Lessing.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Such scope! they said. But the sentences were 
          atrociously dull — I couldn’t read it and never got to that great scope! 
          Whereas when I open a book and the first sentence is: “When I heard that 
          Isaac Kornfeld, a man of piety and brains, had hanged himself in the public 
          park, I put a token in the subway stile and journeyed out to see the tree,” 
          I’ll definitely read on. This is Cynthia Ozick’s “Pagan Rabbi.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Well, when as a teenager I read Thomas Mann — 
          in translation — I loved the prose, I loved the story, the “vision,” the 
          intellectual Romanticism. I don’t think I could read it now. In fact I’m 
          grateful for whatever led me to read it then; otherwise I would have missed 
          it entirely. I’m too suspicious of that intellectual Romanticism now.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: What is it that you read for now? What keeps 
          you interested?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I don’t read novels at all any more. Yours, and 
          just a few others — mostly by poets — have been an exception just because 
          they <i>are</i> an exception to those elements that stifle me. I like 
          stylistic strategies that undermine the authority of the writer while 
          clearly partaking of her intelligence. What I do love is the complex interplay 
          of fragmentary glimpses — a polylectic, polylogical play — all of which 
          does have a cumulative effect larger than the sum of the parts, but always 
          an unexpected one. And, because of the fragmentation — the invitation 
          to the reader to participate in making sense of things — and the complexity, 
          each reading is a new reading in some truly significant sense. I find 
          this mostly in poetry, since poetry can include everything these days, 
          even prose — but prose fragments. Otherwise, for the security of predictable, 
          but interesting sentences that are reassuring — I admit I want that too 
          — things I can take to bed at night, I read biographies and autobiographies, 
          essays, Buddhist texts, newspapers, French magazines...Though, having 
          said all that, when I read <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> I was 
          interested in the story, but only because that story is wrenched out of 
          the conventions of the well-crafted novel and placed within a delightfully, 
          humorously rigged scaffold. There is an evocation of a very specific culture 
          and historical period in your book that entirely resists being cast into 
          the kind of grandiose metanarrative that one finds in Thomas Mann. I recoil 
          from such things now, in a way I certainly didn’t as a teenager — then, 
          the more grandiose the better! </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But the fun with Mann is that he always undermines 
          his “grandiosity,” even in his style. Always overdoing it to the point 
          of absurdity. Never one adjective, always at least three! &nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: What would be a recent example of a novel that 
          you’ve enjoyed? </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Mostly I reach for authors like Clarice Lispector, 
          the Brazilian novelist. Do you know her?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I do — <i>The Foreign Legion, The Hour of the 
          Star</i>...They’ve been highly recommended. In fact I picked up remaindered 
          copies, but I confess I haven’t been able to read them. What do you like 
          in her work? She’s writing about another world too —</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: She spans quite a bit of territory. Some of her 
          stories are really extensions of modernist stories, extensions of what 
          could almost be a Thomas Mann story, except for going more into microstructures. 
          The longer works can be fairly abstract, like <i>Aqua Viva</i>, a meditation 
          on the creative process. But maybe the most extreme work is <i>The Passion 
          According to G.H.</i> in which all that “happens” is that a woman kills 
          a cockroach.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Ah, after “The Metamorphosis”! </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: And has a mystical experience! A total vision 
          of life, death, everything. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Does the murder take place on the first page, 
          followed by the unfolding vision?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: No, the two are completely integrated. Actually 
          there’s also a drawing on the wall. A “dirty” drawing, of stick figures 
          having sexual intercourse, which provides the frame. But disgust with 
          the cockroach, killing the cockroach and then contemplating the little 
          bit of white cockroach viscosity seeping out takes up the whole (very 
          short) novel. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: So then the language has to be everything.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s it. The language and getting at the functioning 
          of the mind, the thought process.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Do you have the book here? Could you pull it 
          out, to find an example of that texture?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I have it only in a French translation. We first 
          discovered Lispector in French. But it has been translated into English 
          also. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I’m still looking for an example of the actual 
          language that you’re finding of interest and exciting in those terms — 
          of texture. Without an example, it’s hard to have a feeling for it.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But actually a short example wouldn’t quite do 
          it, because the astonishing thing is that she can keep it going up to 
          novel length, and it keeps being fascinating. The structure is interesting 
          too — it’s in very short chapters, about two pages long, and the last 
          sentence is always the first sentence of the next chapter. It’s as if 
          taking a breath and then continuing from where you left off. It makes 
          for a very nice rhythm.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: That’s also the form of a “crown” of sonnets. 
          Was she a poet as well?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I don’t think so. Of course I only know what’s 
          been translated. But nearly every novelist has a poetry skeleton in the 
          closet. &nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I thought it would be interesting for you to 
          think aloud about the relationship between fact and fiction in your work 
          — the inventing that is fiction, that etymologically seems to have something 
          to do with “touching” — touching perhaps things that don’t become audible, 
          visible in the constructs we call “factual.” Though there is a different 
          use of “fact” — those that give the invented fiction a sort of documentary 
          aspect, an historical context, say. I ask this particularly with respect 
          to <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> because what I experience as 
          a ratio of “need to relate” to “need to invent” is so charged with constructive 
          energy there.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: There is a lot going on in your phrase of “touching 
          things that don’t become audible, visible in the constructs we call factual.” 
          It’s a good answer to the “mirroring” claim we talked about. It also reminds 
          me of Adorno’s — let me find the quote: “Art does not recognize reality 
          by reproducing it photographically, but by voicing that which is veiled 
          by the empirical forms of reality.” I prefer your active fingers to his 
          more clichéd unveiling. The “touching” in the etymology of fiction seems 
          to be touching clay, hence forming, shaping. So to continue your image, 
          it would be by shaping, molding the clay of “fact,” that fiction can make 
          perceptible things not perceptible otherwise. This means treating as “clay” 
          what is already a construct, i.e. first of all destroying it (to avoid 
          the word “deconstruct!”). </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And that is, I suspect, where the energy comes from. 
          The need to tell is rather a need to destroy, and the need to invent, 
          a need to reconstruct, differently.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the <i>Hanky</i>, some things are presented as 
          fact and others as speculation. But that is a fictional distinction. Actually, 
          I was thinking back to the “realistic” novel. It also treats “fact” as 
          clay. Realism is a technique like any other. It foregrounds other things 
          than a collage technique does, say, or the studies in “voice,” Coover 
          and Hawkes, for instance. But “reality” in any case — it’s one of those 
          big, vague words I’m uncomfortable with, as you must be also. I mean, 
          what <i>is</i> fact?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: We might discuss your wonderful headings in <i>The 
          Reproduction of Profiles</i>: Facts, Thinkable Pictures, Feverish Propositions, 
          If Words Are Signs, Successive Applications. This seems to me a perfectly 
          complete uncertain epistemological universe! </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Well, there you have it. With some thanks to 
          Wittgenstein.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Then, to evade that question, I suppose it would 
          be interesting to try to trace the genesis of the impulse to tell a story. 
          A story that comes out of your life experience — a good deal of it lived 
          outside of books. A good deal in. But your family experience, say, forming 
          part of that drive to tell a story, to <i>make</i> a story. Actually, 
          when you talk about “telling” a story it’s as if — </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: It existed already. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, so to “make” a story of it. And memories 
          become part of the material with which you work, as well as information 
          of various kinds — about music, about meteorology, scientific measurement, 
          historical events...A sub-universe of knowledge and imaginative transformation. 
          Making a kind of mosaic picture from bits and fragments. One might ask, 
          Why do this?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Memory is problematic, as uncertain as I claim 
          in the book. I was telling somebody about the wonderfully sinister ending 
          of Hitchcock’s <i>The Birds </i>— when the couple gets back to San Francisco, 
          there’s the Golden Gate Bridge with <i>birds</i> all over it. Keith looked 
          at me, “This is not the way it ends; it is how Hitchcock <i>wanted</i> 
          to end it. You have <i>read </i>this.” I was stunned. I had such a vivid 
          visual image of it in my mind! Now, this has become a joke between us. 
          If I remember something <i>very clearly</i>, it’s certainly false. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Do you think there’s some kind of pattern, in 
          a story for instance, that you may feel a need to construct because of 
          personal experience? Is there some sort of pattern, if not specific detail, 
          that has to remain intact for the charge to be there, or perhaps some 
          sort of pattern that has to change? I think again of that wonderful sentence 
          on the cover of <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter </i>— “The drive to 
          know our own story moves us to see through it and touch the violence inherent 
          in the mechanism itself.” Is there some sort of boundary pattern that 
          must be there precisely in order to not betray the violence of “the mechanism 
          itself” — whatever that might be? You’ve said that for eight years you 
          were trying to figure out a way — </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: You’re not letting me off with a joke! OK. I’m 
          serious that the impulse to tell comes out of the impulse to destroy, 
          to change — even if it is with the idea of coming to know, of gaining 
          clarity through the process of formulating. But memory does this anyway. 
          My computer has a glitch. If I use the “insert date” function and 2 weeks 
          later want to check when I wrote the letter: the moment I open the file, 
          the date changes to the <i>current</i> date. Memory is like this. Every 
          time we “access” a memory we alter it, re-construct it, so that it becomes 
          more and more fictional as time goes on. The fact of observation changes 
          the data observed. This is the “violence inherent in the mechanism,” be 
          it remembering, thinking about, observing, analyzing. In writing <i>The 
          Hanky,</i> the important moment was when I began to foreground this doubt, 
          when I found this form that dips in and out, goes into “story,” then draws 
          back to the narrator’s uncertainties, then takes another dip. Once I got 
          that rhythm, things started to happen, the fragments started coming together. 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: So the rhythm was one of launching out to write 
          about characters and interactions between characters and then — </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: drawing back into doubts, self-consciousness. 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: What roles did the musical and meteorological 
          metaphors play in this rhythm?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Music was part of the material, an important 
          thing in the family. Which is why I made the narrator a musician. A friend 
          of mine said, “How German of you. You present music as if it could explain 
          anything! What a German idea!”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, music is the Art of the Soul! in German 
          tradition, isn’t it? The picture I have from all my early years (my wasted 
          adolescence again!) of going to concerts, hearing mainly German music 
          — Bach, Haydn, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert — was that the hall was filled 
          with people (myself included) who felt the music was filling them with 
          great ideas, with a grand and immense <i>felt</i> knowledge. Now I see 
          that we didn’t learn anything at all — except about the patterns of the 
          music itself, that we didn’t walk out any the wiser for having those vibrations 
          strike our eardrums. We had felt a lot, but...it reminds me of Wittgenstein’s 
          question, “How would you respond if someone said, I think it merely strikes 
          you that you know that?” I remember reading a wonderful description of 
          this. The picture was of the “souls” of the concert audience being steadily 
          inflated by the music, hanging over them like enormous hot air balloons. 
          The concert ends and you try not to hear the sssssssssssssssssssssss! 
          I think of it as a very particular repetition compulsion — the continual 
          climb to climaxes — audible alpinisms — particularly in the Romantic period.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That sounds like Musil, possibly. It is curious 
          how immediate music seems although it is time-based arts, just like language 
          arts. With a poem you must at least read all the way through to the end. 
          You may even need more time to reflect, to hold it for a while. Of course 
          in music, too, it takes a while to get the form, but there’s an immediate 
          “attack” on the emotions, even before it gets to the alpinism! What a 
          great phrase! Of course, what we just listened to, the Cage piece, gets 
          away from that. In the novel, I use both the meteorology and the music 
          in terms of emotional atmosphere. I suppose I give the technical details 
          sometimes to make it funny, but mostly to undercut just that effect of 
          “creating atmosphere” — </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, yes — and it’s the terrifying continuity 
          and consistency of that atmosphere that again renders me short of breath.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, so instead I look at the technical details 
          that <i>make up</i> atmosphere. There’s more about how the hammers in 
          the piano work than about music. As I enumerate, in <i>A Form</i>, how 
          the muscles in Montezuma’s arm work — going to the mechanism behind the 
          phenomenon. Still intending the emotions, of course. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And then there’s Josef [in <i>Hanky</i>] who 
          is himself so preoccupied with atmospherics and measurements. The recurrent 
          gesture for him is tapping his finger on the barometer. So is this the 
          play within the play of the narrative metaphor? Josef, the character, 
          is doing with his life what Waldrop, the writer is doing with the novel? 
          You are also tapping your fingers on various mechanisms. I find this interesting 
          as an intersection of the form of life of the character, genre, and writer. 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, yes, exactly. He can never figure out his 
          wife — her emotional barometer! </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: As you can’t really figure out your characters, 
          or this particular knotty history. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I’m reminded of Russians I’ve known who talk 
          about how they’re feeling in terms of the barometer. In fact, they seem 
          to think constantly about barometric pressure while monitoring daily fluctuations 
          in their health. Americans don’t think that way. Do Germans do that?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes. The air pressure is thought to have a very 
          direct influence. Well, in Munich there is a particular wind, the “Fšhn,” 
          which gives enormous headaches to many people, including me. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Similar to the Mistral? I’ve heard it referred 
          to as a source of headaches and insanity. Perhaps because of the relentlessness 
          of it, keeping people constantly on edge.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Music is of course part of the cultural atmosphere. 
          It can give us different kinds of headaches.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, sound surrounds us. We move in it as we 
          do in weather. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: There are some very specific details about performance 
          of particular pieces in <i>Hanky</i>. Are those details functioning metaphorically?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: If I’m thinking of the same passages, e.g. about 
          formal control versus “letting go,” yes. Metaphors for problems of writing.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: There’s a moment in<i> Hanky </i>— on page 25 
          — when Josef walks over to the barometer and the needle is pointing to 
          “steady.” It seems clear at that point that this is an indicator of — 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: the relationship, yes. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: It seemed to me the “pathetic fallacy” once removed, 
          mediated by an instrument. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Exactly! </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: In <i>A Form/ of Taking/ It All</i> you write 
          about the need to make our own connections: “The importance of connecting 
          it all into a cosmos which opens out like the splendid white flower from 
          the red disk of that fall-blooming annual. Metaphor, she mumbles. Half 
          my life I’ve spent connecting perceptions this way, by analogy. But the 
          flower I’d have skipped. Only a scientist can afford such hackneyed comparisons. 
          She accepts, though, that without our connecting them into a picture the 
          dots are not even visible, that being real means having form. Metaphor, 
          muscles, telescopes, travelers.” (17)</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Uh huh! I think I would stand by that. It’s only 
          in relation that anything makes any sense. We talked about Olson’s: what 
          matters is not things, but what happens <i>between</i> them. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I think the interesting question for me as a 
          reader, and as a writer, is how much needs to be connected <i>in</i> the 
          writing? To what degree can those dots describe many possible relationships, 
          a kind of choreography where the constantly <i>changing</i> relational 
          tension between them is the source of the energy? Where it’s not only 
          that there need not be fixed lines drawn, but that to draw them would 
          be to skewer the butterfly so to speak, to kill it in order to study it, 
          rather than to live with it while observing it’s quirky movements in nature, 
          accepting that it might get away.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: OK, I’m with you that the connection had better 
          not be too explicit. But one still has to create a <i>tension</i> between 
          the dots which they might not have on their own. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I’m not sure there’s really tension in connection 
          — the connection that’s already been made. Tension seems to me to come 
          from the moving parts, the uncertainties in relational principles like 
          juxtaposition.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: True, but juxtaposition <i>is</i> a connection.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Well, I’m not so sure about that. Maybe there 
          is a significant difference between connection and relationship. I think 
          a really vital relationship is entirely a matter of context and, if the 
          context is rich enough, there is a constant transforming dialectic in 
          process between particular and particular, context and particular elements, 
          etc. and I really think this is of a different order from connection which 
          — to my mind — has to do with stopping the motion, fixing things in place, 
          tying them together, pinning them down.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Well if you’re defining connection in this way...I 
          was rather talking about syntax in the large sense, the way which elements 
          are placed next to which others on the page. (Which does not exhaust the 
          ways they will rearrange themselves in the mind of the reader.) Not anything 
          juxtaposed with anything will automatically have tension. Some juxtapositions 
          are inert, don’t have the potential to spark. And there is the additional 
          problem that two juxtaposed items might be inert for me, but might have 
          enormous tension for you — the same two things.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes. And that’s entirely relational, isn’t it? 
          The relation to the associational contexts I or you bring along as readers 
          or writers. But also, because this comes down to the form of attention, 
          of noticing, that we bring to a text, there is the issue of the way in 
          which that text itself educates, or even “initiates” the reader’s attention 
          so that s/he can notice a range of things unimaginable before the act 
          of reading began. Perhaps this is best done Venn diagram style — areas 
          that overlap just a bit, or barely graze one another, but that do actually 
          touch if only tangentially...These stretch our observational field and 
          then, having warmed up our metaphorical muscles we are capable of reaching 
          for relations that didn’t overlap prior to our coming in as participant 
          observer, collaborator. With this new geometry of attention, we begin 
          to find ourselves making connections, noting tensions that the author 
          may not have had in mind at all. As we do, after all, all the time in 
          “real-life” space, time and chaos, yes/no?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Theoretically. Though in “real life” we can’t 
          muster that kind of attention all the time — it would create an overload 
          and we would — well — explode. Indifference may be a necessary defense.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: But isn’t that why art <i>is in fact</i> different 
          from everyday life? — that in the artifice of an abbreviated space-time 
          frame we can afford to risk a heightened attention that might be quite 
          awkward as a daily constant? Of course the encounter with a text is also 
          the encounter with an “other” mind, a mind — thank god — not our own, 
          another culture, ethos, form of life...and that means, to the extent that 
          what has been written is not formulaic or imitatively generic or safely 
          conventional, there will always be a need for initiation. I think readers 
          forget this. The idea of instant accessibility overlooks what every high 
          school teacher used to say about one’s first attempt at a Russian novel: 
          “The first chapter will be very hard, but if you persist it will teach 
          you how to read the rest of the book.” This is true of all literature 
          removed from one’s immediate experience. The first few minutes of a Shakespearean 
          play are hard, then you get “used to” the language. That the same holds 
          true for contemporary experimental literature might be a useful revelation. 
          In reading <i>A Form/ of Taking /It All </i>your obsessions and preoccupations 
          — which were definitely not all mine at the outset — the things that led 
          you to make the connections and juxtapositions and relationships that 
          you constructed, initiated <i>me</i> as a reader into the new world of 
          your text, <i>it’s</i> gravitational and electromagnetic and strong and 
          weak nuclear forces as well as incidents having to do with the New World 
          of the Americas, the new worlds of science, etc. that the text is “about.” 
          Pretty soon the reader is skipping along discovering and making connections 
          with ecstatic delight! What this means is that the process of reading 
          had so refocused, reoriented my thinking that by the time I got to page 
          50 — where you are simply juxtaposing, supplying fewer connections between 
          things — I was entirely ready to play. In this new constellation.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Great! </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: In <i>The Hanky</i> on page 119 you write, “Outside 
          the story all the sentences are possible, whereas inside, a ‘then’ brings 
          out unexpected threads and lines of force. But there are obvious holes 
          where all that escapes the story looks on. These holes eventually show 
          through. More and more, here, unnerving me. The words land, without warning, 
          among cries and Siegheils.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, at the beginning, there are infinite possibilities. 
          But as soon as you put down one element you start limiting the options. 
          A “then” implies a temporal sequence, maybe even a causal one, which is 
          what the novel supposedly works with. But the holes are actually more 
          important. The holes, all that escapes the story, the unrealized potential 
          of the narrative. They acknowledge the limits of the artifice and pit 
          it against the stronger presence , here, of history. Even when not talked 
          about, history is present, looks on. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And the form with the holes allows it to look 
          on, allows that permeability to what cannot be contained in the story.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes. This gets us back to your favorite bugbear, 
          the closed universe of the traditional novel. The holes are extremely 
          important.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Seeking the closed novel is in a sense seeking 
          to be protected from history.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Right.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, this brings to mind another passage in <i>The 
          Hanky, </i>captioned “HOLD ON, ANDREA, I HAVE MORE DOCUMENTS.” Then goes 
          on, “A registered letter from <i>Kreisleiter </i>Müller. A summons, rather. 
          Copies of letters Josef wrote. A scene with Müller I remember by my terror 
          though, at the time, I didn’t know what it was about. And there is my 
          Latin teacher, Professor Acker, who was arrested by the Nazis. Little 
          islands. If I join them all it makes a plot. But should they be joined? 
          The real story is the water washing around them.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Another image in the same direction.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: “And can I get any closer to it if I make myself 
          immobile, without ideas or point of view? So that I disappear into that 
          element of the story which is me: Lucy Seifert, the third daughter. Still 
          unborn at this point”(128).</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I guess I was quite preoccupied with definitions 
          of the novel — the attempt at objectivity wasn't working, but present 
          as something to be played against.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: We were talking about gestures yesterday — their 
          abbreviation lightens the baggage of the conventional novel. And this 
          lightness of form that you bring, instead of the heavily panting plot, 
          makes me think now of the recurrent image of the hanky floating in air. 
          It comes about eleven times in the course of the book, an interesting 
          anti-gravitational display — Pippin's daughter waving it, or it’s floating 
          on its own, occasionally landing. What is that about? Of course it begins 
          in the title; it is <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i>.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I thought of the hanky story as an example of 
          the violent reduction, the foreshortening that we do in fiction, in history, 
          in our daily lives. Our way of constructing a manageable reality out of 
          the overwhelming welter of details. Form = radical exclusion. The whole 
          life of King Pippin’s daughter gets reduced to the one gesture of losing 
          a handkerchief — and that preserved only in a local legend about the founding 
          of a town that does not even bear her name, but that of shepherd Kitz 
          who found the hanky!</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Hmm. Interesting. You yourself are writing as 
          a daughter. So are you waving this book lightly, dropping it as your floating 
          gesture?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Hoping that somebody will pick it up! </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: How early did you know this story?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: It seems I’ve always known “how the town of Kitzingen 
          got it’s name.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: As a child did you wonder about her, about the 
          daughter herself?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I know I wondered why it is the shepherd’s name 
          rather than the daughter’s name. But then he <i>found</i> the hanky; she 
          just <i>lost </i>it! The utilitarian spirit! </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Hmm. Interesting, the woman’s loss — the gossamer 
          hanky — marks the spot for the man to plant the flag — hanky secured to 
          a pole — and say “I name this Kitzingen!” Or, thinking about <i>A Key 
          Into the Language of America,</i> it’s the diminished — feminized? — natives 
          — </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Losing.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, their loss enables the taking possession, 
          the re-naming. One could wonder about this, this disappearance of the 
          feminine element as precondition for certain kinds of possessive violence 
          — the consecration of the Fatherland.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: This sounds good, but in the specific case of 
          my Kitzingen legend, this male-female hierarchy is complicated by the 
          social hierarchy which goes in the opposite direction: a noblewoman and 
          a shepherd. </p>
