            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lola Ridge’s first book was published when she 
              was 41; she emigrated to the United States from Australia as a divorced 
              woman, and routinely cut as much as ten years off her age. She lived 
              in the U.S. for over a decade before a major publisher released her 
              volume, <i>The Ghetto And Other Poems</i>. What did Ridge do earlier 
              in life? What kind of influences did she experience? When did she 
              begin to write? </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Leaving her first husband and New Zealand, Ridge 
              traveled to Sydney, Australia, where she began art studies with Julian 
              Ashton, a painter and forebear of the Julian Ashton who would ultimately 
              rename his school the Julian Ashton School. She is said to have supported 
              herself as an artist’s model and illustrator. About this time, she 
              must have begun writing poems under the nickname “Lola.” She completed 
              a 93-page manuscript which she gave to Alfred George Stephens, a prominent 
              editor and promoter of Australian literature who ran “The Red Page” 
              of the popular newspaper, <i>The Bulletin</i>.<span
  class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> [2]</a> Under the aegis of <i>The Bulletin</i>, he also 
              published poetry collections and is known for publishing the first 
              volumes of many fine Australian poets.<span
  class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> [3]</a> Among the books Stephens published were three by 
              bush poet and lyric poet John Shaw Neilson, the poet who wrote the 
              manuscript stored at the Mitchell Library with Lola Ridge’s <i>Verses</i>.<span
  class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> [4]</a> A.G. Stephens’ 
              papers are in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. 
              While the poems in Ridge’s manuscript may have been published in Australian 
              journals, newspapers, or in chapbook form, I have found none. Ridge 
              left Australia for San Francisco in 1907, two or three years after 
              the completion of this manuscript.</span></span></span></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">The poems in 
              <i>Verses</i> are long verses, poems written using iambic pentameter 
              arrayed in a survey of stanza lengths and rhyme schemes. One reason 
              the apprentice prosody in this manuscript is important to read is 
              that the first three books Ridge published in New York (starting some 
              fifteen years after she wrote <i>Verses</i>) are mostly free verse. 
              With the sonnets in <i>Red Flag</i>, her third book, she returned 
              to rhyme and meter. She followed that book with a book-length poem, 
              <i>Firehead</i>, and a sonnet sequence in <i>Dance of Fire</i>, her 
              last book. Ridge’s return to traditional form was partly a response 
              to Arthur Kreymborg, who encouraged a generation of politically active 
              poets to write miserable ballads and sappy sonnets. It was also a 
              return to her poetical roots. </span></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">There is a 
              loose category of Australian poetry which is not very familiar to 
              me, but seems necessary to consider when thinking about <i>Verses</i>, 
              that of bush poetry. Bush poetry is not like American cowboy poetry, 
              although some contemporary bush poetry is like contemporary American 
              cowboy poetry, with its humor, doggerel, and slang. Bush poetry readership 
              and poets are obviously not only people with a particular job description 
              or people in a particular region; bush poetry might be usefully, if 
              problematically, termed working class pastoral. It is limited to people 
              who write about a particular ecology and economy. Bush poetry might 
              be compared to western American poetry from the 1880s into the 1930s 
              which focussed on the deserts, grasslands, and prairies. That earnest 
              Lola Ridge, writing in Sydney, born in Dublin, raised in the gold 
              fields of New Zealand, would be writing something that participates 
              in the tradition of bush poetry is a little surprising. She carried 
              many of the traditions of bush poetry to a New Zealand landscape, 
              which is to say, out of the bush, by mentioning Lake Kanieri, New 
              Zealand, and Tuhua, a volcanic island off the coast of New Zealand. 
              Like John Shaw Neilson, Ridge writes a lyric bush poetry. It is perhaps 
              significant that her manuscript should be housed with John Shaw Neilson, 
              who brought to bush poetry some of the first influences of modernism. 
              </span></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">Another little 
              surprise awaiting the reader of <i>Verses</i> is the way in which 
              the poetry, and older bush poetry, compares and contrasts to the feminized 
              genteel poetry written in America at this time. Genteel poetry largely 
              addresses or approaches a set of subjects which include death, particularly 
              the death of children, aspects of family religious belief under female 
              control, and female domestic culture as opposed to domestic work. 
              Some of the best genteel poetry of the American West is Helen Hunt 
              Jackson’s writing on plants. Some of the best older bush poetry also 
              realistically depicts nature, forming a natural symbolism. Ridge feminizes 
              the bush as she struggles to find a female lyric voice.</span></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">The first section 
              of <i>Verses</i>, entitled “Voices of the Bush,” begins with the mood-setting 
              “Under-Song.” In 1918, she would include a heavily revised version 
              of this poem in her first book, <i>The Ghetto and Other Poems</i>. 
              The original ending couplet, “The meaning of the song / He faintly 
              hears,” contains the only gendered pronoun in the early draft of the 
              poem, indicating that the reader and interpreter of the bush’s song 
              is male, while the singer of the song, described in the opening couplet, 
              “The mystical, the strong / Deep throated Bush” is the author, Ridge. 
              The second poem in the early manuscript, “At Sun-Down,” begins, “The 
              bush is leaning like a tired child, / Her dear head nestling on the 
              breast of night,” indicating that all parts of nature are female. 
              The bush remains female in the rest of the poems. In the overtly erotic 
              “The Bush,” Ridge begins, “The gay winds fondle with the maiden Bush”: 
              the winds and day are male, but everything earth-bound remains female. 
              While this may seem to be obvious mythography, it is neither a bush 
              poetry or genteel poetry commonplace. Additionally, Ridge was a divorced 
              “New Woman” artist and writer, neither the active wife of a miner 
              nor a mother at home. She would go on, in New York, to be active in 
              such feminist projects as Margaret Sanger’s <i>Birth Control Review</i>. 
              She would also continue to feminize the earth and sea, and maintain 
              the maleness of the wind.</span></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">The second 
              section of <i>Verses</i>, entitled “Songs of the Sluicers,” is based 
              on Ridge’s experiences in the gold fields of New Zealand. Later in 
              her career, she will drop the rhyme in her longer poems. Description 
              such as, “the red light from the lant’rns / Lit the faces round the 
              shaft,” will remain. The dialog will go, but Ridge will remain interested 
              in telling slang, unfortunate dialect, and their evil twin, poeticized 
              or heightened language. Toward the end of <i>Verses</i> there are 
              poems which are like bush poetry, humorous rhyming doggerel in slang, 
              but set in the gold fields, not in the bush: “Helblatavesky’s Cow,” 
              which references Madame Blavatsky in its final reference to a golden 
              calf, contains silly puns and slang. Mining, the causes of miners, 
              and marked descriptions of mining equipment and metals continues throughout 
              Ridge’s work. Her half realist-half lyric description of miners and 
              mining begins in <i>Verses. </i>Writing about gold mining allows Ridge 
              to combine her search for real and emotionally moving political actions 
              with her lyricism of light. The labor union organizations and strikes 
              Ridge experienced when first coming to America were miners’ unions 
              and coal and copper mining strikes. Her later writing about mining 
              allows her to write from memory as well as prophetically.</span></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">An additional 
              aspect of this unpublished text is that it contains two versions of 
              two poems, “The Flame Flower” and “Song of the Earth [Spirit].” The 
              text is consecutively numbered, including the revisions, but there 
              are markings in the text which indicate them, such as “see page 44.” 
              These revisions are “signed” in typescript “Lola Ridge,” and after 
              the last of them, the second draft of “Song of the Earth,” entitled 
              “Song of the Earth Sprit,” is the note, “I revised these pieces last 
              night &amp; as they seem to sound better am sending you the copy.” 
              The revisions are not major. For example, “The Flame Flower” is in 
              a male voice. A line is revised, “Well men are lust driven fools.” 
              to “We men are desire driven fools!”</span></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">Many of the 
              poems toward the revisions and the center of the manuscript, either 
              in the right margin, at the end, or in a stanza break towards the 
              bottom of the page, bear the annotations “Royal 42th / ‘H.M. Greville,’” 
              “Super Royal 52th / ‘H.M. Greville,’” or “Imperial 78th / ‘H.M. Greville.’” 
              These seem to be addresses of British Army units stationed in Sydney 
              harbor. For example, the Royal 42th is The Black Watch of Scottish 
              Highlanders. I don’t know Ridge’s relationship to the H.M. Greville, 
              and cannot find a record of a ship with that name. British army units 
              at that time did act as gold escorts.</span></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><i>Verses</i> 
              by Lola Ridge remains a hard-to-find text which will not enter the 
              public domain in the U.S. until 2011, and will not enter the public 
              domain in Australia until Australian copyright laws change. Yet the 
              poems and annotations reveal a great deal about Ridge’s development 
              as a poet, her travels and living situation, and early reception history. 
              She was a poet of considerable dedication, writing a long manuscript 
              using a variety of stanza forms and poetic techniques. These poems 
              are not occasional verse or a mere sampler, but represent an attempt 
              to feminize and even eroticize nature in poetry, to bring the situations 
              she experienced in the gold fields of New Zealand to Australia, and 
              to write in a female voice as well as a male voice. The poems show 
              her attacking the problems of writing poems as a heterosexual woman, 
              such as the problems of voice when describing nature as a woman in 
              lyric and in narrative poetry. She was a poet of sufficient stature 
              in Australia that she was able to submit an entire volume of poems 
              to the leading poetry editor of the time and place.</span></p>
