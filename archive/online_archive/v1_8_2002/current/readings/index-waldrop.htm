        questions of canon formation, public access, the reviewing process, etc. 
        These writings may be original or reprinted (by permission), and will 
        include conference papers relevant to the HOW2 project. Reflections on 
        the poem-making process are encouraged, as well as more formal essays. 
        Bios and photos are always requested; when they don't appear, it is at

      <P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="CENTER">“Truth While Climbing the Stairs” — A Rosmarie 
        Waldrop Section</p>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Edited and Introduced by Kornelia Freitag</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>The need to tell is rather a need to destroy, 
        and the need to invent a need to reconstruct, differently</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#8212;thus Rosmarie Waldrop characterizes the activity 
        of writing in a conversation with Joan Retallack.which is published in 
        this section. Waldrop’s own exploration of the destructive and the reconstructive 
        power of writing has led to fascinating linguistic experiments which blend 
        philosophy, mundane affairs, history, autobiography, and feminist critique. 
        The scope of her writing — which reflects the scope of her reading — invites 
        spontaneous reactions as well as in-depth theoretical analysis. I have 
        seen audiences roar with laughter while she was reading her poetry and 
        I have had students debating heatedly the intricacies of one line in a 
        poem by her.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The beginning of her long prose poem <i>The Reproduction 
        of Profiles</i> (1987) indicates what is meant in the introductory quote:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>I had inferred from pictures that the world was real and therefore 
          paused, for who knows what will happen if we talk truth while climbing 
          the stairs.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This is not just a play on Wittgenstein and Kafka, 
        it literally <b>destroys</b> the quotes from <i>The Philosophical Investigations</i> 
        and from the narrative fragment “Description of a Struggle” to<b> reconstruct</b> 
        them<b> differently</b>. By recycling two texts by canonized male authors 
        in her own poetry Waldrop re<b>invent</b>s the literary canon to <b>tell</b> 
        what she detects and / or finds lacking in it. She undermines generic 
        boundaries, questions traditional wisdom, and subverts authority. Like 
        her speaker in the lines above she pauses and interrogates — but she is 
        not interested in setting new rules and regulations. As she has pointed 
        out before and repeats in the interview:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>. . . the equation poet = legislator . . . means nothing to me. I think 
          of poets as language maintenance crew.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And Waldrop carries her linguistic maintenance work 
        to perfection by making language soar, similes swerve, and meaning multiply. 
        Her poetry and prose is not the illustration of some academic talk on 
        “indeterminacy,” “metafiction,” and “differance” but performs and ironizes 
        these concepts at one and the same time. Far from being ascetic intellectual 
        exercises, Waldrop’s texts are truly captivating. It’s not just polite 
        rhetoric when some of the poets and critics who contributed to this section 
        describe being literally drawn <i>into</i> Waldrop’s texts: “as though 
        . . . walking through the space in the book” (Retallack) or having “the 
        sense that I’m standing inside the words themselves” (Lurie). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This absorbing yet open concept of Waldrop’s work 
        invites different readings, interpretations, and comments. In the following 
        section a whole range of interpretative possibilities becomes obvious: 
        First Waldrop and Joan Retallack discuss the poetics underlying <i>The 
        Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> and <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>. 
        This is the second half of a conversation between the two fellow poets, 
        begun in 1991. The first part of the conversation (not reprinted here) 
        was published in <i>Contemporary Literature</i> 40.3 (Fall 1999) — so 
        it is about time the second part came out! The abrupt end of the following 
        transcript may well be taken to symbolize the incompleteness of any discussion 
        of Waldrop’s texts. Here it leads to six analytical essays. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The first three essays work to situate Waldrop within 
        the terrain of feminist linguistic experimentation. Kimberly Lamm uses 
        Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of minor literature to analyze the way 
        in which Waldrop’s <i>A Key into the Language of America</i> interrogates 
        the gender and sexual politics of Early American writing. In a carefully 
        balanced analysis Lamm shows how the long poem “reveals that there is 
        a feminized minor within the minor literatures of American literary culture 
        struggling to find lines of escape,” a feminized minor which is never 
        fully personalized, voiced, or embodied but is “a gendered subject position 
        that exists between the seams of national, cultural, and linguistic identity.” 
        This never fully realized yet nonetheless gendered subject position in 
        Waldrop’s poetry is also at the center of Deborah Meadows’s and Linda 
        Russo’s attention. Both investigate how Waldrop’s poetic language games 
        explore the constitution and dissolution, the representation and the concealment 
        of gender. Meadows characterizes Waldrop’s method as the “Poetics of Embodied 
        Philosophy,” the poetic re-insertion or maintenance of “the corporeal 
        within philosophical systems as a position of gender strength.” Russo 
        demonstrates how the poet’s “Poetics of Inflection” combines subtle feminist, 
        grammatical, and philosophical slides “to deform traditional figures of 
        the feminine.” </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The following three papers all examine in one way 
        or another <i>how</i> Waldrop manages to create the “position in between” 
        as Lamm has called it or, in the words of Marjorie Perloff, Waldrop’s 
        “<i>between</i> world” with regard to her handling of genre and generic 
        traditions. Perloff analyzes the two books by Waldrop which would fall 
        most obviously into the category of “life-writing”: the historiographic 
        metafiction <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> and the poetic collage 
        <i>Split Infinites</i>. She demonstrates that the mimetic and epistolary 
        sequences of the novel may be closer to the author’s personal history, 
        yet only the “non-representational mode” of the poetic sequence reveals 
        the “<i>between</i> world she is trying to capture.” An autobiography, 
        or rather an autobiographical <i>roman a clef</i>, tells less than a poetic 
        “<i>auto-graph</i> which creates via linguistic density.” The technique 
        by which Waldrop effects this linguistic density is also examined by Brian 
        Reed, who inspects and compares Waldrop’s <i>A Form / Of Taking/ It All</i> 
        and <i>Shorter American Memory</i> to explore “how, when, and why Waldrop 
        adopted a collage-based aesthetic.” By situating Waldrop’s texts in the 
        traditions of North American as well as of Middle European modes of collaging, 
        Reed illuminates both the frequently overlooked international context 
        and the innovative qualities of Waldrop’s collage texts. A third take 
        on the techniques and effects of Waldrop’s idiosyncratic formal designs 
        is Susan Vanderborg’s examination of Waldrop’s “Poetics of the Book” as 
        played out in <i>A Key into the Language of America</i>. Serendipitously, 
        Vanderborg’s essay, which investigates the specific mode of collage in 
        <i>A Key</i> as “present[ing] the book form as contested space,” resonates 
        not only with Perloff’s and Reed’s theses but also with the introductory 
        conversation between Waldrop and Retallack as well as with the first analytical 
        essay by Lamm. By demonstrating the “multiple practices by which” Waldrop 
        manages to alter and recontextualize “the structure of a seemingly fixed 
        printed book,” Vanderborg’s essay suggests why Waldrop would plead for 
        readerly and, to a certain degree, even writerly openness to diverse, 
        including realist, modes of representation — all may be “necessary” at 
        some point and useful for reinterpreation and reorganization. At the same 
        time Vanderborg demonstrates on a structural level what Lamm elaborated 
        primarily on a conceptual level: that <i>A Key’s</i> poetic experiments 
        “reveal the movement of the minor from within the major’s dominance” (Lamm). 
        Instead of pretending to an easy escape from “the major,” Waldrop, states 
        Vanderborg, “makes sure that the ‘complex variables’ in her own <i>Key</i> 
        never permit an absolute or conclusive book.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Communicating with Rosmarie Waldrop — via her texts 
        or in person — is intellectually stimulating, always both an invitation 
        and a challenge. Her writing and her personality have provoked the two 
        concluding contributions by poets Bobbi Lurie and Jennifer Moxley who 
        register the excitement about, the bewitchment by, and — yes — the reverence 
        of “the magic” (Lurie) evoked by Waldrop’s poetry, of “the Waldrop Effect” 
        (Moxley). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This selection of essays and statements presents 
        diverse approaches to Rosmarie Waldrop’s linguistic experiments. Yet each 
        interpretative effort represents only one(-dimensional) commentary. An 
        ample warning can be found in Waldrop’s <i>Reluctant Gravities</i>, in 
        the section titled “On Ways of the Body”: “The price of deciphering seems 
        to be transparency.” Waldrop tells “truth [mostly] while climbing the 
        stairs.”</p>
