      <blockquote> 
        <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
          <div class=Section1> 
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Dance of Fire</i>, Lola Ridge’s last book, 
              was not intended to be part of her multi-volume <i>Lightwheel</i> 
              project, of which <i>Firehead</i> was to be the first volume. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Dance of Fire</i> begins with a sonnet sequence 
              entitled “Via Ignis.” The sequence is addressed to “Thou, multi-one,” 
              “O stringed fires,” and “O lively light”: to the dance of fire itself. 
              The deity of this fervent anarchist and feminist is disembodied, 
              or perhaps embodied in her fervency, her zeal, the religion she 
              herself has made. Ridge never rejected her vision of Jesus as a 
              martyr among thousands of contemporary labor martyrs, or of a power, 
              although not a “higher” one. The thees and thous, the verbs ending 
              in “eth,” and the stilted diction may now seem ridiculous, but the 
              archaism and spirituality expressed in these poems has a purpose: 
              it subverts both the modernism and the Marxism Ridge held in complex 
              and difficult relationship. Ridge also takes opportunities to exploit 
              some of the archaisms for effect. For example, in the first sonnet 
              of “Via Ignis,” Ridge uses “Art” instead of “Are” to yield the phrase 
              “Art all-equating.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like many Marxist poets in the 1930’s, Ridge 
              moved her poetic toward a form which sought to satisfy less-educated 
              readers’ expectations (the recognizable sonnet) but also to avoid 
              the elitism of DaDa as well as that of the Rossettis. Unlike most 
              Marxist writing, these sonnets are very abstract. Yet they are not 
              fragmented, being “worked out” in a series of correspondences. They 
              are unlike the modernist collage poems in the volume’s “Three Men 
              Die” section or in <i>Red Flag</i>. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Unlike contemporaries Lorine Niedecker or Louis 
              Zukofsky, Ridge was lauded by the literary establishment and regularly 
              published in popular journals alongside a large number of now-forgotten 
              female sonneteers, many of whom also writing on mystical topics. 
              She benefited from large grants, stays at writing colonies, and 
              plum editorships. The sonnets of “Via Ignis” show Ridge deliberately 
              participating in an individualist and political formalist lineage 
              which includes Shelley, E.A. Robinson, W.B. Yeats, and Robinson 
              Jeffers, and which might be differentiated from the political avant-garde 
              of the Commune as well as the formal avant-garde of symbolism, DaDa, 
              and later, Objectivism. &nbsp;</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As David Weir writes in his book <i>Anarchy 
              &amp; Culture</i> (which features on its cover a poem written by 
              Man Ray and Adon Lacroix during their Modern School / Kreymborg 
              period, a period contemporaneous with Ridge’s own involvement in 
              the Modern School), Shelley believed “the root or radix of politics 
              is the cultural ideal of Poetry.”(116) Ridge’s political poetry, 
              like Shelley’s, is an abstracted and idealized one addressed to 
              Culture, Poetry, Religion, one which makes the mythologizing of 
              Jeffers or Yeats seem tangible and dramatic by comparison (of course, 
              Jeffers and Yeats, also wrote plays). Ridge notably wrote no drama. 
              Like Emma Goldman, she did not believe that theatre was a way to 
              directly speak to illiterate or exhausted workers. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The abstraction of this late poetry of Ridge’s 
              makes even Shelley’s political sonnets seem concrete. Yet Ridge 
              writes very specifically in the second poem of “Via Ignis,” “Not...vassal 
              of this heart, nor...in music over heaven.” In other words, this 
              divine “dance of fire” has no feudal relationship of lord over or 
              servant to the writer; the music of the spheres is not over and 
              above anything. Rather, the divine is unlimited, beyond the limits 
              of lyre (and lyric poetry) and heart (or emotion). She continues 
              her definition through rhetorical questions such as whether what 
              is divine should be “above” humans struggling with the exigencies 
              of existence and “the void”.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A poem entitled ‘Crucible”(56) flanks “Stone 
              Face,” a political poem now being republished in many anthologies. 
              While “Stone Face” addresses Tom Mooney’s incarceration in Alcatraz, 
              “Crucible” seems to describe a parallel cultural exile by Jeffers, 
              “Away on the Carmel Coast...His, too, Point Lobos....” While Tom 
              Mooney was being held in San Francisco as Ridge entered the U.S. 
              through that city’s port, Jeffers would be, somewhat ironically, 
              at the height of his fame when <i>Dance of Fire</i> was published 
              some thirty-two years after she came to this country. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Three Men Die” makes up another section of 
              <i>Dance of Fire</i>. Nancy Berke has written extensively about 
              this poem in sections in her chapter on Ridge in her book <i>Women 
              on the Left</i>. However, it is important to discuss the ways in 
              which “Three Men Die” and another poem, “Fire Boy,” are completely 
              unlike those in the remainder of the book. Lines in the sonnets 
              of “Ice Heart” and in the alternating free verse and versification 
              of “White Buzzard” contain all of Ridge’s poetic tics and mystical 
              meanings with hardly any of the glory. As an example, the second 
              section of “Ice Heart” opens by likening the sun-based deity in 
              winter to engineers not unlike Ridge’s second husband, David Lawson, 
              who had a long undistinguished career at the water district, “...long 
              will engineers / Between the steel horizons ... / ... hold the city 
              breathing through the ice...”(86). Unfortunately, this comparison 
              disintegrates as Ridge cloyingly closes the poem with reference 
              to Caesar and Cleopatra. In “White Buzzard,” Ridge addresses death 
              with the same diction as in the sonnets, but with a different forma 
              and format in each section. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">By way of contrast, “Three Men Die” opens with 
              a stanza interrupted by a comment: </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=DOUBLESPACE>

              Looked toward the death house where the two<br>
              Lay with a thief between<br>

          </div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
          <div class=Section1> 
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Fire Boy” Ridge displays facility with 
              very long lines. Made to dance through the use of alliteration and 
              rhythm, the poem ends the book by adding “fire” to the three men 
              dead earlier, </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <blockquote>
          <div class=DOUBLESPACE>
            <div class=Section1>Let us go singing —<br>
              For what should the quick do with the dead, O four men,<br>
              seeing spring in each other’s eyes.(104)</div>
          </div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=DOUBLESPACE>
          <div class=Section1>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Until a complete edition of Ridge’s poetry 
              that includes her notes for <i>Lightwheel</i> (begun in 1929 with 
              <i>Firehead</i> and continued during a second residency at Yaddo 
              in 1930) and three of her last journals is made available, <i>Dance 
              of Fire</i> serves as the only indication of Ridge’s intended directions 
              at the time of her death. This female poet, who wrote notable long 
              poems throughout her career and who yielded to lyricism clumsily 
              at times, displays a totalizing and lyric impulse which doesn’t 
              reconcile her virtuoso political modernist collage with her eccentric 
              spiritual beliefs.</p>
