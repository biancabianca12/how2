              <div class=Section1>
                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Judging from the available critical literature 
                  on Lola Ridge, <i>Firehead </i>is probably one of Ridge’s least 
                  discussed works (my guess, though, as I’ve learned with much writing 
                  from this period, is that as soon as I write this, five or six 
                  separate studies will appear!). Even in extensive discussions 
                  of Ridge’s work, such as Nancy Berke’s <i>Women Poets on the Left, 
                  </i>there are often only one or two paragraphs devoted to the 
                  text. <i>Firehead </i>is Ridge’s second-to-last verse collection; 
                  Nancy Berke and William Drake both report that Ridge wrote this 
                  long poem during a six-week stay at Yaddo in the summer of 1929 
                  (Berke 40, Drake 199), in response to the 1927 execution of anarchists 
                  Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. The speed with which this 
                  poem was written places it in a tradition of other quickly written 
                  long poems of the period, such as Margaret Walker’s “For My People,” 
                  first published in <i>Poetry </i>in 1937, suggesting that poets 
                  felt a sense of emergency and purpose toward their work of responding 
                  to social and political injustice.  Suffice it to say, however, 
                  that <i>Firehead </i>is a particularly difficult text to talk 
                  about for a variety of reasons. Critics looking for Ridge’s most 
                  “political” work will look to earlier books, such as <i>The Ghetto 
                  and Other Poems; </i>and readers more interested in Ridge’s evolving 
                  mysticism will look to her last book, <i>Dance of Fire</i>. To 
                  a large extent, <i>Firehead</i> serves as thematic, linguistic, 
                  and contextual bridges for Ridge between these two impulses.  
                  In this more-than-200-page poem, Ridge experiments with a variety 
                  of lyric techniques.  She further investigates her feelings about 
                  mass social movements, her own commitment to anarchism, and her 
                  growing interest in communism as a social movement through her 
                  exploration of Christ’s seduction of individual apostles and of 
                  “the multitude” to carry out His work of “brotherhood.” And although 
                  this is the story of a male hero, Ridge’s vision in this poem 
                  is decidedly feminist.</p>
                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While <i>Firehead </i>is a retelling of Christ’s 
                  crucifixion and essentially a response to “perhaps the twentieth 
                  century’s worst miscarriage of justice” (Berke 53), the execution 
                  of Sacco and Vanzetti, not all critics agree on the extent to 
                  which we must read <i>Firehead </i>as either a politicized or 
                  a spiritual and emotional response. Nancy Berke claims <i>Firehead 
                  </i>“refigures Christ as our most famous victim of institutionalized 
                  murder” and that “Ridge is not concerned with Christ’s body as 
                  it is embraced and contemplated in Christian ritual. She is interested 
                  in refiguring the martyred body through its symbolic subjectivity 
                  as another politicized body in pain” (40).  I don’t believe it’s 
                  as easy to distinguish between the politicized and the ritualized 
                  body in this poem. Rather, I think Ridge wants to do both, to 
                  ritualize the politicized body or bodies of the many players in 
                  this story and to suffuse each body with its political, often 
                  feminized, often heroic value. William Drake describes <i>Firehead 
                  </i>in much more spiritual terms<i> </i>as signifying “the divine 
                  spirit in humanity, burning fiercely, destructive to complacency 
                  or to the entrenched powers that resist it. The creative spirit, 
                  in bringing into the world something new and valuable, was itself 
                  not innocent of violence” (199). Indeed, Ridge undercuts almost 
                  every biblical story with the “true” story of each of the characters’ 
                  jealousies and obsessions, which are forms of inner violence — 
                  she depicts Mary Magdalene’s long-standing jealousy of the much-loved 
                  disciple, John; Judas’s jealousy of Mary Magdalene for the pureness 
                  of her love for Jesus; even Mary’s (Christ’s mother’s) jealousy 
                  of Jesus’s followers and his passion for those followers. Ridge’s 
                  feminist convictions are revealed in her many inversions of stories 
                  she tells as well. But she does not completely secularize the 
                  event of Christ’s crucifixion. For example, Ridge’s treatment 
                  of the Holy Spirit, which remains for me one of the strangest 
                  and most difficult of Christian concepts to grasp, is visceral. 
                  The Holy Spirit becomes as idiosyncratic a character in this story 
                  as Judas or John. Ridge favors one famous biblical tale of the 
                  Holy Spirit’s power, its infiltration of the body of Peter, the 
                  apostle responsible for institutionalizing Christianity, over 
                  the story more often chosen by women writers, the insemination 
                  of Mary:</p>

              <div class=Section1> 
                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As the quote above begins to show, <i>Firehead 
                  </i>is also important to consider in terms of the hybrid nature 
                  of lyric in modernist political poetry of the period. Ridge intersperses 
                  a variety of soft and strong end rhymes with long, free verse 
                  lines, and short rhyming couplets, throughout the poem. On the 
                  Modern American Poetry website coordinated by Cary Nelson, Donna 
                  Allego describes <i>Firehead </i>as a “prose poem.” The temptation 
                  to describe it as prose has much to do with the poem’s strong 
                  narrative thread. But the poem is also filled with almost Shakespearean 
                  dramatic monologues with all of the archaic language that goes 
                  with this form, and cinematic flashbacks and theatrical hallucinations 
                  and asides that reveal the interiority of each of the characters 
                  involved in this story. The difficulty to name or to define Ridge’s 
                  range of prosodic techniques may also have to do with our own 
                  contemporary inability and discomfort with modernist political 
                  writing of the 1920s and 1930s that bridged so many genres and 
                  systems of intellectual classification. Joseph Harrington notes 
                  in <i>Poetry and the Public </i>that a “strange combination” of 
                  work that was modern and derivative “was not unusual in the 1910 
                  and 1920s as it would seem for later generations” (128). Even 
                  in Ridge’s time critics ranged in their response to her inconsistent 
                  poetics and her “antiquated diction” (as Horace Gregory and Marya 
                  Zaturenska characterized Ridge’s use of language in their entry 
                  on Ridge’s work in <i>A History of American Poetry 1900-1940). 
                  </i></p>
                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In addition to Ridge’s odd lyricism that 
                  bounces between rhyming couplets, dramatic monologues, and almost 
                  free, but cadenced Whitmanian verse (most clearly seen in the 
                  “Peter” section of the poem), I am drawn in my own most current 
                  reading of this poem to Ridge’s gendered and highly sexualized 
                  and sensualized anthropomorphic descriptions of nature and religious 
                  phenomenon, her use of high and often misplaced diction at unexpected 
                  moments, and her tirelessly extended metaphors. The poem is of 
                  great interest in terms of the history of women’s radical poetry 
                  of the period, as well, for its allegiance to what was in 1929 
                  already fast becoming an anachronistic poetess-like lyric style 
                  in the service of clearly un-lady-like material. Here is an example 
                  of a highly wrought Romantic diction in service of a bloody story:</p>

                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As Andreas Huyssen reminds us in After the 
                  Great Divide, the masses were often figured as female in modernist 
                  literature, and the repulsion of these masses was enacted by many 
                  modernist artists as repulsion of the female body. Here, Ridge&#8217;s 
                  feminized language investigates that anxiety of Christ&#8217;s 
                  association with the masses; images and words like &#8220;menopause&#8221; 
                  and &#8220;curving spine&#8221; as well as &#8220;ooze&#8221; 
                  and &#8220;pus&#8221; resonate around this depiction of Christ 
                  suffering on the cross; thus Ridge inverts this modernist anxiety 
                  and associates Christ's heroic body with the feminine body, whether 
                  that body is victimized and degraded, or triumphant. </p>
                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Ridge’s language ranges from wildly extravagant 
                  grammatical usages of words such as “The day was <i>arteried </i>with 
                  fire” (emphasis mine) (17) to graphic moments such as the nature 
                  oozing a pus we see in the quote above, emphasized by its position 
                  and rhyme with “venomous,” as well as the heightened vocabulary 
                  one might find in other high modernist poems of the era. There 
                  are cynosures (53) and diapasons (43), bantlings (155) and threnes 
                  (156).</p>
                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Whether or not a contemporary reader fights 
                  against the tide of this language or revels in it, the individual 
                  stories remain compelling. Almost all the characters describe 
                  their seduction by Jesus. And Jesus’s charisma is always associated 
                  with his anarchist spirit. John says:</p>

                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We can only know Jesus through other characters, 
                  but Ridge reveals him to be a feminist and a liberator whose philosophies 
                  always call into question the status quo:</p>
                <p>                        Jew. . . He was a man dangerous to governments, 
                  a despiser<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                           of rules, making a mockery of ordinance. . .<br>
                                                                                          
                  (203)</p>
                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Myrenne, the mother of Thaddeus, an early 
                  convert to Christianity, will say of Jesus, “he hath raped my 
                  son out of my womb!” just as she grudgingly accepts Christ’s radical 
                  views: “He did speak / Of woman as a man might of his own friends!” 
                  (165) and he “proclaimed all men were brothers” (169). Many characters 
                  share this grudging passion for Christ in Ridge’s version of the 
                  story. Even Mary, his mother, talks about Christ’s relationship 
                  to the crowd, the mass, the multitude as of more importance to 
                  him, more vitality, than whatever he could feel in intimate relationships: 
                  “Only a multitude could fan his eyes / To that deep blaze of tenderness” 
                  (134). It’s interesting to note that the story of Jesus’s life 
                  is told almost exclusively by Mary; she is the only character 
                  to whom Ridge extends this kind of narrative authority. In the 
                  final part of Mary’s section, which has been mainly in free verse, 
                  the lines break down, or perhaps break out into, a nursery rhyme 
                  rhythm, as Mary reasserts her maternal rights over Jesus’s now 
                  dead body, “swaddle him downily     hide him from sight / wash 
                  his pale hands in the milk of the light / hush his wild tongue    
                  on the strings of the sky / sounding its stammering fifth      
                  let him lie” (146). So that rather than formal verse tightening 
                  its hold on this section, the verse is used to radicalize the 
                  Christian paternal vision by returning power to the maternal figure.</p>
                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One of the final characters Ridge portrays 
                  is the artist figure, Tiro, an “image maker of Sicily / Who was 
                  slave of Saius, captain of Pilate’s guard” on his own now because 
                  Saius has become “meat for the dogs”. Tiro stands in for Ridge 
                  and her fellow artists who attempted to respond to the extended 
                  shock of Sacco and Vanzetti’s execution:</p>

                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perhaps Ridge wondered if she were too late 
                  with her image, her song. And if she could trust “the people” 
                  to respond to it. This poem is important, finally, because it 
                  expresses so well Ridge’s variety of feelings toward and confidence 
                  in mass movements. In <i>Firehead, </i>Ridge alternatively describes 
                  people pejoratively as a “crowd” or “mob” who condemned Jesus 
                  to death, or more benevolently as “the people” or “a multitude”—“The 
                  infinite murmur of the multitudes / That run out of their doors 
                  from a stone’s eaves” (59) seduced and convinced by Jesus’s philosophy. 
                  The section called “Peter” establishes the connection between 
                  the “hero” and the masses. And Peter questions whether he can 
                  maintain the relationship:</p>

                <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Nancy Berke quotes a portion of a letter 
                  Ridge wrote to her husband in 1923 that pertains well to the convictions 
                  Ridge explores in <i>Firehead</i>: “I’m not a pacifist and am 
                  an individualist and I know individuals will always rule, no matter 
                  what the society . . . even in a democracy. . . . Just now I think 
                  the communists are more fit to rule than any other group, but 
                  I tremble to think o f the result once the greater part of the 
                  world has become communist” (quoted in Berke at 53). As an anarchist, 
                  Ridge had great confidence in individual free will to guide governments 
                  and politics. But she must also have wavered in her confidence 
                  that once gathered, well-meaning individuals would make the right 
                  decisions. It was clear by 1927 that mass movements could quickly 
                  spurn mob violence, and conversely, that individuals could feel 
                  themselves inert and powerless in the face of injustice. <i>Firehead,</i> 
                  then, serves as a link between political and mystical writing 
                  for Ridge. It enables Ridge to work out some of her feelings about 
                  anarchism and communism by way of her representations of Jesus 
                  toward the “masses.” It also reveals Ridge’s commitment toward 
                  an ever-complex gendered and class vision of human liberation.
