      <P><B>editor’s notes on How2/8 -- The Fold</B></P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><B>by Ann Vickery</B></P>
      <p>something—an extract or essence of something else; this work pressed<br>
        down unfinished            overwritten            refolded</p>
      <p>                        (Rachel Blau DuPlessis, “Draft 20: Incipit,” 
        <i>Drafts 1-38, Toll</i>, 130)</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A fold suggest “something” turning on itself, bending, 
        ripples or reflexion. In the new writing section, “Textual Reflexions,” 
        contributors return to past forms, creating “something else” out of repetition.  
        In doing so, there is a focus on what is often overlooked in mechanical 
        or textual production, whether it be the labour involved, the presence 
        of the person, or the shape of the form.  But there is also a celebration 
        of the new texts that emerge, a pleasure involved in the fragment itself 
        and in the processes of overwriting, splicing and re-production.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In our other new writing section, “Southern Perils: 
        Women Experimental Poets of the South,” it is the folds of the local that 
        are accentuated.  As coordinator Camille Martin notes, these writers acknowledge 
        place as a daily, lived experience while complicating it so as to empty 
        it of its worn, nostalgic and harmful associations.  Contributors expose 
        the provisionality as well as the charge of identity and regionality.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this issue, we also feature a special section 
        on H.D. and translation.  More so than in some past issues, there is reflection 
        on the act of translation itself and the role of the translator.  Auxeméry 
        views translation as a creative act, noting: </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Translating these books by Pound and H.D. was not 
        translating in the etymological sense of “carrying something across”…It 
        was inventing paths where I was the only one who knew the twists, the 
        resonances, the echo chamber that my involvement created.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This sense of inventing rather than “carrying something 
        across” is explored at length in our two feature Readings section.  While 
        one section examines the work of little-known modernist poet, Lola Ridge, 
        the other focusses on contemporary poet, Rosmarie Waldrop, who problematizes 
        narratives of history and the act of recovery.  Kornelia Freitag opens 
        her introduction of the Waldrop feature by citing Waldrop: “The need to 
        tell is rather a need to destroy, and the need to invent a need to reconstruct, 
        differently.”  In thinking about Lola Ridge’s work, there is a need not 
        so much as to destroy as to place pressure on canonical formations in 
        writing.  There is a need to examine how the processes of forgetting are 
        gendered or class-based.  Ridge, as Catherine Daly and other contributors 
        point out, is a difficult figure for modernism in that she does not fit 
        neatly into the categories that traditionally defines it: she is both 
        a lyrical and hybrid poet; she emphasized the reality of class and poverty 
        via the abstractions of myth; she was transnational; and she was successful, 
        even populist.  While Waldrop teases out the presumptions and politics 
        of the archive, Daly suggests that we think about alternative archives—ones 
        that are less institutional, that might be able to foreground the slippery 
        nature of the texts they ‘house.’  New technologies, she continues, provide 
        us with unique opportunities to change the way in which we approach and 
        present texts from the past. 
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A roundtable on Rachel BlauDuPlessis’s recent volume, 
        <i>Drafts 1-38, Toll</i>, considers the way the present folds into the 
        past, how it is always already engaged in poetic traditions, personal 
        genealogy, and its relationship to larger historical forces.  Her work 
        mimics the textures of memory, “its unexpectedness, its flashes, its fragmentations, 
        and its erasures.” The model DuPlessis turns to be illustrate this is 
        the fold.  As she notes in the very first draft.  “connotations of impurities 
        fill the fold.”  Structurally, the second nineteen “Drafts” are donor 
        “Drafts,” referring to their counterpart in the first nineteen.  Yet, 
        there are also random echoes between the “Drafts,” creating a kind of 
        heteroglossic, impromptu dialogue.  As Harriet Tarlo suggests, “The enfolded 
        nature of the work prevents us from settling into reading the drafts <b>either</b> 
        as a seamless whole <b>or </b>as a series of discrete pieces. Instead 
        we find that we have a continual, overlapping sense of beginning again 
        and again: we are always “incipit” (the title of the twentieth draft).”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Just as this first forum is concerned with writing 
        in the face of the past, so to is the forum on “Memoire/Anti-Memoire: 
        New York City Women Writers Recall September 11, 2001.”  Borrowed from 
        a recent issue of <i>Chain</i>, the first part of the title foregrounds 
        the instability of memory, the fictions of witness.  But co-ordinator 
        Laura Hinton also views the genre of the memoire as a useful genre to 
        explore the fold between the personal and the social—particularly in terms 
        of a tragedy such as that which occurred on September 11.  This section 
        is not a sentimental revisiting/revisioning of events but rather examines 
        the capacity and limitations of writing.  Like DuPlessis, many contributors 
        examine writing as its own event.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Both the multimedia and work/book sections further 
        investigate writing in relation to lived experience.  Mendi Obadike’s 
        “keeping up appearances” investigates the invisible body and the folds 
        of discourse—recuperating the voices that are socially blanked out.  Using 
        the form of a “hypertextimonial,” her work explores new ways in which 
        one may read or see between the lines.  The writing of Eileen Myles also 
        seeks to put that which has been traditionally blanked out back into writing, 
        such as the everyday or an active female sexuality.  As Myles notes, she 
        is constantly involved in a “weird dance of absence and presence.”  Francie 
        Shaw and Bob Perelman’s “Playing Bodies” takes as its focus broadly ambiguous 
        figures of difference.  They might represent male or female, animal or 
        human, aggressor and victim, friends, or lovers.  The various positions 
        of these figures are suggestively open to interpretation, challenging 
        appearances of control, power, and passion.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">With this issue, the core production team experienced 
        some major transitions in their personal lives.  I moved back from the 
        United States to Australia.  Kate finished her PhD.  And by a strange 
        coincidence, Roberta and I both fell pregnant, Roberta only a few months 
        after I did.  These life-changes meant that we experienced some delays 
        with the issue’s release and had to rethink HOW2’s immediate future.  
        Accordingly, the next issue will be edited by Kate although I will remain 
        closely in touch with her as a contributing editor.  We have also been 
        lucky enough to have Sydney-based writer, Pam Brown, agree to be a contributing 
        editor for the next issue.  I would like to thank all the co-ordinators 
        and contributors of this issue for their patience and also to Roberta, 
        for continuing her commitment with HOW2 despite the pressures of her work 
        as Bucknell University’s webmaster and experiencing more than her fair 
        share of the less attractive side-effects of pregnancy.  Lastly, I would 
        like to thank the editorial advisory board and readers of HOW2 for their 
        ongoing support of the journal.</p>
