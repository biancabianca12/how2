      <P><strong>SPRING ISSUE: </strong>Deadline February 1, 2003<br>
        <em>BathHouse</em></P>
      <p>BathHouse, a new on-line journal of hybrid literature and literary arts 
        based at Eastern Michigan University, seeks submissions for its first 
        issue. Dedicated to promoting cross-genre and hybrid writing, BathHouse 
        values innovative and interdisciplinary writing and art in diverse forms 
        &#8212; projects that emerge out of interstices or tensions at peripheries, 
        work that arises between boundaries, beyond limits. We are looking for 
        fiction, poetry, multimedia, hypermedia, and/or audio pieces. However 
        we are particularly interested in projects that resist these categories.</p>

        themes: buried streams, sanitoriums, ancient seas, miracle cures, snake

      <P><strong>The Canadian Modernists Meet: A Symposium </strong></P>
      <P><strong>University of Ottawa, May 9-10, 2003 </strong></P>
      <P>Symposium Co-Chairs: Dean Irvine and Seymour Mayne </P>
      <P><br>
        F. R. Scott&#8217;s satirical poem &#8220;The Canadian Authors Meet&#8221; 
        has long epitomized the emergent modernist&#8217;s call for a new literary 
        movement in Canada. Seventy-five years after the publication of Scott's 
        poem in the McGill Fortnightly Review, questions about the making of literary 
        modernism in Canada are still under investigation and increasingly subject 
        to debate. </P>
      <P>This symposium seeks to bring together critics, historians, editors, 
        translators, and theorists whose research on late nineteenth-century and 
        twentieth-century literatures contributes to the study of modernism in 
        Canada. </P>

      <P><strong>2 June 2003<br>
        Sonnets of Gwendolyn Brooks</strong></P>
      <P>Essays are requested for a proposed collection on the sonnets of Gwendolyn 
        Brooks. While Brooks&#8217;s acclaimed sonnets are receiving more scholarly 
        attention, they remain largely neglected. Using new critical perspectives, 
        the essays should provide further insight into the artistry and abiding 
        resonance of Brooks&#8217;s sonnets. </P>
      <P>Interested scholars should send a 2-3 page prospectus and an updated 
        c.v. by December 1, 2002. Completed essays (MLA style) of 25-30 pages 
        from contributors will be due by June 2, 2003. </P>

        NOSTALGIA IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY BRITISH POETRY </strong><br>
        (SEAC) <br>
        Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure - Lettres et Sciences Humaines, <br>

        </a></P>
      <p>It might seem paradoxical to consider the century of the Modernist avant-garde 
        from the point of view of nostalgia. However, nostalgia manifests itself 
        in twentieth-century British poetry in a multitude of ways. A selection 
        of papers (in English) will be published in ETUDES BRITANNIQUES CONTEMPORAINES 
        after the conference. </p>
      <p>Proposals in English (200 words for a 25 minute paper) to be sent to 
        Professor Paul Volsik (at:- <a href="mailto:volsik@paris7.jussieu.fr">volsik@paris7.jussieu.fr</a>) 
        before the end of MARCH 2003. Decision on acceptance by the scientific 
        committee (SEAC) before Easter 2003. </p>
