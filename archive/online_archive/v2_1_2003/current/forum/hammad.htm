        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">1. there have been no words. i have not written one 
          word. no poetry in the ashes south of canal street. no prose in the refrigerated 
          trucks driving debris and dna. not one word.  today is a week, and seven 
          is of heavens, gods, science. evident out my kitchen window is an abstract 
          reality. sky where once was steel. smoke where once was flesh.  fire in 
          the city air and i feared for my sister’s life in a way never before. 
          and then, and now, i fear for the rest of us.  first, please god, let 
          it be a mistake, the pilot’s heart failed, the plane’s engine died. then 
          please god, let it be a nightmare, wake me now. please god, after the 
          second plane, please, don’t let it be anyone who looks like my brothers.  
          i do not know how bad a life has to break in order to kill. i have never 
          been so hungry that i willed hunger i have never been so angry as to want 
          to control a gun over a pen. not really. even as a woman, as a palestinian, 
          as a broken human being. never this broken.  more than ever, i believe 
          there is no difference. the most privileged nation, most americans do 
          not know the difference between indians, afghanis, syrians, muslims, sikhs, 
          hindus. more than ever, there is no difference.  2. thank you korea for 
          kimchi and bibim bob, and corn tea and the genteel smiles of the wait 
          staff at wonjo — smiles never revealing the heat of the food or how tired 
          they must be working long midtown shifts. thank you korea, for the belly 
          craving that brought me into the city late the night before and diverted 
          my daily train ride into the world trade center.  there are plenty of 
          thank yous in ny right now. thank you for my lazy procrastinating late 
          ass. thank you to the germs that had me call in sick. thank you, my attitude, 
          you had me fired the week before. thank you for the train that never came, 
          the rude nyer who stole my cab going downtown. thank you for the sense 
          my mama gave me to run. thank you for my legs, my eyes, my life.  3. the 
          dead are called lost and their families hold up shaky printouts in front 
          of us through screens smoked up.  we are looking for iris, mother of three. 
          please call with any information. we are searching for priti, last seen 
          on the 103rd floor. she was talking to her husband on the phone and the 
          line went. please help us find george, also known as adel. his family 
          is waiting for him with his favorite meal. i am looking for my son, who 
          was delivering coffee. i am looking for my sister girl, she started her 
          job on monday.  i am looking for peace. i am looking for mercy. i am looking 
          for evidence of compassion. any evidence of life. i am looking for life.  
          4. ricardo on the radio said in his accent thick as yuca, “i will feel 
          so much better when the first bombs drop over there. and my friends feel 
          the same way.”  on my block, a woman was crying in a car parked and stranded 
          in hurt. i offered comfort, extended a hand she did not see before she 
          said, “we’re gonna burn them so bad, i swear, so bad.” my hand went to 
          my head and my head went to the numbers within it of the dead iraqi children, 
          the dead in nicaragua. the dead in rwanda who had to vie with fake sport 
          wrestling for america’s attention.  yet when people sent emails saying, 
          this was bound to happen, lets not forget u.s. transgressions, for half 
          a second i felt resentful. hold up with that, cause i live here, these 
          are my friends and fam, and it could have been me in those buildings, 
          and we’re not bad people, do not support america’s bullying. can i just 
          have a half second to feel bad?  if i can find through this exhaust people 
          who were left behind to mourn and to resist mass murder, i might be alright.  
          thank you to the woman who saw me brinking my cool and blinking back tears. 
          she opened her arms before she asked “do you want a hug?” a big white 
          woman, and her embrace was the kind only people with the warmth of flesh 
          can offer. i wasn’t about to say no to any comfort. “my brother’s in the 
          navy,” i said. “and we’re arabs.” “wow, you got double trouble.” word. 
          5. one more person ask me if i knew the hijackers. one more motherfucker 
          ask me what navy my brother is in. one more person assume no arabs or 
          muslims were killed. one more person assume they know me, or that i represent 
          a people. or that a people represent an evil. or that evil is as simple 
          as a flag and words on a page.  we did not vilify all white men when mcveigh 
          bombed oklahoma. america did not give out his family’s addresses or where 
          he went to church. or blame the bible or pat robertson.  and when the 
          networks air footage of palestinians dancing in the street, there is no 
          apology that hungry children are bribed with sweets that turn their teeth 
          brown. that correspondents edit images. that archives are there to facilitate 
          lazy and inaccurate journalism.  and when we talk about holy books and 
          hooded men and death, why do we never mention the kkk?  if there are any 
          people on earth who understand how new york is feeling right now, they 
          are in the west bank and the gaza strip.  6. today it is ten days. last 
          night bush waged war on a man once openly funded by the cia. i do not 
          know who is responsible. read too many books, know too many people to 
          believe what i am told. i don’t give a fuck about bin laden. his vision 
          of the world does not include me or those i love. and petitions have been 
          going around for years trying to get the u.s. sponsored taliban out of 
          power. shit is complicated, and i don’t know what to think.  but i know 
          for sure who will pay.  in the world, it will be women, mostly colored 
          and poor. women will have to bury children, and support themselves through 
          grief. “either you are with us, or with the terrorists” — meaning keep 
          your people under control and your resistance censored. meaning we got 
          the loot and the nukes.  in america, it will be those amongst us who refuse 
          blanket attacks on the shivering. those of us who work toward social justice, 
          in support of civil liberties, in opposition to hateful foreign policies. 
          i have never felt less american and more new yorker —particularly brooklyn, 
          than these past days. the stars and stripes on all these cars and apartment 
          windows represent the dead as citizens first — not family members, not 
          lovers.  i feel like my skin is real thin, and that my eyes are only going 
          to get darker. the future holds little light.  my baby brother is a man 
          now, and on alert, and praying five times a day that the orders he will 
          take in a few days time are righteous and will not weigh his soul down 
          from the afterlife he deserves.  both my brothers — my heart stops when 
          i try to pray — not a beat to disturb my fear. one a rock god, the other 
          a sergeant, and both palestinian, practicing muslim, gentle men. both 
          born in brooklyn and their faces are of the archetypal arab man, all eyelashes 
          and nose and beautiful color and stubborn hair.  what will their lives 
          be like now?  over there is over here.  7. all day, across the river, 
          the smell of burning rubber and limbs floats through. the sirens have 
          stopped now. the advertisers are back on the air. the rescue workers are 
          traumatized. the skyline is brought back to human size. no longer taunting 
          the gods with its height.  i have not cried at all while writing this. 
          i cried when i saw those buildings collapse on themselves like a broken 
          heart. i have never owned pain that needs to spread like that. and i cry 
          daily that my brothers return to our mother safe and whole.  there is 
          no poetry in this. there are causes and effects. there are symbols and 
          ideologies. mad conspiracy here, and information we will never know. there 
          is death here, and there are promises of more.  there is life here. anyone 
          reading this is breathing, maybe hurting, but breathing for sure. and 
          if there is any light to come, it will shine from the eyes of those who 
          look for peace and justice after the rubble and rhetoric are cleared and 
          the phoenix has risen.  affirm life. affirm life. we got to carry each 
          other now. you are either with life, or against it.affirm life.  </p>
