            <P CLASS="TITLE2">Laura Hinton</P>
  <div class=Section1>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My piece was written during October 2001, during 
                a time of illness.  It was part of my indirect attempt to acquire 
                a language to express physical illness, to gain an interior vision 
                of the dislocations of body and mind.  This dislocation seemed to 
                me tragically mirrored in the urban atmosphere that was the aftermath 
                of the attacks upon the City of New York, where I reside, and continue 
                to work and teach. </p>
            </div>
            <blockquote> 
              <blockquote> 
                <div class=DOUBLESPACE><i>You saw nothing in Hiroshima</i>.</div>
              </blockquote>
              <div class=DOUBLESPACE>                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                — Screenplay for <i>Hiroshima Mon Amour</i></div>

            </blockquote>
            <div class=Section1> 
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like the majority of New Yorkers on the morning 
                of September 11, what I saw, or did not see, was what I viewed on 
                my TV screen. Many report that seeing those commercial jetliners 
                crash into the World Trade Center towers, then watching them fall 
                like paper fans, created an odd sense of <i>déjà vu</i>, of having 
                seen that movie before.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    It was not like a movie to me. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I saw nothing.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I rehearse again and again what I saw or 
                did not see September 11. I make words serve as placeholders for 
                the hole in what I perceived. I must have fed my crying cats that 
                morning of the 11th. I must have tried to feed myself, determined 
                to go about some physical order of the day.  I decided I should 
                eat breakfast. Blueberries in cereal would be nice. I ventured down 
                my walk-up apartment building to cross Third Avenue for the Korean 
                deli. Hit by a sudden wave of light, I was hit by another wave, 
                that of people marching up the street. People in suits with haircuts, 
                women in high heels toting briefcases. People who did not belong 
                to my no-name Manhattan neighborhood. Buy berries, I told myself, 
                trying not to stare. Lingering in the light, I became one with the 
                strangers streaming up the avenue, flowing like a river running 
                backwards, like salmon swimming upstream.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    They were the downtown survivors. Polished, 
                dressed, they brought with them the ashen black smoke that filled 
                the widening sky of lower Manhattan and the hole I could not see. 
                They came out of the belly of the smoke automaton-like, mobilized 
                in their unified stride. Silent, grim, they contrasted against the 
                backdrop of my neighborhood denizens, who perched on corners and 
                stoops, unshaven men, old women with bags, Indian restaurant owners 
                wet from having cleaned their sidewalks.   </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I entered the deli. It was bustling with 
                business. Employees struggled to fill orders for take-out sandwiches 
                — although it was not lunchtime — and coffee.  But a heavy silence 
                penetrated the air. People waited in lines all too patiently for 
                New Yorkers. A woman broke the silence, saying to no one in particular, 
                “My mother, I called my mother.” She was walking to her mother’s 
                house on 98<sup>th</sup> Street. She was wearing high heels. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    “Where are you walking from?” I asked. 
                Stupid question. I must have been thinking about blueberries. “I 
                work at the World Trade Center,” she said. I glanced at her elegant, 
                pinched pumps and I wished I could have given her my tattered loafers. 
                But I said nothing.  It was my first venture into the hole, the 
                place where I couldn’t speak. And I no longer could see her anyway, 
                because my eyes had this watery glaze coating them, smearing my 
                glasses lens.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    Blinded, gagged, I felt useless to help 
                anyone at all. Uselessness would define the rim of my hole, which 
                now was a vortex. In the hole was a powerful dark channel that had 
                swallowed up my power to activate, to create, to escape. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    My will had been metaphorically fragmented 
                into smoke. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    The next 24 hours I spent more or less 
                alone. Classes at my university were cancelled. The bridges and 
                tunnels into Manhattan were closed. My son was stuck in Brooklyn, 
                my husband stranded in Westchester. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I did receive an afternoon visit, however, 
                from a long-lost friend.  She called from Penn Station. She had 
                chosen this day to come in to Manhattan from New Jersey to buy her 
                young daughter a snowsuit. The World Trade Center collapsed and 
                she went to Macy’s to buy the snowsuit. She didn’t know what else 
                to do.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    Grateful to be helpful to someone, I said 
                to come on over. A few minutes later, sitting on my sofa, she said, 
                “What does one do on doomsday?” Indeed, what does one do?</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    We went to lunch.  </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    So while the World Trade Center blazed, 
                we sat in a local restaurant and had a sandwich. Its bar was filled 
                with the strangers in suits, their briefcases strewn haphazardly 
                around tables. People were drinking. Television screens blared everywhere. 
                Every two minutes the World Trade Center towers collapsed and incinerated 
                over and over. Television reporters tried to say something new every 
                time. They repeated themselves, just like the image. Their voices 
                would be over-ridden by the buzz of helicopters circling the air. 
                The strangers sat in small groups drinking and smoking. It was hard 
                to get a sandwich. None of the restaurant’s workers from Queens 
                and Brooklyn could come in to work, so the restaurant owner and 
                a couple of friends were trying to manage everything. They were 
                doing a lousy job. They were quickly running out of food. They charged 
                my credit card someone else’s amount. The sandwich tasted like salt 
                and sand. I couldn’t eat. Every few minutes I hopped from my table 
                and saw some piece of the World Trade Center burn again and turn 
                to dust. I saw the reruns. But I couldn’t stand still long enough 
                to really see.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    Alone again in the early evening, I wandered 
                the streets toward lower Manhattan. I went as far as police barricades 
                would permit, to 14<sup>th</sup> Street, where the cops stood like 
                tin soldiers all on alert. A few people were escorted in and out 
                of the metal barricades, wearing facemasks. Others there at the 
                barricades were snapping photographs. I couldn’t see what they were 
                trying to see through their camera lenses. There was no marked gape 
                in the skyline, for everything was darkness, everything covered 
                in a huge black pall. Then I thought I saw the outline of the World 
                Trade Center towers hovering in the air. It quickly vanished, a 
                mirage of smoke. Of course, I saw nothing. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I worked my way back through Madison Park, 
                where the street people were rolled up in their tattered blankets. 
                There were other people, as well, a crying woman here and there, 
                sitting alone in the descending dark on a park bench, wearing tennis 
                shoes and nylon hose, perhaps a leather bag propped against her. 
                These were the new “homeless.” Perhaps they couldn’t get over the 
                bridge to husbands in New Jersey, perhaps they had lost someone 
                downtown and were searching for him, for her. Really, who were they? 
                Their heads in their hands, they looked unattached to the landscape. 
                Women in nylon hose don’t sit in parks alone, at night, in New York 
                City.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I turned again to see what I wanted to 
                see — the outline of the World Trade Center. The black pall now 
                blended without distinction into the black of the night sky. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I wandered from Madison Park to Gramercy 
                Park, through one of its wrought-iron gates usually closed to outsiders. 
                Tonight, exclusive, lush Gramercy was an open oasis. Inside, students 
                were holding a candlelight vigil. They were singing “Amazing Grace.” 
                I joined them on a chorus of what I would later e-mail my friends 
                was “Amazing Grave.” I had absorbed Major Guiliani’s unintended 
                pun from morning television news broadcasts, describing unknown 
                but “grave” casualties. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I had seen the smoke. I knew those people 
                had vaporized.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    In the days that would pass, I did not 
                watch TV. I could not watch the towering crematoriums burn and smoke, 
                spin and turn to ash.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    But I did read the newspapers in search 
                of information. I wanted questions articulated for which politicians 
                had already made easy answers. Experts on Islam came out the back 
                alleys of university corridors and wrote eloquent columns on the 
                page. Yet I was combing for another sort of information. I was looking 
                for mention of exactly who those people were at the World Trade 
                Center on September 11. I was looking for some understanding of 
                how to interpret so sudden an arrested fate.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I reconstructed stories and put them into 
                my hole. This act was futile. The hole had swept through them. It 
                was growing wider. Stories require a beginning, a middle and an 
                end. We had the beginnings, we had portions of middles. But we had 
                no ends. No closure. Many have no identities. Those engulfed by 
                the World Trade Center are still called the “Missing.” As of now, 
                most have not been legally declared dead.  Relatives wait, hoping 
                for better news.  There are shadows but few bodies. No closure is 
                in sight. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    Without bodies, we cling to fragments. 
                I cling to the fragments of stories I read, for example, in the 
                <i>New York Times</i>. There, a daily page, euphemistically entitled, 
                “Portraits of Grief,” provides short eulogies about the World Trade 
                Center’s “Missing.” This page might better be called, “Fragments 
                about the Dead.” It is part of a new <i>Times</i> section published 
                for the occasion of terrorism and war, which, too, bears a euphemism: 
                “A Nation Challenged.” This title might also be more aptly rephrased. 
                I would call it, “A Nation Filled with Anguish and Horror,” or, 
                “The Nation of Paranoia” section. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I open up today’s <i>Times</i>. One “portrait” 
                is about a young Yugoslavian immigrant who had fallen in love with 
                New York City.  He recently had matriculated at Baruch College, 
                one of the colleges constituting the City University of New York. 
                I teach at another CUNY campus. This young Yugoslavian could have 
                been one of my students. He could have been my neighbor. I teach 
                uptown, but I live near Baruch. I could have seen him at the xerox 
                store on Third Avenue, where the students duplicate textbooks at 
                registration. I could have bumped into him at the checkout stand 
                at Duane Reade Drugstore. I could have passed him <i>en route</i> 
                to the subway as he kissed his girlfriend on the corner of Lexington 
                and 26<sup>th</sup>. According to the girlfriend, “He loved everything” 
                about New York. Apparently, he loved her, too. She is inconsolable.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    Then there is the junior high-school sweetheart 
                who did not propose to his wife until they both had turned 26.  
                When they finally married, the formerly wild party-boy and drifter 
                settled down to a nice steady life as a bonds trader, at Cantor 
                Fitzgerald, in the World Trade Center.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    There is the young father that my stepson 
                knew, another Cantor Fitzgerald employee. He would show photos around 
                of his baby girl when coming in on his New Jersey train. His wife 
                was quoted as saying, “He was enamored of fatherhood.” He wanted 
                nothing more than to be at home with his new daughter.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    There was the fireman who also loved to 
                paint. There was the police officer who spoke four languages and 
                worked part-time as a translator. There was a butcher, a baker, 
                a candlestick maker. There was a security guard who would feed the 
                homeless every week at his Seventh Day Adventist Church.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    These are the Missing, whose lives we try 
                to narrate, as we excavate them, piecemeal, from newspaper accounts. 
                We see their smiling faces everywhere on posters around town. These 
                paper fliers, announcing they are “Missing,” are tacked to walls, 
                to store fronts, to light posts, to telephone booths — the sexy 
                glances of the “Missing” catch my eye as I pass the New York Armory 
                at Lexington.  The Armory was made an official “Crisis Center” in 
                the first days after September 11. Two blocks from my apartment, 
                it was the place to which family members were asked to bring toothbrushes 
                and hairbrushes, along with descriptions of their “Missing.” Innovative 
                family members brought fliers, too, then vied for the media cameras 
                and sensational spotlights that flooded street corners around Lexington 
                for days. They thrust their “Missing’s” smiling photograph into 
                the media’s face. They did not smile themselves.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    Along the brick wall of the Armory, the 
                fliers begin to shred and peel.  The family members and the media 
                are long gone. But the “Missing” fliers remain, a shrill call for 
                help. “Anyone know Diane?” Or, “Call if you have information about 
                William.” “Diane,” we learn, was born in upstate New York in 1964. 
                She would have been 38 years old when she joined the Missing. A 
                handsome man of 28, William, we learn, is a father of two, who worked 
                as an accountant on the north tower’s 92<sup>nd</sup> floor. Call 
                his wife if you have any information, his flier pleads. Information?  
                I have none. Increasingly whipped by fall winds, some of the letters 
                in “Missing”disintegrate, losing an “h” or an “n.” The faces of 
                the “Missing,” however, steadfastly smile on.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    The hole where the World Trade Center stood 
                is hallowed ground. They are talking about making what was once 
                the World Trade Center a memorial site.  But, of course, they also 
                want to rebuild Manhattan’s prime office space; they want to rekindle 
                the economic energy of a dying downtown. Politicians speak out of 
                two sides of their mouth, as the fragments of the World Trade Center 
                are moved in truckloads to a Staten Island city dump site. There, 
                on Staten Island, they sift for pieces of identifiable objects. 
                Retired police detectives and other volunteers pass gloved hands 
                tenderly through rubble moving along a conveyor belt. They feel 
                for fragments of a leather shoe or golden ring. On a good day, they 
                find a warped police badge or a credit card whose numbers are intact. 
              </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    This is the Amazing Grave of Staten Island, 
                where they also find pieces of bone welded to fragments of fabric 
                and steel. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><strong>  Coda </strong> 
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    It is the evening of October 11, 2001.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    Tonight, for the first time, I went down 
                to the World Trade Center. To where the World Trade Center once 
                stood.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I went not as a tourist, and not to gawk.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I went to honor the dead who were my neighbors. 
              </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I went to Fulton Street and Broadway, where, 
                over the grid-like barriers, the still-standing high rises are masked 
                with huge protective canvas nets like veils of mourning, and where 
                “rescue workers,” who are really rubble diggers, make their way 
                further into a hole I cannot glimpse from Fulton and Broadway, whose 
                cavernous place I can only imagine. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    I see the blown-out bits of what must have 
                been World Trade Center 7.  Beyond, I see a hulk of steel that I 
                recognize from newspaper photographs, the remnants of one of the 
                towers.  It does not look like a tower at all. It looks like giant 
                shark teeth propped against a faded sun.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    The light becomes, for an instant, falsely 
                luminous, and the twisted gauntlet of steel turns purple, then is 
                shot by rays of pink. Red lights flow on the surface of the Hudson, 
                which one now sees from Fulton and Broadway. Then, red flecks reach 
                the shark’s teeth, more surreal than real.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    More nightmarish than dreamlike. </p>
              
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">    To face the vanishing lights, the traces, of 
            the World Trade Center, I confront the hole I cannot see. The sun dips 
            its belly into the fullness of the new horizon. There are dark eddies 
            and swells and pools. Then the Hudson deepens and becomes part of the 
            sea.</p>
