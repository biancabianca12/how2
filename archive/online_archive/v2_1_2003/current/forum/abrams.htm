        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><em>September 11 started for my lover and me as a 
          videotape of the first plane on our bedroom TV.. We were among the lucky 
          New Yorkers.  Half-crazed, I ran outside to the sickening evidence of 
          a smoky shaft in the sky downtown.  In the two minutes I stood there, 
          they hit the other tower, which I found out back inside.  I was not one 
          of those writers who contemplated whether you can write about a tragedy 
          as it is happening.  I was devastated and furious, and I still am. Sitting 
          in front of the TV, I started taking down facts that seemed important, 
          and I kept this up for three months. I edited what I had, and it became 
          a poem.  </em></p>
        <P >Living in New York, you think you’ve seen everything.   </p>
        <p>Not that 14th Street, your street, had seemed a likely frontier.  You 
          knew <i>global warming</i> was going to flood Manhattan, making all downtown 
          a shipwreck.<i>  Some day</i>.  But this?</p>
        <p>And not that if you’d been that guy in the subway in Washington, D.C., 
          and everyone’s cell phone started ringing, you’d have known what was going 
          on either. </p>
        <p>Not that a manual on flying a commercial jet is the same as flying it. 
          Not that Venice, Florida, with its shitty rental cars, should be confused 
          with Venice, Italy.  </p>
        <p>Not that the Mayor’s emergency bunker under #7 WTC was such a good place 
          to hide.  Not that you cared to make further criticism of that government 
          idea or any other at the moment.  Though why someone would form a motorcade 
          to a secret location, unless it’s a decoy, is a mystery.  Not that <i>decoy</i> 
          had been a staple of your vocabulary...except as referring to duck hunting, 
          which you’re against. </p>
        <p>Not that your young mother, working at the Pentagon, had expected the 
          highest clearance.  Or to know about Pearl Harbor hours before she could 
          tell.  Not that everyone wants to hear immediately about tragedies.</p>
        <p>Not that a drill is the real thing.  Not that the real thing is readily 
          recognizable. </p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Not that it wasn’t bad timing that your lover’s father had been moved 
          from Florida — by the two of you — to the Bronx the day before.</p>
        <p>And not that it wasn’t puzzling to have paid September rent plus deposit, 
          3900 each, to install him in <u>assisted living</u>, only to be asked 
          to move him out.  Not that people with Parkinson’s can always help drooling.</p>
        <p>Not that you’d have planned your last communal experience before it happened, 
          to be at Ikea buying him furniture.</p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Not that you were offended at first by<i> Attack on America</i>.  The 
          same tag line for every program you could get on TV.  Meaning cable and 
          only CBS of the broadcast channels, since they hadn’t ever taken down 
          the old antenna.  On the Empire State Building, from when <u>it</u> was 
          the highest point in New York.  </p>
        <p>Not that you’d ever paid attention to the Woolworths Building, featured 
          in the first hour of coverage, and certainly not to its height, dwarfed 
          at the tip of Manhattan.  Frankly, you were concerned about the ground 
          level Woolworths, disappearing like black holes that sucked down into 
          them all the little tools and objects of the universe.  Not that you remember 
          half of what those were now.</p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Not that you hadn’t complained about your lover’s 45-minute showers.  
          Not that you’d have been with her that morning otherwise.  Where would 
          you have been?  On the map of uncanny places...not where assassinations 
          take place, for example, but where people were when they heard.  Empire 
          of a single tourist.  </p>
        <p>Make a dot for Disney World, with the imposter Goofy and the imposter 
          Donald Duck, in Orlando, Florida.  (Pencil in the whole damn state: #1 
          in carjackings, #52 in health care.) You hadn’t intended to feel sad when 
          they closed it. </p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Not  that you thought canceling an election — even a local primary — 
          was a good thing.  </p>
        <p>Though not that the last election — for President — topped your list 
          of outrages now.  </p>
        <p>Who ever thought they’d wonder where Air Force One was? </p>
        <p>Or in their lifetime visit www.fbi.org?  Defend the stock market’s right 
          to exist? </p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>The Japanese proverb that didn’t apply: <i>Fall down seven times, stand 
          up eight.</i><u></u></p>
        <p>What wasn’t the marathon: a horde of people crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.  
        </p>
        <p>Not that everyone was Caucasian and not that everyone was old, who escaped 
          hair to shoes frosted white. </p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Imponderables: the one who had cramps and drank the vodka, the one on 
          vacation, the one who told the boss<i> go fuck yourself</i> and quit.  
          The one who had to have the bagel.  The one who was always late.  The 
          one who voted come hell or high water...twice.  The one whose dog wouldn’t 
          pee.  The mother who time-shared.  The screenwriter so broke she took 
          the bus.  The one who in the eighties became a coke-head and never worked 
          again.  The one who had a terminal illness anyway.  The chef of Windows 
          on the World, floor 110, who veered off for eyeglasses.  All that food 
          pureed.</p>
        <p>And the destiny of paper: reams prematurely to the shredder, all documents 
          in the <i>Disaster </i>file.  Passports and drivers licenses unnecessary 
          for impromptu free fall. <i>Wish you were here</i> crossed out.<u></u></p>
        <p>Written in disappearing ink: a window washer.</p>
        <p>Floor 25, BlueCross BlueShield.  Forget your catastrophic coverage.</p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Not that they <u>let stand</u> the remark that it happened in New York 
          because of all the abortionists, feminists, lesbians and the ACLU.  Not 
          that you’d thought of yourself as controlling world politics.  </p>
        <p>Not that they <u>let stand</u> the e-mail sent to seventeen thousand 
          people on the Left Media List:  <i>I am pleased to report that it is NOT 
          TRUE that 4,000 Israelis did not show up for work at the World Trade Center 
          on Sept. 11.  Please forgive my mistake!  Love and Peace and Blessings, 
          </i>name withheld in poem to avoid lawsuit.  </p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>In a flash poll, 61% of Americans favored waging war.  62% weren’t sure 
          on whom.  Your lover said, <i>Between evil people and idiots, we’ve had 
          it.</i></p>
        <p>Children are the only logicians: </p>
        <p>The girl who said, <i>So if they didn’t like New York, why couldn’t they 
          just ignore New York</i><u>?</u></p>
        <p>The boy who when told there were people missing asked, <i>Are their mothers 
          looking for them</i>?</p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Driving back to the City, three days later, from an emergency trip to 
          your own mother in Boston, you were mildly surprised to pass a check point.  
          Not that you expected warships in New York Harbor, where your ostentatious 
          friend had rented a boat for the Bicentennial.  Everyone got seasick from 
          the wake of so many pleasure crafts and threw up their fancy dinners.  
          It was 1976, the last time you saw so many flags.</p>
        <p>The Javitz Center reminded you of Woodstock.  Minus the music, admittedly.  
          All right.  Plus the National Guard.  But there were the reserves of food 
          stacked to the spirit of communal destiny and the unilateral high hopes 
          of youth.  Still, those helicopters weren’t about to download ten cases 
          of artichoke hearts from the now defunct Concorde Hotel in the Catskills.  
          An acid head’s feast.  You saw two girls in chadors and tight pants riding 
          a sawhorse from a barricade, being cruised by two Hasidic boys trying 
          to outrace their coats.  A pair of debutantes accepting free Cokes from 
          their ghetto counterparts, who magnanimously threw in a straw each.  Everything 
          comes in twos, apparently.</p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>The Twins as celebrities.  The most recent subjects of the serial neighborhood 
          murals: RIP Lady Di, Mother Theresa, JFK Jr., Selena the pop star shot 
          dead, and Lisa shaken by her crack head step-father.  Or was it Marta?  
          Well, anyway, one of those girls.  Like Greek tragedy, no joke.  </p>
        <p>Union Square was the opposite of a rogues’ gallery:  Thank God for scotch 
          tape and color xerox and digital photography, for part-time actors’ head 
          shots and yearbooks.  The ugly rejected passport photos, the wedding albums 
          of the divorced.  Authors’ book  jackets, expired IDs, last year’s Christmas 
          cards, the calendar from Fotomat, the Polaroids.  Thank God for all flat 
          surfaces.  Before it was understood that, like the flight crews, no one 
          would be found: Hung from a wall, a king size bed sheet with the names 
          in Magic Marker of the permanently sleeping, captioned: <i>American Proud 
          and Tall.  United Through it All</i>.  And underfoot, <i>Ode to a Flight 
          Attendant</i> on cardboards taped haphazardly to the sidewalk.  A kite 
          tail too heavy for the kite.  Grief is like a dream in which all wishes 
          of the dead are granted.  A mother now writes of her daughter, <i>distinguishing 
          features: tongue ring, fish tattoo</i>.<u></u></p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________<u></u></p>
        <p>Your <u>own </u>mother can’t remember if she’s taken her pills or where 
          she lost either plate of her dentures.  Both pairs.  But she remembered 
          where her hairdresser was.  She cleaned out her bank account, not to pay 
          him or contribute to the $2000 replacement teeth but to hand over a month’s 
          Social Security for a cruise that she was offered over the phone for free. 
          Not that that could be attributed solely to dementia. How could it be 
          free? my brother yelled at her, if you gave them $1200? <u></u></p>
        <p>Korsakoff’s Syndrome sounded like something romantic but it was just 
          short-term memory loss from alcoholism.</p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Not that you could call all the makeshift morgues ghost towns exactly...since 
          no one had ever lived there.</p>
        <p>And not that those towers were our redwoods if you’re being literal.</p>
        <p>Not that a human chain is the best metaphor for a policeman leading a 
          whole floor of people by hand down 95 flights of a pitch black stairwell, 
          albeit with a better than average flashlight.  Maybe picture DNA, so unfathomable 
          as to be beautiful.  Or something ordinary but almost crazy, like a conga 
          line.  No one was the weakest link.</p>
        <p>Not that one woman who wore a placemat over her face to breathe, actually 
          thought it was Afghanistan.  Though try running when you’re wearing a 
          whole tablecloth.</p>
        <p>And not that the Taliban — who blew up the two largest Buddhas in the 
          world — merited special consideration anyway.  Unless everyone deserves 
          a second chance?  Fair enough. Pick a number between one and 110.  </p>
        <p>So if we’ve had the disappeared and the homeless, is it now <i>the pulverized</i>? 
          The minced-meat? Previous to this you associated body parts with serial 
          killers, one problem New York doesn’t have.  Not that you could have imagined 
          in your wildest dreams your lover saying, <i>It’s the bodies</i> after 
          you commented that the workers were cooking again in the basement below 
          your window.  The wind had shifted. OK, so you’re not a pacifist any more.</p>
        <p>42, 000 windows.  16 acres.  5,843 dead or missing a week later. The 
          devil is in the details.</p>

        <p>Desired job: rescue worker</p>

        <p>Capable of heroic measures.</p>
        <p>Interview: <i>Myself and EMT Ramos have been part of a trained force.  
          We’ve been treated with oxygen.  We follow orders.  </i>Did you see any 
          deaths?  <i>I witnessed a disaster beyond my wildest </i></p>
        <p><i>dreams, ma’am.</i></p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Your friend, older than your mother, who climbed down 43 flights of stairs</p>
        <p>and was finally being elevated back up was asked by a TV reporter,</p>
        <p>if she’d known at the time that everything in her apartment was going 
          to be destroyed</p>
        <p>what was the one thing she’d have wanted to save? </p>
        <p><i>The view</i>, your friend said.</p>
        <p>Further evidence of ruin: the name <i>Mohammed Islam</i> on a hack license.</p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>Can the personal be tragic? </p>
        <p>Is one the loneliest number?</p>
        <p>Not that fitting your mother with a diaper that weekend was as bad as 
          the devastation at home.  But not that a part of you — and her — didn’t 
          wish she’d been blown to smithereens too. Not that she would remember 
          thinking that. </p>
        <p>In the Bronx your father-in-law (in a better world) was the same irritating 
          man.  Falling out of his wheelchair trying to pick up a paperclip...hording 
          electrical cords without plugs...using batteries with just enough charge 
          to ruin music.  He sprays the cans of whipped cream directly into his 
          mouth.  </p>
        <p>Not that the movers, meanwhile, driving via New Jersey, had planned to 
          run their truck into the George Washington Bridge.  Clearly, ripping a 
          hole in your own roof is not a terrorist act.</p>
        <p>So three of the terrorists turned out to be from Delray Beach, Florida, 
          where you spent September 8-10 packing up one old man’s paltry and final 
          treasures.  The same place where later they found the first Anthrax.  
          If you think life isn’t a mystery, ponder that.  </p>
        <p>Or the randomness of sweethearts:</p>
        <p>someone clasping the nearest hand to jump with that person off a roof</p>
        <p>a man on a cell phone connecting to 911 and his soulmate operator from 
          an airplane.</p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>One rumor was the shower of gold rising from bullion reserves buried 
          under the buildings.  Survivors saw this as a miracle.  For them it was.</p>
        <p>And the rest hardly more credible.  The special dogs scrambling over 
          the smoking rubble, who when being bathed and rehydrated strained to return?  
          How they could identify the traumatized workers — though maybe that was 
          everyone — wasn’t explained.  But their paws became so sore and inflamed 
          that Patagonia donated little pads.  Where<i> is</i> that again? I asked 
          my lover, who was reading aloud the paper.  <i>The company</i>, she clarified.  
          They donated <i>gortex pads</i>.  Forgive me for thinking Shangri-la. 
        </p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>The new grammar:</p>
        <p>A flight attendant is not a stewardess</p>
        <p>A fire is not a paring knife to remove a person’s skin just so.</p>
        <p>An airplane is not a yo-yo.  It can go down but that’s the end of <i>up.</i></p>
        <p>A subway is not a chute to hell. It’s hell.</p>
        <p>A gap in the skyline is not an amputation.</p>
        <p>An amputation is nevertheless not by custom performed with an airplane. 
        </p>
        <p><i>Disaster Zone</i> is not a good sign for your nephew’s bedroom door 
          now.</p>
        <p>People can’t say, and mean, that they were lucky to have survived high 
          school.</p>
        <p>Honestly, analysis never prepared you for this.</p>
        <p>Other things you never expected </p>
        <p>but secretly may have hoped for:</p>
        <p>The Queen of England to sing the <i>Star-spangled Banner.</i></p>
        <p>Elizabeth Taylor to slip into the Armory on Park Avenue to visit the 
          families.</p>
        <p>The Gurkhas to be sent on assignment in Afghanistan. How often have you 
          heard <i>whatever happened to the Gurkhas</i>? Not often enough. </p>
        <p>The high school marching band from Huntsville, Alabama, that played, 
          standing stock still, at the site.  The psychic in Brighton Beach who 
          came out of retirement to help find the living then stayed to contact 
          the dead.  The mother and son who drove straight through with crawfish 
          from Louisiana.  The Oregon tourists who refused to cancel.</p>
        <p align=center style='text-align:center'>________</p>
        <p>So what if Kate Smith commissioned <i>God Bless America</i> to have a 
          hit.</p>
        <p>So what — you half mean this — if the Yankees lose the World Series.  
        </p>
        <p>And so what if your cell phone won’t work from the subway never mind 
          a 747.</p>
        <p>It’s become a cliché: <i>location, location, location</i>.  And yet</p>
        <p>Suddenly nothing else matters.</p>
        <p>How could all that happened</p>
        <p>Have fit into one week for one reason in one city? </p>
        <p>Because this is New York.  </p>
        <p>Where else would the 21st century have begun?</p>
