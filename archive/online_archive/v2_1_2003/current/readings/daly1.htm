      <blockquote> 
        <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like many not-quite-academics, one of my current 
            projects is scanning works of poetry which are in the public domain, 
            writing about these works, and locating people with server space online 
            who might host these books. In addition to Project Gutenberg, which 
            makes texts available as unformatted.txt files, Marxists.org, Al Filreis’ 
            English 88 site, and John Mark Ockerbloom’s Online Books Site at University 
            of Pennsylvania, which contains Mary Mark’s Celebration of Women Writers 
            site, host books in their entirety.   Mary Mark’s Celebration of Women 
            Writers site now hosts Genevieve Taggard’s first book, <i>For Eager 
            Lovers</i>, which was published in 1922, and which is in the public 
            domain (as are all books published before but importantly, not including, 
            1923).  </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I collect books I find in pre-1923 editions.  
            I will eventually scan all of these books, but I am most interested 
            in scanning the works of female modernist poets.  The vast majority 
            of public domain texts now online are pre-1922 “classics” and translations 
            of “classics.”  There are very few works by women available <i>at 
            all</i>.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Since I began this project, I’ve learned some 
            practical information about copyrights and online publishing that 
            everyone working with poetry written in the earlier portion of the 
            twentieth century and published in the United States should know.   
            Copyright for materials of this era can’t be researched online:  the 
            U.S. Copyright office only offers online searches for materials published 
            after 1978, which is a bit silly.  Those materials will be under copyright 
            protection for quite some time.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When works are reprinted, they are re-copyrighted.  
            This is important to note since many small presses and academic presses 
            fill their lists and anthologies with reprints of public domain materials, 
            since there is no reprint or permissions cost.  For example, one of 
            the books I will be scanning is William Carlos William’s <i>Kora in 
            Hell.  </i>Most experimental poets know it from the City Lights edition; 
            I was lucky enough to locate the 1920 edition with a lovely, uncharacteristic 
            etching by Stuart Davis.  While in most cases only the apparatus and 
            new introduction (there is generally one) in a reprint is under a 
            new copyright, it is not possible to prove that no emendation or other 
            editing was performed on the original text (and hence protected by 
            copyright) without reference to the original text.  In other words, 
            as far as free use of public domain materials is concerned, the City 
            Lights version of <i>Kora in Hell </i>is useless.  </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Savvier literary executors will republish public 
            domain materials under their stewardship in a slightly edited form 
            and with new front matter for a different reason:  many libraries 
            will not allow access to frangible holdings in the public domain if 
            a more recent version is available.  This republication can prevent 
            anyone from using the work without obtaining permission.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I did not scan and upload Genevieve Taggard’s 
            1923 <i>Hawaiian Hilltop</i>, as it was not published <i>before </i>1923:  
            it is not definitely in the public domain.  In fact, I didn’t bother 
            to research the copyright and see if it was renewed or not.  Copyright 
            for materials published between 1923 and 1964, like <i>Hawaiian Hilltop</i>, 
            had to be renewed at twenty-eight year intervals.  The copyright on 
            <i>Hawaiian Hilltop</i> would have had to have been renewed anywhere 
            from 1950-1952 (there’s a window of time for renewal).  It would be 
            worth checking renewal on this work in particular, because this is 
            not a full-length book, and because its copyright came up for renewal 
            immediately after Taggard’s death.  It is the sort of thing that might 
            have been easily overlooked by a new literary executor dealing with 
            a blacklisted author’s estate during the McCarthy period.  For example, 
            the copyright on Lola Ridge’s <i>Red Flag, </i>while published in 
            1925, was not renewed:  it is in the public domain.  </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In order to research <i>Red Flag</i>, I went 
            to the Los Angeles Public Library, which, as all decent libraries 
            do, has shelves and shelves of the print volumes of the <i>Catalog 
            of Copyright Entries. </i> For researching <i>Hawaiian Hilltop, </i>I 
            would examine the 1950, 1951, and 1952 volumes for the renewal, photocopying 
            the pages of all places the renewal could have been listed, looking 
            for renewals by anyone who might be a publisher or an executor as 
            well as every possible permutation of the author’s name.  For example, 
            even in the case when a female author continued to publish under her 
            maiden name after marriage, as did Taggard, copyrights are often renewed 
            under her married name, especially when the executor is a relative.  
          </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">However, even if you do not find a renewal, you 
            are in the business of proving a negative:  you are saying the renewal 
            does not exist.  The material is in the public domain, but most academic 
            journals, and academically sponsored servers and initiatives, etc., 
            will not take the small risk of having to show in court that there 
            is no renewal.  Many literary executors will threaten a lawsuit as 
            a matter of course, whether or not they have a case.  This sounds 
            much more frightening than it is; what are they going to do in court, 
            show that copyright has been renewed?   If you yourself are willing 
            to take this small risk, and own a server, you may make the text available 
            online.   Some academic presses, especially in the case of copyrights 
            that no one thought to renew on novels that might make good movies, 
            pay and otherwise recognize (generally in their print editions) people 
            or other small presses who do not hold the copyright as copyright 
            holders in order to avoid the risk of litigation.  </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Copyright is a property right:  it may be transferred 
            in specific writing, and it may be willed and inherited along with 
            other property in an estate.  While some authors appoint qualified 
            literary executors, and those executors appoint people to take their 
            place as they age, more authors allow control of the work to pass 
            to their heirs, or allow relatives who are not writers or lawyers 
            to act as literary executors.  While some of the archives of materials 
            writers collect are quite valuable, and academic institutions pay 
            millions of dollars to obtain them, more archives have a minimal value, 
            and that only to academics.  It is uncommon for anthologists to pay 
            as much as the Eliot estate, for example, demands to reprint a poem.  
            Ironically, the descendants of Communist Party faithful who wrote 
            minor verse in approved styles are most determined that their inherited 
            property be full of value.  </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In order to quote, upload, or otherwise “do criticism” 
            or make “derivative works” based on literature published in the 20s 
            and 30s but not in the public domain without having to negotiate what 
            fair use of the materials is, you can generally locate excerpts or 
            individual poems in periodicals and anthologies published before 1923, 
            and use those versions.  This is particularly the case for the female 
            modernist poets of my interest.  They often published one slim volume 
            after a career of periodical publishing.  When you cannot locate the 
            materials you need in public domain editions, you must rely on the 
            vagaries of fair use.  </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The two most obvious attempts to use fair use 
            guidelines to make materials under copyright protection available 
            were Napster and, in the poetry world, Red Frog:  Poems from the Planet 
            Earth.  The initial idea in both was that if each person uploaded 
            to server space on the internet what she was allowed to upload under 
            fair use, and the results were pooled, entire works would be available 
            free.  In the case of Red Frog:  Poems from the Planet Earth, individuals 
            were encouraged to type 250 word or less short poems which were not 
            in the public domain into a submission form, no more than one poem 
            a day.  These were then indexed by author.  The server itself was 
            located in Poland, adding an extra level of protection to the copyright 
            violators, the owners of the servers.  While it was a commonplace 
            for the more determined estates, such as those of E. E. Cummings, 
            to police personal web pages and force the removal of poems, as of 
            this writing, I was able to locate about 70 of Cummings’ poems online 
            at the time of this writing by using a cursory web search.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There are some problems with fair use.  It is 
            vague.  While any work of criticism discussing the materials or any 
            reuse in an artwork is fair use, it is generally not considered to 
            be fair use by uninformed literary executors, who would like to consider 
            criticism or “sourced” artworks to be “derivative works” not allowed 
            under fair use or “libelous”.  Fair use is nearly impossible to protect 
            or enforce.  In general, most large research institutions prohibit 
            exercise of fair use for copyrighted materials.  The letter of the 
            law, as at the Cornell Legal Information Institute site, is:</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote>
          Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 
            and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by 
            reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified 
            by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, 
            teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, 
            or research, is not an infringement of copyright.</div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=DOUBLESPACE>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The problem with fair use is that most every 
            use of copyrighted materials is fair use.  Why on earth would one 
            want to quote or print some or many poems, letters, or even photographs 
            of obscured writers except for purposes of criticism, comment, teaching, 
            scholarship, or research?  </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">However, many institutions are concerned with 
            other sections of the law, in which, for example, a library, archive, 
            or institution may not allow copies to be made if the person receiving 
            the copies may profit from use of the materials, or if the copyright 
            holder is attempting to profit from the use of the materials.  The 
            consideration of “profit” together with poetry and academic writing 
            has always seemed particularly laughable to me.  It is not always 
            that the literary executor has a fantasy of making a movie a la <i>Reds 
            </i>out of her mother’s old fellow-traveler ballads.  There are ways 
            that a critic profits from writing and publishing a paper on a forgotten 
            poet.  There might be a ridiculously small payment from a literary 
            journal, or at least a free copy or two.  It’s a resume builder: it 
            might help the critic get a job.  </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The estate might perceive negative reviews, or 
            any reviews, as defamatory or libelous.  It can be difficult to distinguish 
            between art made from the copyrighted material and “derivative works.”  
            Libel laws, like the estate, inheritance, and property laws, are not 
            federal laws.  They vary from state to state in the U.S.  They vary 
            according to where the item was published, and if the author was a 
            citizen or not.  The strongest case for libel in this arena is one 
            of financial injury.  A case for financial injury might involve a 
            copyright holder unable to reprint a work because it was reviewed 
            unfavorably, or because the only “interesting” parts of it were printed.  
            In the case of blacklisted writers, some relatives acting as executors 
            believe that even mentioning political activities which are matters 
            of public record would cast their forebear in an unflattering light.  
          </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Those who would like a better understanding of 
            American poetry in the early twentieth century are quickly amazed 
            at the number of books and poems in periodicals written by women, 
            women whose works are not available to anyone outside a major university 
            or a major metropolitan area, women who have been completely forgotten.  
            Those who work with print materials in an academic setting are frequently 
            surprised that their use of print matter, which seems so clearly to 
            fall under the guidelines of fair use, becomes embroiled in considerations 
            of copyright.  In the United States, where being “safely dead” does 
            not end copyright, those determined to write with reference to past 
            writing without interference learn about copyright laws.  </p>
