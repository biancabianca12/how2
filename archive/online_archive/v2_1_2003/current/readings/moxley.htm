        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Steve and I had been living in Providence for about 
            seven months when we were requested to present ourselves at five o’clock 
            sharp at the door of that renowned address, 71 Elmgrove, for <i>drinks</i>. 
            As we knew our destination to be but a five-minute walk we at first 
            thought to set out on foot, but it was mid-January and the weather was 
            raw and so we decided to take the car. Past the nineteen-fifties era 
            shops lining Wayland Square we drove, until we came upon the long, straight, 
            and peaceful Elmgrove Avenue, which though naked of elms for many years 
            yet boasted other fine trees and many neatly manicured houses. We had 
            been told that if we should pass “University” we would have gone too 
            far, but in our California optimism we had not accounted for the fact 
            that many Providence streets remain totally free of signage. We could 
            not find “University” nor see the numbers on many of the houses and, 
            after some minutes and several long blocks, it became distressingly 
            apparent that we were lost. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We were now going to be late. We turned our car 
            around and headed back towards Wayland. Finally, behind a great, bold, 
            holly tree we espied an empty brick driveway that lead to the desired 
            number. The house awaiting us was dim and brooding, painted the darkest 
            of browns, with a forest green trim, as if it were dressed to be camouflaged 
            behind the masculine holly standing guard out front. No curtain was 
            drawn, no sound nor light emanated from within, all was totally quiet. 
            There was a strange metal box sitting by the door and an outdoor thermometer 
            reading 38 degrees nailed into a shingle. Steve pushed the doorbell 
            beside the heavy wooden door but, hearing no sound from within, he also 
            lifted the heavy brass knocker and gave it a few loud raps. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Though Keith stood in the hallway to bid us welcome 
            it was Rosmarie who opened the door. She was a small woman who looked 
            to be in her mid-fifties, with short, gray, attractively soft hair and 
            childlike eyes and smile, her youthful features temporarily distorted 
            by a look of worry provoked by our lateness. “Come in, come in,” she 
            said, in a somewhat hurried fashion, throwing one hand up into the air. 
            She seemed impatient to dispense with niceties and get quickly to real 
            conversation. It was then I noticed that she spoke with a slight accent 
            which, though I knew it to be German, did not sound German in the traditional 
            way. It was high and merry with what might be described as a <i>slight 
            growl</i> underneath, most evident when she chuckled. We were led through 
            not one door but two, to be greeted by Keith, a delicate looking man 
            with a long white beard and moustache, dressed in a diamond checked 
            pullover, dark trousers and house slippers. Before we could take two 
            steps he lifted aside a heavy curtain and, with a graceful sweep of 
            his hand, escorted us into the living room. All during this introduction 
            I had the distinct impression that I was walking through a large Victorian 
            curio cabinet or a Joseph Cornell box, the walls of which were made, 
            not of lathe and plaster nor dry-wall, but of thousands of old books. 
            These “book walls” tested our <i>politesse</i>, for it was all that 
            Steve or I could do not to turn our eyes from our hosts and begin, as 
            though we had come upon some bibliophilic paradise, to peruse the volumes 
            in earnest, searching, as one does in a used bookstore, for all the 
            books you suspect exist but have yet had the luck to find. Once inside 
            the living room, I saw to the left, in front of the fireplace, a long, 
            low, wooden bench. Every inch of this rough-hewn piece was burdened 
            with tall, rather precarious stacks of even more books. The right wall 
            of the room was entirely covered by many swathes of multi-colored fabric 
            hanging in soft sacs like some great organic anomaly, a vertical bed, 
            or a rare and rather sensuous three-dimensional wall-paper. Using her 
            reading glasses for a pointer, Rosmarie directed us to the two chairs 
            next to a little coffee table made out of tree stump with a piece of 
            Lucite on top of it. Steve took the Windsor and I the one that appeared 
            to have been stolen from a cinema, for it had the tell-tale fold-down 
            seat and holes in the base through which it had most likely been, in 
            its former life, riveted into a gummy floor. From there I could see 
            that the wall above the fireplace was covered with framed artworks, 
            many of which appeared to be collage. With the exception of one table 
            lamp and the luminous glow from a rather precarious and somewhat outdated 
            space heater, the room remained in shadow. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As soon as we were seated Keith nestled down into 
            the facing rocker in such a way as to give the impression that he had 
            <i>only just left it</i>. Rosmarie remained standing and, clasping her 
            hands together asked, “white wine, red wine or scotch,” then, to our 
            baffled looks, responded, “why don’t we start with the white.” “<i>Start 
            with the white!</i>” I thought, “will she require us to drink it all 
            before the evening is through?” She disappeared, her light steps trailing 
            down the wooden floorboards of the hallway into some mysterious region 
            hidden from the strange, if surprisingly comfortable, book lair in the 
            middle of which we were now ensconced.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rosmarie left us to the quiet of Keith’s rocking 
            for but a minute before returning with wine for us and a small glass 
            of orange juice for him. She also set between us, on the tree-stump 
            coffee table, a plate containing a dish of olives, salted almonds, and 
            a few rather challenging looking cheeses which soon seemed to be glistening 
            and ripening under the light from the goose-neck lamp hovering over 
            the table. Refreshments arranged, she then perched herself on the smaller 
            rocker to the side of the fireplace. After a welcoming toast, she began 
            the conversation by questioning us about our circumstance. As we had 
            come with a “verbal introduction” from our former professor Michael 
            Davidson, he was our first topic of discussion, after which Steve, being 
            a first-year graduate student, had plenty of fresh “department business” 
            to aid his initial remarks. Keith, though a full professor, was immediately 
            keen to differentiate himself from any talk of “the academy.” With a 
            marked delight he mocked the seriousness of his higher degree and then 
            told us that he had once been dismissed from an esteemed Connecticut 
            college for lecturing on DADA. I was under the burden of thinking myself 
            a talented young poet, but had little sense of how I might make this 
            known to my hosts, for I had no “official” role other than that of “Steve’s 
            girlfriend.” The incredibly diverse entourage of objects and books rescued 
            me from this awkwardness, for as titles caught my eye I could say, for 
            example, “<i>Zuleika Dobson</i>, is that any good?” Or, “I’ve heard 
            of <i>Botteghe Oscure</i>, but I’m not exactly sure what it is.” To 
            which Keith would respond, “Oh, that’s a wonderful novel,” or “that 
            was one of <i>the</i> great magazines.” Soon, however, this recourse, 
            and Keith’s confident responses, began to make me feel rather queer. 
            The wine had gone to my head and my eyes were starting to swim and drift 
            until, around the forty minute mark, I could scarcely distinguish between 
            book, collage and curio. The cheese filled my nose with some vague Parisian 
            memory and, when I noticed the sun had set and it was quite dark outside, 
            I began to feel as though Steve and I had been sitting in that living 
            room not for several hours, but for several days. The more great novels, 
            authors, places, operas, magazines and poems were brought up, very few 
            of which I had ever heard of, the less I seemed able to convince myself 
            of the uniqueness of my person. What I did not realize was that I was 
            becoming a victim of a serious malady which Steve has since coined as 
            “The Waldrop Effect,” the main symptom of which is the acute undoing 
            of one’s cultivated pretense. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Steve and I knew that our hosts were the publishers 
            of Burning Deck Press and, before we took our leave, we did not hesitate 
            to question them about this printing venture. At our interest Rosmarie, 
            who, unlike Keith, seemed hard-pressed to remain at rest, jumped up 
            and said “well, you must visit the dungeon!” Given my growing disorientation, 
            exacerbated by the onslaught of strange, literary references and the 
            several glasses of wine, I need hardly tell you the effect this dictum 
            had upon my psyche. “To the dungeon then!” Propriety would admit no 
            refusal. Out past the heavy curtain, down a dark hallway, through a 
            door, down a narrow flight of stairs, through several more doors, dim 
            lights illuminated <i>only as needed</i>, we descended in tandem to 
            the labyrinthine basement, the walls of which, I was astonished to find, 
            were also lined floor-to-ceiling with books. Seeing my bafflement Keith 
            gestured towards the dank volumes and then said, “European History.” 
            In a small room on the right we were shown their Heidelberg press, proudly 
            standing like the forgotten skeleton of some by-gone race of mechanical 
            beings. It was dark with ink and oil. There were two other, smaller 
            letter-presses and boxes upon boxes of metal type. How clean printed 
            volumes of delicate appearance issued from this dusty underground cavern 
            was mysterious indeed. But Rosmarie showed us several such chapbooks 
            before we made our ascent, stopping mid-way at a cold closet from which 
            she pulled some twenty-odd Burning Deck books to heap upon our outstretched 
            arms as a parting gift. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is now some eleven years since that first visit, 
            and I have sat in the living room of 71 Elmgrove more times than I can 
            possibly count. I have even spent a year in France undergoing an assiduous 
            course in alcohol consumption in order that I might someday keep up 
            with Rosmarie’s regime of “we’ll start with the white.” And yes, I have 
            matured. Since that first visit I have studied. I have read many books, 
            I have listened to many operas, I have tasted of many strange and odiferous 
            cheeses. Nevertheless I am still susceptible to succumbing to “The Waldrop 
            Effect.” And though I cannot tell you, dear reader, how to avoid this 
            curiously undocumented malady, I can describe the symptoms. The first 
            manifests itself mid-way through the evening when, slightly tipsy, your 
            insecurities awaken and your tongue loosens to such a degree that you 
            begin to pour all sorts of gossip into Rosmarie’s ear. The second arises 
            more slowly, but is more long lasting. You will know you are in the 
            midst of it when you feel that, no matter how broad and deep your education, 
            you know nothing at all. Nothing about film, nothing about dance, art, 
            opera, jazz, language, and especially nothing about literature. The 
            full dangers of “The Waldrop Effect,” however, only become apparent 
            once you leave that legendary living room. If, upon returning to your 
            private apartment, you fall face first onto your bed, head spinning 
            and belly full, and protract your misery with thoughts of the countless 
            books that Keith has read and you have not, then you know you are under 
            its sway. In that unflattering moment you may vow never to subject yourself 
            to its perils again. But I can with confidence assure you that, should 
            you recover your senses and break that vow, you will eventually grow, 
            if not immune, then at least more tolerant of its effects, and in time 
            you may even, as I confess I have, develop an <i>acute dependence</i> 
            on the rare company at its origin.&nbsp; </p>
