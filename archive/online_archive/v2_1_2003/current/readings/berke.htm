          <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As part of a larger article on which I am working 
              about Twentieth-Century American women poets’ representations of what 
              we now call “midlife,” I’d like to offer a few comments about Genevieve 
              Taggard.  In my book, <i>Women Poets on the Left, </i>I focused almost 
              exclusively on Taggard’s role as political poet and public intellectual, 
              which I tied to Taggard’s own admission that her <i>real</i> work 
              as a poet began in the 1930s, connected in large part to her commitments 
              to Depression-era social movements and the fight against fascism.  
              Yet Taggard’s poetry has always consisted of interesting intersections 
              between the private and the public.  Whereas the private Taggard can 
              be best found in poetry she published in the 1920s—poems such 
              as “Everyday Alchemy,” “Ice Age,” and “With Child”—the publication, 
              in 1936, of <i>Calling Western Union</i> is perhaps Taggard’s most 
              outspoken claim that poetry has and should have a public purpose.  
              As she urges fellow writers and readers at the end of “Definition 
              of Song,” “Swing the great stanza on the pavement,—use / The public 
              street for publishing good news.” </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is nevertheless important to note that throughout 
      Taggard’s career, from her lyrical representations of the personal struggles 
      informing her life as a radical within the social bohemia of 1920s Greenwich 
      Village, to her mid-life commitments as a member of the partisan left, her 
      poetry consistently presents significant tension between private and public 
      issues.  Taggard never completely abandons representing the self as an exclusive 
      subject as she moves from the feminist love lyric of her youth to the literary 
      staging of public protest in mid-life.  Thus I would like to suggest that 
      Taggard’s representation of middle age in poems such as “Middle-aged, Middle-class 
      Woman at Midnight,” written when she was 42, and “No Abstraction,” written 
      when she was 47, explore a conflicted midlife. In “Middle-aged, Middle-class 
      Woman at Midnight,” the midlife self is transcended in order to reveal the 
      outer political realities of a radically charged decade.  In “No Abstraction,” 
      the poet presents midlife as a time of increasing personal and social powerlessness.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I’d like to propose that “Middle-aged, Middle-class Woman 
      at Midnight,” and “No Abstraction” are statements about middle age, written 
      at a time before any such midlife discourses existed.  Although there are 
      other poems in which Taggard explores and complicates middle age, I find these 
      two particularly compelling.  Indeed, they endorse my view that women poets 
      of the modern period have much to teach us about women’s experiences at the 
      beginning of the last century, including, of course, the experience of aging. 
      These poems are also good examples of the ways in which the social category 
      of “middle age” was understood by feminists of Taggard’s generation.  I refer 
      to middle age as a social category here because, as feminist critic Margaret 
      Morganroth Gullette has recently argued, in our determination to point to 
      the myriad ways in which, for example, race and gender are socially constructed, 
      we have ignored how age and the aging process are socially determined as well.  
      We assume that aging is a “natural” act, when in fact we are “aged by culture” 
      (3).</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To further advance a critique of “age ideology,” Gullette 
      argues that while “ageism is an ancient prejudice,” . . . “Middle-ageism is 
      our own local twentieth-century toxin” (3).  Gullette contends that the “explosion 
      of mid-life discourse that began in the early 1970s” also ushered in the beginning 
      of an age ideology that has manipulated the “baby-boom” generation into a 
      subtle as well as coercive discourse.  As Gullette explains, “through the 
      blue smoke, age ideology has moved the “problem” of aging backwards—from 
      old age into the middle years and toward even younger ages.  Despite the longevity 
      revolution that began a century ago, we are being aged by culture younger 
      all the time” (4).  Gullette suggests that the “fear of fifty,” so prevelent 
      among today’s baby-boom generation, is moving scarily backwards; soon we will 
      approach forty with similar dread, returning us to the age of “decline” found 
      in Taggard’s generation—but perhaps with one slight difference.  Taggard’s 
      generation was busy fighting other battles.  Her Depression-era mirror did 
      not primarily reflect signs of feminine decline, but rather it reflected back 
      a fortunate self who took her sagging and graying with her to the front, in 
      the fight for peace and social justice.  Today we live in a culture that, 
      with a few notable exceptions, no longer makes social movements because it 
      no longer believes in the possibility of social change.  We turn our fears 
      inward and look into the same ageist mirror that the speaker in “No Abstraction” 
      confronts with anger, but also resignation.   </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is true that middle age had a different time frame 
      for those women poets who, like Taggard, came of (middle) age in the 1930s.  
      Many women born in the 1890s could still expect to live half as long as those 
      women born several generations later. As we sit atop the twenty-first century, 
      we have by now gotten past Abbie Hoffman’s dictum that thirty rings the death 
      knell to youth’s integrity.  In 1920, however, when the then thirty-six year 
      old “love” poet Sara Teasdale published her book <i>Flame and Shadow, </i>she 
      was already producing numerous maudlin sketches about feminine decline. Curiously, 
      the slightly younger Taggard, in transforming herself from flapper-era love 
      lyricist to Depression-era socialist-feminist, public intellectual, began 
      to represent a different kind of middle age—politically resonant and passionate.  
      Yet as I suggest here, Taggard cannot completely escape being aged by culture 
      through her radicalism alone.  No such acts of resistance existed—well—except 
      for the practice of refusal she found by writing poetry.  Taggard died from 
      complications of high-blood pressure when she was fifty-two years old—a woman 
      in the <i>prime</i> of <i>midlife</i>. (When I intimated to Taggard’s daughter, 
      Marcia Liles, that perhaps the stress from the paranoid, Cold War climate 
      of FBI surveillance and blacklists might have hastened the decline in her 
      mother’s already fragile health, Marcia curtly responded that it was “kidney 
      failure”.)  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Gullette’s work is also important because she is one 
      of the few feminist critics to attempt to devise a theory of middle age as 
      a socially constructed ideological discourse that must be resisted.  What 
      interested me in the work of American women poets on the left was how their 
      poetry established, to use Alan Wald’s phrase, a “premature socialist-feminist” 
      literary theory and poetics of resistance. At a time when socialist-feminism 
      (a now <i>unfashionable</i> term) was not a fully synthesized and realized 
      critical practice, poets like Genevieve Taggard, Lola Ridge, Muriel Rukeyser, 
      and Margaret Walker were writing poems that engaged in social critique from 
      their respective positions as leftists and feminists.  Thus I am interested 
      in how Taggard represents middle age, and its contradictory meanings in her 
      life and work.  </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Middle-aged, Middle-class Woman at Midnight,” 
              from <i>Calling Western Union</i>, the poet identifies herself and 
              women like her whose source of alienation is not only their age and 
              class, but their separation from the sites of class struggle.  In 
              typical structure of much proletarian literature being written during 
              the Depression, “Middle-aged, Middle-class Woman at Midnight” explores 
              how the poem’s speaker moves from an isolated, depressive state to 
              one of social consciousness as she compares her fortunate lot to the 
              hunger filled lives of laboring families in central Vermont, where 
              in the winter of 1936 marble workers went out on strike against the 
              Vermont Marble Company.  The poem’s action begins with its speaker’s 
              sleeplessness and self-absorption.  But as she takes “Veronal in vain,” 
              the “stealthy cold, old terror / of the poor” impresses itself upon 
              her psyche, disrupting the sedative’s effects. In contrast to the 
              midlife self represented in “Middle-aged, Middle-class Woman at Midnight,” 
              in which the poem’s speaker ultimately identifies with the working-poor 
              whose misery is immeasurably greater than her own, in “No Abstraction,” 
              which appeared in <i>Long View</i>, Taggard’s 1942 follow-up to <i>Calling 
              Western Union, </i>the speaker is alone, face to face with her mirror-image: 
              “Never so clearly in mirror / Caught I this—age in the edges.”<i> 
              </i>  Here Taggard represents middle age as a time of decline, a time 
              to cede one’s potential powers. Although <i>Long View, </i>as a collection 
              of poetry, contains many poems of political ardency, “No Abstraction” 
              stands out as the private scream the poet lets out in between the 
              biting satire and passionate pleas for social justice that are characteristic 
              of much of Taggard’s later (and midlife) work. In “No Abstraction,” 
              Taggard uses the essential metaphor of hair to represent middle age 
              decline and the loss of “femininity.”  Her dying hair has “lost the 
              childish tousle” and “quick swirl,” and further symbolizes a loss 
              of vitality and vibrancy.  It might just as well disappear altogether 
              like the poet, like the woman at midlife.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Middle-age Middle-class Woman 
      at Midnight” reveals the possibility that youth’s decline is only met with 
      the freedom to remove a focus on the self—on appearance and personal comforts—toward 
      a focus on the greater humanity.  Taggard mocks the mink-coats, heated taxis 
      and orchids of middle-class femininity.  They are trivial compared to the 
      children who “shrivel” from malnutrition in their “Ford towns.”  “No Abstraction” 
      refuses to read middle-class femininity as trivial.  Decline is an inevitable 
      and painful social (and physical) process that the poet symbolizes through 
      the image of dying hair. The poem describes a “body obedient” to the aging 
      process.  It explores resignation, with no political solution or possibility.  
      There is no working-class struggle for the middle-class woman as she confronts 
      midlife.  There is no social movement that contains her ranks, nor those in 
      solidarity with them.  “No Abstraction” explores what it means to be a forty-seven 
      year old woman in an ageist and sexist culture.  And it motions toward a movement 
      yet to be born.  Hence both these poems with their wholly different emphases 
      suggest that without a working theory of how midlife operates as a disabling, 
      socially produced limitation, creative tensions between resistance and collusion 
      surface.  “Middle-aged, Middle-class Woman at Midnight” and “No Abstraction” 
      pose contrary positions about mid life for the middle-aged radical poet to 
      sort through and document.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The subject of “Middle-aged, Middle-class Woman at Midnight” 
      is ultimately not about middle-age decline, but rather about middle-class 
      indifference to corporate greed and power and its dehumanizing effects upon 
      working-class families. Yet for the socially isolated poet, her subject offers 
      her a way out of a socially constructed middle-age (and middle-class) malaise.  
      The poem works as a form of self-disengagement.  The poet reaches outside 
      the limits imposed by age and class in order to focus her attention on helping 
      to alleviate the misery of others—the “hunger that has no haste.” What is 
      more, “Midde-aged, Middle-class Woman at Midnight” mirrors the poet’s own 
      political activism. At the time she wrote this poem, Taggard was a member 
      of the United Committee to Aid Vermont Marble Workers, which was organized 
      by the socialist painter and illustrator Rockwell Kent, to alert the public 
      and pressure the company executives to the inadequate conditions under which 
      marble company workers and their families lived.  Taggard resided part-time 
      in Vermont, somewhere in between the starving, mostly immigrant families that 
      worked the marble quarries, supplying the government with its bloody marble 
      halls (to paraphrase New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio), and the Proctor 
      family, the wealthy owners of the Vermont Marble Company, whose workers had 
      been denied the right to organize a union.  As Taggard’s committee colleague, 
      Sarah Cleghorn, a Vermont poet, social reformer and antiwar activist, wrote 
      in the <i>New Masses, </i>“The workers were encouraged to remain the feudal 
      type of worker, in a safe and contented state of tutelage, perpetual minors 
      in the industrial world” (21).<i> </i></p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Middle age, as it is traditionally constructed, is a 
      time of decline, a time for sedation, a time to “take stock,” to become “more 
      conservative with age”—to cite several popular clichés. With “Middle-aged, 
      Middle-class Woman at Midnight” Taggard rejects such passive models. The poem’s 
      speaker can’t sleep, tries a sedative but remains wide awake.  It is not the 
      “continent-wide / Iron bitter. . .Ten below” that keeps her awake, but the 
      knowledge that “[i]n Vermont near the marble-quarries” children freeze and 
      starve while “their fathers accept tear gas and blackjacks.”  Her sleep, which 
      might be eased by Veronal, were she more inclined to identify with the mink-coated 
      women climbing out of heated taxis, is the wakefulness of a raised consciousness.  
      In contrast, “No Abstraction” presents no forum of identification, no labor 
      organization or support committee in which to join, nothing in the poet’s 
      activist biography can be connected to these solemn words of resignation.  
      Written twenty odd years after the passage of the 19th amendment and just 
      as many more before the rebirth of feminism in the late nineteen-sixties, 
      “No Abstraction” reveals the kind of self-imposed surrender that is unique 
      to Taggard’s writing even at its most private.  It is hopeless as the subject 
      of decline is hopeless without a movement creating the possibility of new 
      avenues with which to combat the socially decreed discourses that surround 
      the subject of middle age. Arguing that internalization of middle-ageism becomes 
      a collective cultural script, Margaret Gullette insists that “[d]ecline can 
      make losing seem like the only form of life—irresistible” (8).</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Since the trope of the body has been important to both 
      women’s writing and the left tradition in modern American poetry, I’d like 
      briefly to address how Taggard represents the body as part of her commentary 
      on middle age. In “Middle-aged, Middle-class Woman at Midnight” the body is 
      sleepless and lacks the comfort it is presumed would accompany the midlife 
      of a middle-class woman.  It is the bodies of working class families that 
      are the object of the speaker’s concern.  They are cold and hungry.  Their 
      bodily strength is compromised.  The speaker cannot accept comfort when it 
      cannot be distributed evenly (the way weight is ideally distributed upon a 
      body). In “No Abstraction,” the speaker laments being trapped in an aging 
      body.  While the central bodily trope of aging is the speaker’s hair, in the 
      poem’s third stanza it is not only her old hair that she despairs, but also 
      her body’s increasing girth.  Strong, muscular bodies of workingmen and the 
      sturdy bodies of their women, (championed through both domestic labor and 
      the <i>labor</i> of childbirth), were significant features of much left literature 
      of the period. Yet here, Taggard renders the weight as “obedient;” heaviness 
      becomes a sign of age rather than strength.  Also of note, the then popular 
      Marxian paradigm imagined the working class (and the working class body) through 
      its historical and collective agency; the aging body as constructed here has 
      no such power:</p>
    <P>                       The old, the only body<br>
                             Makes no cave in mirrors,<br>
                             No monster shade</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Middle-aged, Middle-class Woman at Midnight” the 
      contrast of hunger with comfort suggests that the speaker understands her 
      own complicity with the state of affairs in central Vermont.  The faces of 
      children “hungrier than rodents,” hunger that “haunt[s] the houses of farmers,” 
      ensures the speaker’s resolve to support the right side.  The middle-aged, 
      middle-class woman recognizes that her comfort comes at a great cost.  If 
      the children of this country are in trouble then everyone is in trouble. That 
      hunger and cold are the two most often repeated words in the poem also reminds 
      us that these are “keywords” of Depression-era America.  Yet it is not just 
      the poet’s identification with Vermont’s cold and hungry laboring families 
      that inspires her social critique.  She is able to make an ironic connection 
      to the situation of the city poor.  They cannot pay to heat their flats so 
      they cannot use gas as a painless means of suicide.  They cannot alleviate 
      their “depression” by dying if they can’t afford to pay the gas bill.  Nor 
      can they find the middle ground and sedate themselves because “Veronal” costs 
      money.  What begins as a complaint by a middle-aged woman becomes <i>universalized</i> 
      (to use another unpopular word) into every single person’s complaint, well, 
      except of course for the rich who have their heated taxis, mink coats and 
      hothouse flowers.  Nor is there is little comfort expressed in “No Abstraction.“  
      The speaker agrees to “[s]ay it clearly; this is dying.”  She begrudgingly 
      announces her commonality with old women, but it is not the same kind of camaraderie 
      that is found in a solidarity campaign. “No Abstraction” is a far cry from 
      the moving social dilemma that brought hundreds of like-minded individuals 
      together in support of starving families and greedy quarry owners. Such collective 
      power is dispersed.  The speaker admits “all powers work inward now.”  The 
      cold, “iron bitter” of the Vermont struggle is now the “dying centre” of the 
      middle-aged, female body, “Outcast, cold.”</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Although “Middle-aged, Middle-class 
      Woman at Midnight” and “No Abstraction” are wholly different in their representations 
      of midlife—the first expressing the poet’s public voice and the latter her 
      private voice—both poems end with a challenge to social conventions. The first 
      makes a claim for social commitment as an act of resistance, and the second 
      asks why the midlife woman must acquiesce to what has been determined for 
      her.  As previously noted in “Middle-aged, Middle-class Woman at Midnight,” 
      the cynicism of city life is marked off by the italicized references to no 
      money for gas, no money to die.  Yet as the poet names the culprits at the 
      end of the poem, middle-ageism is notably absent, “Sheriffs, cops, / Boss 
      of the town, union enemy, crooks and cousins, / I hope the people win.”  Yet 
      “No Abstraction” is not completely without the poet’s understanding of the 
      damaging consequences of a socially imposed attitude about midlife.  “Middle-aged, 
      Middle-class Woman at Midnight” follows the formula of proletarian writing 
      by rejecting the personal over the political. It resolves itself in a call 
      to action, “I hope the people win”—a poetic line that would surely have got 
      Pound and Eliot’s hackles up.  In the last stanza of “No Abstraction,” Taggard 
      returns to old hair and the speaker’s hope for acceptance into the company 
      of old women, where there is no transition from middle to old age; the two 
      are blurred together.  Importantly, Taggard moves from speaking to and for 
      those living on the world’s margins, to reflecting upon a middle age that 
      marginalizes women (“old women accept me in your company”).  This company 
      is at least “truthful” if it must be “unattractive.”  But the speaker also 
      poses a question to which she does not <i>yet </i>have an answer:</p>
            <P>                  Who loved myself that I was 
              young<br>
                                And the earth with me and in me,<br>
                    Must I 
      hate myself that I am old<br>
                    And the 
      earth not with me, not in me?</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">By asking whether the aging process should automatically 
      force women to regret their passing youth and loathe their aging selves, Taggard 
      tacitly attempts to resist age ideology.  She implicates the fairness of judging 
      women based on the superficial structures of youth and its accompanying beauty.  
      More to the point, she questions in these final lines the constructedness 
      of youth and beauty as well as the constructedness of aging.  Still, the poem, 
      in its quietness, its personal focus, its implosion of pain, leaves readers 
      sharing the poet’s sense of loss and social collusion, which seems odd for 
      the public voice we have come to identify in Taggard’s later poetry.  It is 
      precisely this oddity, this contrast between the public claims of “Middle-aged, 
      Middle-class Woman at Midnight” and the personal lament of “No Abstraction,” 
      that Taggard inadvertently complicates by writing political poetry as a woman 
      at midlife. </p>
