        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">A Review by Catherine Daly</P>
        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P><blockquote>
        <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In her first book, Genevieve Taggard writes poems 
      recognizable in theme:  they are poems of a young woman in a poetry community 
      where she finds few positive female examples for writing or being, yet wishes 
      to write from her experience as a woman, wife, and mother.  Although I have 
      read disparaging comparisons of these lyric poems to those of Sara Teasdale, 
      Elinor Wylie, or Edna St. Vincent Millay, including those made by the poet 
      herself later in her life, I find key differences:  Taggard is not a member 
      of the middle class during this period of her life, as Teasdale and Wylie 
      were; she is political and feminist, but her politics are not Ridge’s anarchism 
      or Millay’s flapper version of the “new woman”; she is well educated, with 
      a degree from UC Berkeley; she is a versifier, but she is not a particularly 
      fine sonneteer or notable epigrammatist.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In <i>For Eager Lovers</i>, Taggard genericized 
      her unhappy relationship to Robert L. Wolf in a series of poems where a female 
      speaker alternately pleads to see the beloved / lover and begs to be left 
      alone, “Married,” “Leave Me Alone a Little,” “Black Laughter,” “The Quiet 
      Woman,” and “Unacknowledged Dedication” among them.  Marital discord is depicted; 
      phrases including “thick vowels,” “black laughter,” and “words too thick to 
      say” are used in different poems to indicate words spoken in anger.  In “Black 
      Laughter,” she writes:</p>
    <P>            See what a cripple our love is!<br>
                  It is sullen; sometimes it makes walls of black laughter;<br>
                  It is fond of words, fond of thick vowels,<br>
                  It mimics thunder.<br>
                  Between us it limps…</p> </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the poem which follows “Black Laughter” in the 
      collection, “The Quiet Woman,” she seems to describe a woman having nonconsensual 
      sex:  “If you knew…” how the narrator thought and felt, “You would not lean 
      . . . to kiss my body, quivering and cold.”  In “Little Hamlet,” she switches 
      roles:</p>
            <P>           Over you, over you, over,<br>
                  I hang like a wave, like a lover,<br>
                 Like a scimitar edged with hate. . .</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>For Eager Lovers </i>is, among other things, 
      a warning to young women.  In the poems, Taggard does not show only romanticism 
      and the personal, as do Wylie and Teasdale.  She is not interested in showing 
      the “suffering of love,” but rather, the ways in which personal or emotional 
      suffering imperils a woman writer.  While <i>For Eager Lovers </i>is dedicated 
      to her then-husband, she writes, in “Unacknowledged Dedication,”</p>
    <P>           These were his songs.  Now he has broken them.<br>
                   All he has made, that he has also slain;<br>
                 Seeing my beauty budding, broke the 
      stem . . .</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Taggard’s first husband, Robert L. Wolf, was a poet 
      who never published a book of poetry.  By contrast, during the period the 
      poems in <i>For Eager Lovers</i> were written, Taggard worked for a major 
      publisher of poetry in New York (Huebsch, which published Lola Ridge, among 
      others) and was a founding editor of a well-known journal, <i>Measure</i>.  
      Wolf seems to have been ambivalent about parenthood; Taggard supported the 
      small family so that he could write. </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poem “Everyday Alchemy,” one of the two Taggard 
      chose to reprint in <i>Calling Western Union, </i>to give the poem an impersonally 
      political context instead of the personal and political one here, is a poem 
      in which Taggard defines her metaphysic.  Because Taggard edited an anthology 
      of metaphysical-influenced verse and was the first to argue that Emily Dickinson 
      was a latter-day metaphysical poet, critics suggest that Taggard was influenced 
      by the metaphysicals.  Taggard explicitly uses John Donne’s extended metaphor 
      and unusual imagery in his love poems in <i>For Eager Lovers</i>.  In “Everyday 
      Alchemy,” she sets out the binary relationship between nature and “worn men” 
      who will never know nature.  </p>
    <P>           . . . There<br>
                        Is all the meager peace men get—no otherwhere; <br>
                No mountain space, no tree with placid leaves, <br>
                Or heavy gloom beneath a young girl's hair,<br>
                No sound of valley bell on autumn air,<br>
                        Or room made home with doves along the eves . . . </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Nature has peace.  Women can create peace, but not 
      for themselves.  Men cannot know the peace of nature or create peace.  In 
      “Ice Age,” in which Taggard extends her rhymed lyric across several pages, 
      she imagines a future ice age that  will destroy the abundant and always tropical 
      and Hawaiian nature which is her moral good.  In this cold dystopia, only 
      “singing” matters.  As in “Everyday Alchemy,” men are the singers, but only 
      worn women can create, and only a little bit, and this creation ultimately 
      saps their strength:</p>
    <P>            Men will go on<br>
                  Making vague love, kissing wan faces.<br>
                  Trying to make<br>
                  Children with women . . .</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poems in the pamphlet <i>Hawaiian Hilltop</i>, 
      published a year after <i>For Eager Lovers</i>, continue to develop these 
      ideas.  Although Taggard does not identify either gender with nature,  she 
      sets men in binary opposition to nature while she represents women and children 
      interacting with nature’s bounty.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Motherhood, in Taggard’s view, is embedded in the 
      fecundity of nature and the necessary communality of marriage.  In “With Child,” 
      she identifies the period of pregnancy as one during which her body, not her 
      desiring self, is associated with nature, while her fetus, not her body, is 
      associated with beauty.  The poem begins as Taggard distinguishes herself 
      from standards of beauty:</p>
    <P>            Now I am slow and placid, fond of sun,<br>
                   Like a sick beast, or a worn one:<br>
                  No slim and languid girl . . .</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the center of the poem, she carefully delineates 
      her relationship to nature and to the child:</p>
    <P>            Earth’s urge, not mine – my little death, 
      not hers;<br>
                   And the pure beauty yearns and stirs 
      . . .</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is important to note that, as on the page, in 
      life she never seems to have shirked her responsibilities as a mother.  She 
      depicts the economic effects and social ramifications of childbearing and 
      rearing in her writing, but she always writes positively about and for children 
      of both sexes.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After Wolf was institutionalized and the couple 
      divorced, Taggard remarried.  It is not until this remarriage, to an American 
      working for Tass, that Taggard became middle class, with teaching jobs at 
      small liberal arts colleges and a farm in Vermont to use during vacation periods.  
      Taggard displays a great deal of tendentious sympathy for working poor and 
      poor blue collar workers, as well as for urban immigrant women, but quite 
      little for the rural poor whites and white collar working class people of 
      her own experience.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">* * * </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There are three “girl poems” in <i>For Eager Lovers</i>:  
      “Tropical Girl to Her Garden,” “The Enamel Girl,” and “Tired Girl.”  This 
      type of descriptive lyric of a part-icon, part-muse, part-self is fairly common 
      to find in twentieth century first books of poetry by women.  This type of 
      poem represents an attempt to objectify poetry itself.  However, the Lady 
      of Shalott, Laura, or any number of other female muses / female stand-ins 
      for poetry itself in poetry written by men are almost “ready mades” in terms 
      of objectification.  When a woman is the poet, the objectified woman is an 
      aspect of self as well as a muse or poetry.  This figure is most often a “girl” 
      – younger, dumb/mute or less intelligent, and less experienced – partially 
      because she is objectified.  In some respect, these figures of Taggard’s are 
      her children – creations, and she is mothering these aspects of herself; she 
      very clearly repeats in the poems that it is men who “sing,” “name,” or write 
      poems – while the collection includes “song” poems with refrains and choruses, 
      most of her poems create worlds or instruct rather than identify or describe.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Tropical Girl to Her Garden,” the girl is nature, 
      speaking against cultivation.  While the Hawaiian girls in the poems in <i>Hawaiian 
      Hilltop </i>are native “others,” this girl is an “I,” the narrator:</p>
     <P>            Withhold your hand!<br>
                     My boughs are bent with gold  . . . <br>
                   . . .<br>
                   My heavy fruit will fall without a touch</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Only by speaking as nature can Taggard, as a human, 
      relate to nature, and only a woman, in her view, could relate to nature.  
      In “Enamel Girl,” Taggard discusses beauty and artifice.  The girl who speaks 
      is afraid of beauty, which is always outside or “other” for a female.  She 
      would be a fragile object among fragile objects, except that she has learned 
      she has power to destroy beauty.  The “you” – addressee, lover, reader – has 
      taught her to fear her power:</p>
     <P>            . . .<br>
                          . . . I wound a wing <br>
              <br>
                         With one caress, with one kiss<br>
                 Break most fragile ecstasies . . .   <br>
      <br>
                         Now terror touches me when I<br>
                 Dream I am touching a butterfly.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">and to fear poetry-writing.  In “Tired Girl,” the 
      girl is in the third person.  The narrator is asking nature to let the girl 
      rest or die (recalling the saying, “you can sleep when you’re dead”) so that, 
      reborn, she can become a woman like those in “Everyday Alchemy,” who, while 
      tired, can create “peace” for men, and also write:</p>
     <P>           After she ponders under silent hills,<br>
                 Beneath your swarming bosom, Mother Earth,<br>
                 She will have words for her beloved one.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The girl poems contain the same metaphysical meanings 
      Taggard began to develop in this first book and continued to develop throughout 
      her career.  They display some of Taggard’s struggles to write as a female 
      poet with few female poet forebears as well as her struggles as a working 
      mother.  She struggles not to romanticize her experiences.  She addresses 
      different audiences in different poems.  She attempts various forms of address 
      and depiction as she searches for a form and content beyond male standards 
      of “beauty” and civilization’s association of women with natural beauty and 
      untutored artifice.  The poems are political and feminist, but they are also 
      individualistic.  </p>
