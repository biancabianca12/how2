        <P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="CENTER">by Brian Reed</P>
       
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In <i>Leaving Lines of Gender </i>(2000), Ann Vickery 
            announces an ambitious project, a cartography of women’s experimental 
            poetry that attends first and foremost to its “practice,” that is, the 
            specific modes, means, and occasions of its production. For Vickery, 
            elucidating poetic practice does not imply a retreat into an ahistorical 
            formalism. On the contrary, it “involves reframing many aspects of . 
            . . poetic practice in order to link text with context”: 
        <blockquote> 
          Aspects that must be addressed include the multiple 
            text (its written or performed versions), the text-in-process (drafting, 
            editing, and reprinting), the relationship between readers and the text, 
            the use of particular poetic forms, the structure of small-press culture 
            and its marketplace, and the social politics of poetry (as manifested 
            in how poetic communities relate to one another and the individuals). 
            These may be further contextualized in larger social and cultural structures, 
            including the media and pedagogic institutions. (15)
        </blockquote>
        
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Exploring “the shifting ‘mess’ that encapsulates 
            actual poetic practice” serves a dual function. On the one hand, it 
            “maps out interweaving, multiple lines of affiliation” in all their 
            complexity, thereby forestalling falsely reductive or atomistic treatment 
            of experimental writing by women. On the other hand, it charts “the 
            debates arising out of difference, whether these be regional, aesthetic, 
            cultural, or ideological.” Highlighting “difference” in this manner 
            exposes the partiality or strategic blindspots in totalizing accounts 
            of contemporary innovative verse (13).</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Inspired by Vickery’s turn to “practice” as a means 
            of clarifying recent literary history, this essay extends her cartographic 
            enterprise into new territory. It closely examines the writerly practice 
            of Rosmarie Waldrop, who has not only enjoyed three decades’ prominence 
            as an American experimental poet but who has also actively promoted 
            avant-garde literature as a publisher (Burning Deck Press), as a teacher 
            (Brown University), and as a translator (of Elke Erb, Helmut Heissenbütttel, 
            Edmond Jabès, and many other post-World War II Continental writers).<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [1] </span></a> Moreover, a German immigrant to the United States, Waldrop 
            has proved throughout her career to be exceptionally sensitive to the 
            displacements, imbalances, and transpositions instigated by movement 
            between nations, cultures, and languages. Her poetry is resolutely hybrid 
            — “between,” as she would say — as well as thoroughly secular and skeptical, 
            preferring wit to ecstasy, insight to murkiness, and precision to evocative 
            vagueness. An inquiry into Waldrop’s compositional practice exposes 
            the degree to which American innovative writing remains implicated in 
            the trans-Atlantic crossings, collisions, and dispossessions that mark 
            and mar so much of the country’s past. Waldrop seeks through her writing 
            a means of dwelling creatively, sustainingly in this chaotic, contested 
            terrain.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This essay follows Vickery in its preference for 
            thick description of the specifics of poetic practice — in this case, 
            of “text-in-process,” “the relationship between readers and the text,” 
            and “the use of particular poetic forms” as well as the “larger social 
            and cultural structures” which constitute their horizon. Collage, one 
            of Waldrop’s favorite writerly devices, is well known for its ability 
            to destabilize textual boundaries, unsettle authorship, transgress generic 
            distinctions, and otherwise dramatize writing’s refusal to buttress 
            any system of knowledge univocally and unequivocally; by exploring how, 
            when, and why Waldrop adopted a collage-based aesthetic, one begins 
            to perceive the “affiliations” and “differences” that demarcate the 
            consequent purpose, value, and function of the technique in her verse. 
            Moreover, as Vickery predicts, this close scrutiny of poetic practice 
            exposes both “unpredictable relationships” and “hidden or elided” distinctions 
            within the field of present-day experimental writing. Although a complete 
            picture of how Waldrop’s use of collage situates her in relation to 
            her contemporaries — and how this network of relations has in turn manifested 
            itself in what Vickery calls the “social politics of poetry” — will 
            have to await further study and elaboration, this essay makes it possible 
            to discern key pieces of that future account (15). Unlike, say, Susan 
            Howe, whose use of collage signals her qualified participation in the 
            Pound-Olson tradition, Waldrop looks to alternative, Middle European 
            sources to give her the confidence to move through and beyond the ideogrammic 
            method of <i>The Cantos</i>. She employs collage less for its ability 
            to introduce the raw stuff of history into a poem than as a means of 
            encouraging her readers to compare, contrast, and otherwise interrogate 
            the strategies and assumptions at play in different discourses. Collage 
            enables her to transform “betweenness” from marginality to a mode of 
            intervention and critique. </p>
          
        <div align="center">I. </div>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 2001, Northwestern University Press reissued 
            Rosmarie Waldrop’s experimental fictions <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter 
            </i>and <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>. In an introduction titled 
            “Between, Always,” Waldrop reports that these two novels represent more 
            than an interlude in a writing career devoted primarily to poetry. In 
            fact, she explains, they played indispensable roles in the development 
            of her principle art form. <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> marks 
            the end to a phase in her career as a poet, insofar as it enabled her 
            to escape from a compositional rut. More specifically, it provided her 
            with a capaciousness of form that made it possible for her to explore 
            viable alternatives to fast-moving, short-line, syntactically ambiguous 
            mode that had come to predominate in her verse in the later 70s and 
            early 80s (viii).<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [2] </span></a> In contrast, Waldrop attributes to <i>A Form / of Taking 
            / It All</i> the status of a new beginning. In this mixed-genre piece 
            she chose to make “Collage, juxtaposition . . . the heart of the book” 
            to a degree unparalleled in her earlier work. Although she had “used 
            collage before,” while writing <i>A Form</i> in the years 1983-1985 
            she hit upon an “art of separation and fusion, of displacement and connection” 
            that has served as the “main procedure” of her subsequent poetry, down 
            to the present day (xvi-xvii).<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [3] </span></a> </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s claim that the novel <i>A Form / of Taking 
            / It All</i> records an artistic turning point is rather surprising. 
            A jagged, four-part, prose-and-verse retelling of an impossible, “mystical 
            marriage” between Amy Lowell and Alexander von Humboldt, <i>A Form / 
            of Taking / It All </i>is an exceptional, even peculiar work within 
            Waldrop’s <i>oeuvre</i> that has received scant attention from reviewers, 
            critics, and other poets.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [4] </span></a> Its melodramatic treatment of Lowell’s and von Humboldt’s 
            “more or less suppressed homosexuality” yokes together sections written 
            in such disparate styles as stream of consciousness, commonplace book, 
            metafictional commentary, and free verse (xv). This rather unnerving 
            formal heterogeneity is matched by the incongruity of the book’s contents. 
            The concluding bibliography of sources lists textbooks on astronomy, 
            chemistry, and ballet; biographies of Beethoven and Napoleon; American 
            avant-garde poetry; Austrian avant-garde novels; histories of the Spanish 
            conquest of Mexico; the <i>WPA Guide to Washington, D.C.</i>; and a 
            technical manual for undertakers (<i>A Form </i>248). Reading <i>A Form 
            / of Taking / It All</i> at the time of its completion, one would have 
            been hard pressed to guess that Waldrop would soon turn to writing the 
            elegant, witty, erudite prose poetry that characterizes <i>Reproduction 
            of Profiles</i> (1987), <i>Shorter American Memory </i>(1988), <i>Lawn 
            of the Excluded Middle </i>(1993), and <i>Reluctant Gravities </i>(1999). 
          </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As Kornelia Freitag has pointed out, however, by 
            the time that she wrote “Unpredicted Particles,” the fourth part of 
            <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>, Waldrop was already engaged in the 
            practice of selectively (mis)quoting Ludwig Wittgenstein’s writings 
            that would become a hallmark of these later writings.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [5] </span></a> The first page of “Unpredicted Particles” includes the 
            lines</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          “the grammar of the word ‘knows’<br>
            is closely related to that of<br>
            ‘mastery’” (237)
        </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">which, as Freitag informs us, derive from <i>Philosophical 
            Investigations</i> # 150: “The grammar of the word ‘knows’ is evidently 
            closely related to that of ‘can,’ ‘is able to’. But also closely related 
            to that of ‘understands’. (‘Mastery’ of a technique)” (“Rosmarie Waldrop’s 
            Language Games” 257). Omitting the softening “evidently” and all but 
            one word after “closely related to,” Waldrop transforms Wittgenstein’s 
            original, rather abstract statement into a Foucault-like observation 
            concerning the imbrication of knowledge and power. The next few lines 
            — “the difference / in a window / in Genoa” — rapid-fire connects the 
            Wittgenstein misquotation to several of the key themes in <i>A Form 
            / of Taking / It All</i>: representation (“in a window”), otherness 
            (“difference”), and the confrontation between European colonizers and 
            New World colonized (“Genoa,” an oblique reference to Columbus, who 
            will emerge as the protagonist of “Unpredicted Particles”) (237). In 
            short, Waldrop offers us a staccato reprise of the basics of postcolonial 
            theory, as articulated by Fritz Fanon, Gayatri Spivak, and an array 
            of other thinkers. While not as subtle or sophisticated as the responses 
            to Wittgenstein that would soon appear in Waldrop’s <i>Reproduction 
            of Profiles</i>, we can nonetheless observe here in germ the same general 
            methods of composition and commentary.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i> thus deserves 
            scrutiny as a transitional work, prefiguring the philosophical and formal 
            preoccupations that mark Waldrop’s writings of the last fifteen years. 
            Moreover, it is uniquely appropriate to examine the process of “transition” 
            in Waldrop’s writing — especially when that examination necessitates 
            closer scrutiny of an aberrantly mixed-genre work. As she reminds us 
            in “Between, Always,” she “feel[s] a strong affinity for this word, 
            ‘between’” (which in fact served as the “title of one of [her] first 
            poems in English” )(vii).<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [6] </span></a> This sense of occupying an indefinite, intermediary 
            zone became particularly acute in the aftermath of writing <i>The Hanky 
            of Pippin’s Daughter</i>, which was initially received as “too ornate, 
            too metaphorical,” in short, too poetic to qualify as a straight-ahead 
            novel.</p>
        
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=Section1>I found myself in . . . [a] place between genres. 
            Between poem and novel. Between verse and prose.</div>
          <div class=Section1><br>
            Between two stools. A bad spot. Supposedly. Close to the middle excluded 
            by the law. Bud does a door have to be open or closed? All words are 
            ajar. Could I not settle in the between? Like most truly contemporary 
            writing? And could I not, like Luce Irigaray, make it not only a third 
            term between binaries but a locus of desire? Of encounter? Dynamic and 
            dynamite?</div>
          <div class=Section1><br>
            I went on to another novel — which, if we count the title, begins and 
            ends in verse. (xv)</div>
        </blockquote>
         
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In other words, <i>A Form / of Taking / It All 
            </i>— the novel she alludes to at the end of this passage — might be 
            through-and-through a jumbled, contradictory text. Even its title perplexes, 
            as Waldrop notes. Its combination of italics and virgules mixes codes 
            by suggesting, on the one hand, that “A Form of Taking It All” is the 
            name of a work of literature and, on the other hand, that the phrase 
            is a quotation from a lineated poem.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [7] </span></a> The book’s resolute refusal to resolve, its straining 
            at cross-currents, in short, its in-betweenness, is the very stuff of 
            Waldrop’s poetics. </p>
          <p align="center">II.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Between, Always” Waldrop reveals that the proximate 
            inspiration for her turn to collage in <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i> 
            was an innovative Austrian prose piece, Konrad Bayer’s <i>Der Kopf des 
            Vitus Bering</i> (1965) (xv-xvi). This choice seems to have been dictated 
            by her desire to find a mode of writing that would permit a healthier 
            balance between critical distance and passionate personal investment 
            than she was able to achieve while writing <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s 
            Daughter</i>. In that earlier case, too, she had looked to Central European 
            precedents: Wittgenstein’s <i>Tractatus</i> and Johannes Bobrowski’s 
            <i>Levin's Mill: 34 Sentences About My Grandfather</i>. But her topic 
            — “the Nazi Germany into which I was born” — proved to be a “subject 
            so overwhelming, a knot of connections so complex” that these models 
            turned out to be wholly inadequate (ix). She resorted to an improvisational, 
            gap-filled manner of narration that required her to “put [her] trust 
            in language” and concentrate on the “rhythm” of delivery instead of 
            the shape of the work as a whole (xii). While she is satisfied with 
            the results, it nonetheless took her eight frustrating years to bring 
            the novel to completion (ix).</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Konrad Bayer’s <i>Der Kopf des Vitus Bering</i> 
            seems to have offered a tempting, alternative mode of writing: the deployment 
            of collage to create an absorbing narrative without having to agonize 
            over how to put into words one’s deepest thoughts and emotions.<i> </i>The 
            work’s thirty-odd pages recount the adventures of its eponymous hero, 
            the eighteenth-century explorer responsible for charting the waters 
            off Kamchatka and Alaska. Organized into short sections with italicized, 
            headline-like titles, the story consists almost entirely of passages 
            excerpted from other texts, chiefly memoirs, histories, and imaginative 
            literature. (An appendix conscientiously lists every source.) Many of 
            the passages that have been stitched together are digressive, whimsical, 
            or recalcitrantly unrelated to what comes before or after. As Bayer 
            explains in a preface, his goal in assembling <i>Der Kopf </i>was not 
            to produce a faithful reconstruction of actual events and personages. 
            Indeed, Bering the historical figure interests him far less than the 
            opportunities Bering affords for launching into other, juicy subjects: 
            he is “only a location . . . from which to establish relations, like 
            a fisherman casting a net in hopes of catching something” (168).<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>

          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The resulting crazy quilt is openly indebted to 
            pre-World War II European avant-garde practice. Bayer prominently cites 
            the Surrealist André Breton as an authority in his preface, and the 
            texture of its disjointed construction distinctly recalls <i>cadavre 
            exquis</i> (168). Indeed, if one takes Waldrop at her word and reads 
            Bayer in an attempt to understand why it prompted a change in her fundamental 
            method of composition, one can begin to suspect whether this particular 
            collage text ultimately differs enough from its antecedents for its 
            form alone to explain its potent appeal. Other, earlier texts could 
            also have served Waldrop as synecdoches for the ongoing Dada and Surrealist 
            tradition of juxtaposing found materials — for instance, Max Ernst’s 
            <i>La femme 100 têtes</i> and <i>Une semaine de bonté</i>. Well known 
            for her expertise regarding avant-garde French and German literature, 
            she presumably had an array of comparable examples from which to choose.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Der Kopf</i>, I believe, helped catalyze an 
            artistic breakthrough because of its compelling fusion of content — 
            repeated voyages of discovery into the unknown — and form — a serial 
            juxtaposition of prose by different writers. Bayer’s narrative, like 
            Waldrop’s earlier <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i>, is a variant 
            on the old tradition of the quest narrative, and again like <i>The Hanky</i>, 
            the itinerary that the work traces requires that it enter unexplored 
            country. There is one crucial difference, however. Bayer’s text does 
            not mire itself in compulsive authorial self-reflexivity. Agency is 
            distributed among a cohort of writers. Any truths to be found, fostered, 
            or created are a joint, even a communal responsibility.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Decentering “authorship” in this manner is not, 
            of course, the same thing as excluding the personal altogether. Waldrop 
            knew that collage by itself could not prevent autobiographical content 
            from finding its way into <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>. The novel’s 
            prospective theme — the “enormous migration from Europe to America, 
            wave after wave of explorers, conquerors, immigrants” — was too intimately 
            related to her own experience of moving from Germany to the United States, 
            a “change of world” that “surfaces again and again” in her writing (“Between” 
            xv). In addition, she had already learned that, although collage involves 
            recycling others’ words and hence nominally absolves the writer of “authoring” 
            them, self-expression nonetheless stubbornly reinserts itself in the 
            very acts of selecting and arranging one’s found materials:</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=Section1>I had used collage before . . . . I had turned to 
            collage as a way of getting away from writing about my mother. I would 
            take one or two words from every page of a novel, say. The poems were 
            still about my mother. This taught me that one does not need to worry 
            about contents: our preoccupations will get into our writing no matter 
            what. (xvi).<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>

        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For Waldrop, then, <i>Der Kopf des Vitus Bering</i> 
            would not have held out the promise of a straightforward, ecstatic release 
            from either subjectivity or the burden of the past. She would not have 
            been drawn to it because it advertised impossible escapes into the unconscious, 
            surreality, or other, higher, egoless states of consciousness. Rather, 
            she seems to have chosen Bayer’s narrative because it implicitly extols 
            the power of heteroglossia to reframe an author’s contributions as only 
            one aspect of an ongoing, collaborative, intertextual excursion. A casting 
            of the net, a forging of a network of relations.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [10] </span></a> This paradigm for understanding writing as fundamentally 
            intersubjective, processual, and investigative is evident in her comments 
            regarding the indispensability of collage in her writing since <i>A 
            Form / of Taking / It All</i>: </p>

          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In short, <i>Der Kopf des Vitus Bering </i>provided 
            Waldrop with a set of premises regarding language, craft, and literature 
            that permitted her to sublime both the “betweenness” of her dual nationality 
            and the troublesome generic hybridity of her first novel into a potent, 
            persuasive compositional methodology: “An art of separation and fusion, 
            of displacement and connection. For without our connecting them into 
            a picture the dots are not even visible. An art of betweens” (xvii).

          <p align="center">III.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Although in the finished text it appears as the 
            second section of <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>,<i> </i>“A Form 
            of Memory” was in fact the first part to be written, and in it the influence 
            of Konrad Bayer’s <i>Der Kopf des Vitus Bering</i> is at its height 
            (xv-xvi). Most obviously, “A Form of Memory” echoes <i>Der Kopf</i> 
            in its layout, short blocks of prose grouped under such fanciful rubrics 
            as “A Physical Description of Sexual Intercourse,” “Illustration,” “Eyewitness 
            Report,” and “Elegy.” Again as in <i>Der Kopf</i>, its passages all 
            read as if they have been excerpted from disparate other texts. A list 
            of sources that appears at the book’s back confirms this impression, 
            and, like Bayer’s appendix, it seems to be both reliable and comprehensive. 
            Bayer’s precedent permits Waldrop to make drastic alterations in the 
            affect and the style of her prose. In contrast to <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s 
            Daughter </i>— recounted by a mischievously biased narrator in a nominally 
            epistolary format — “A Form of Memory” aspires to a thorough-going impersonality 
            in its manner of construction and presentation. Nowhere in “A Form of 
            Memory” does Waldrop speak <i>propria persona</i>. Assembly-line fashion, 
            we are delivered what can initially appear to be no more than raw boluses 
            of fact, definition, and observation.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Whereas Bayer mitigated the abruptness of this 
            plunge into unadorned collage by providing a preface to explain his 
            methodology and intent, Waldrop opts for another, albeit comparably 
            pedagogical, means of easing a reader into the welter. The opening section 
            of “A Form of Memory, titled “Physical Description of Motion,” self-consciously 
            and gradually establishes the pattern for the remainder of the chapter. 
            Its first four prose blocks serve as a concise introduction to the sorts 
            of materials its readers will be encountering as well as suggesting 
            the kinds of reading skills that they will require in response. Additionally, 
            Waldrop evokes, only then to repudiate, a possible American precedent 
            for her embarkation on a career as a <i>collagiste</i>:</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=Section1>Alexander von Humboldt shipped out on the mail boat 
            “Pizarro” with sextants, quadrants, scales, compasses, telescopes, microscopes, 
            hygrometer, barometer, eudimeter, thermometer, chronometer, magnetometer, 
            a Leiden bottle, <i>lunettes d’épreuves</i> and a botanist, Aimé Bonpland.<br>
            <br>
            Before him, using the newly improved astrolabe to determine the ship's

            “Stress” is used for metrical stress whereas “accent” is reserved for 
            the emphasis demanded by language. (185)</div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The first paragraph’s catalog foreshadows the radically 
            paratactic construction of “A Form of Memory” as a whole. It also alerts 
            readers that are responsible for inferring what connections if any exist 
            among its oddly juxtaposed passages of text. The last item in this catalog, 
            the “botanist,” is a calculated non sequitur, insofar as he is a living 
            being and everything else in the catalog is a non-animate scientific 
            instrument. Waldrop hints broadly that von Humboldt looks upon his traveling 
            companion as just another tool, to be employed dispassionately in the 
            process of scientific inquiry. But she <i>does </i>only hint at it. 
            A reader must take that leap him- or herself.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Odd, paratactic juxtapositions that invite inferential 
            interpretation: at this point, an experienced reader of twentieth-century 
            American literature might reasonably conclude that Waldrop has tacitly 
            declared her allegiance to the tradition of Ezra Pound’s <i>Cantos</i>, 
            which are built throughout on precisely this basis. The next paragraph, 
            the one beginning “Before him,” appears to confirm this intuition. It 
            unexpectedly switches location and dramatis personae, though it retains 
            the same general subject, a maritime journey to the New World. Hugh 
            Kenner, writing about the <i>Cantos</i>, has called this kind of associative 
            leap a “subject rhyme,” that is, a juxtaposition of disparate historical 
            personages that is also an assertion of family resemblance.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [12] </span></a> We are almost certainly supposed to read von Humboldt 
            as a latter-day avatar of Columbus — just as in the <i>Cantos </i>we 
            are to read Eleanor of Aquitaine as a medieval beauty who parallels 
            Helen of Troy, or Mussolini as a munificent patron akin to the Renaissance 
            <i>condottiere</i> Sigismundo Malatesta.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The third and fourth paragraphs of “A Form of Memory” 
            accelerate the vertiginous transitions to new scenes and topics. First, 
            we are given an italicized passage about a cheerful-yet-threatening 
            “mistress” with a “switch,” presumably a teacher of some kind. Then 
            we are supplied with what sounds like a quotation from a textbook on 
            prosodics distinguishing the technical meanings of “stress” and “accent.” 
            These abrupt changes in discursive register again recall Pound’s <i>Cantos</i>, 
            more specifically its ideogrammic method, in which fragmentary verse 
            and found texts are strung together to create cumulative statements 
            about an implied subject matter. The four paragraphs here serve as a 
            Poundian ideogram for “discipline”: scientists, like teachers, arrange 
            and order the world and language, a process that overtly or covertly 
            involves force. Waldrop is reiterating a theme that we have already 
            seen, namely that the European encounter with the New World, even in 
            its outwardly benign guise of the search to discover new knowledge, 
            involves the impulse to “discipline” its unruly otherness.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">So far there is little to distinguish Waldrop’s 
            Bayer-derived compositional method from the paratactic mode of Pound 
            and his progeny. “A Form of Memory” initially seems to position itself 
            as yet another masterful example of post-World War II, post-<i>Cantos 
            </i>prose in the tradition of Charles Olson’s <i>Call Me Ishmael </i>and 
            Susan Howe’s <i>My Emily Dickinson</i>. Waldrop’s first measurable swerve 
            from the Poundian variant of collage occurs in paragraph nine of “Physical 
            Description of Motion”:</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=Section1>Alexander von Humboldt knew that Columbus’s inspiration 
            “from the heart” had been a flock of parrots flying toward the southwest, 
            a word with level stress where the accent falls with equal emphasis 
            on both syllables. Birds, said Alexander von Humboldt. All land his 
            discovered by birds. He lifted his field glasses, but could see nothing 
            but an expanse of water apparently boundless. (185)<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Arial'>&nbsp;</span></div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While remaining within the thematic orbit of the 
            opening paragraphs, this passage does not display the same internal 
            integrity. Yes, “southwest” can be scanned as indicated, but it is extremely 
            difficult to imagine a source text that would interject this piece of 
            information in the midst of reporting von Humboldt’s ruminations on 
            his predecessor. Waldrop has intrusively treated one kind of text — 
            presumably the biography of von Humboldt by Douglas Botting that appears 
            in the “List of Sources” at the book’s back (248) — as an occasion to 
            illustrate the definitions of “stress” and “accent” earlier introduced. 
            While the <i>Cantos</i> do selectively edit, (mis)translate, reconfigure, 
            and otherwise alter their source texts, the deadpan wit here is foreign 
            to the tone of Pound’s epic, which aggressively pursues the <i>directio 
            voluntatis</i>, the thrust of his will, through eons of historical and 
            archaeological evidence.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [13] </span></a> Nor does Waldrop’s impersonal intervention dovetail 
            well with the prophetic posturing common in the prose collages of such 
            Poundian heirs as Olson and Howe. Her cheery digressiveness serves not 
            to overawe a reader with superior, transcendental insight into the timeless 
            order of things but instead to distance him or her, however briefly, 
            from the “discipline” ideogram and to provoke her or him to attend to 
            the limits and assumptions that inform any given act of writing. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">By eschewing the authority of the archivist, Waldrop 
            aligns herself with Bayer, who dismisses any claim that “A mosaic of 
            facts” can “be treated as irrefutable knowledge [<i>gewissheiten</i>].” 
            One must adopt a skeptical attitude, he explains, toward “so-called 
            historical fact [<i>tatsachen</i>]” in the name of “what cannot be proved 
            [<i>überprüfen</i>],” namely, “the sum of possibilities.” He selected 
            Vitus Bering’s story, recorded in scattered and biased records, for 
            his departure point not because he wishes to resurrect a wronged, neglected 
            hero (such as Pound’s Malatesta or Howe’s Anne Hutchinson) but “because 
            [Vitus’s story] leaves things sufficiently open, because it is unclear, 
            because it is contradictory, because one can falsify (or correct) it 
            without losing the historical backdrop” (<i>Der Kopf </i>168). Falsifying, 
            correcting, contradicting, prizing open, obfuscating — these are boldly 
            interventionist activities, hardly evincing the documentary fidelity 
            to the historical record that is the (ostensible) guiding principle 
            of such Poundian, collage-based works as Olson’s <i>Maximus Poems</i>, 
            Howe’s <i>Birth-mark</i>, William Carlos Williams’s <i>Paterson</i>, 
            and Charles Reznikoff’s <i>Testimony</i>. Waldrop, like Bayer, makes 
            the discourses of history subject to open, crass, and ludic manipulation 
            so as to free her readers from their aura of immediate, privileged access 
            to historical truth. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop, in fact, goes a step further than Bayer 
            in this regard. His rhetoric remains transcendentalist in one crucial 
            respect. While evincing scorn for an archival art, his critical attitude 
            toward “so-called historical fact” nonetheless coexists with longing 
            for mystical revelation, an entrance into a temporality in which “past 
            and future . . . are bound into a single point” (168). As far back as 
            1971, in her study <i>Against Language?</i>, Waldrop had registered 
            her distaste for all traces of vatic self-presentation in mid-twentieth-century 
            European avant-garde art — a category to which Bayer unmistakably belongs. 
            In <i>Against Language?</i>, she had argued that the solution is for 
            a writer to redirect a reader’s attention from airy flights of speculation 
            to the nuts and bolts of language’s functioning (122-23).<i> </i>We 
            find this same tactic at work more than a decade later. Waldrop comments 
            that “I flatter myself that [in “A Form of Memory”] I pushed the juxtaposition 
            of heterogeneous materials farther than [Bayer] had, even into the sentence” 
            (“Between” xvi). That last qualification — “even into the sentence” 
            — is no mere throwaway line. Bayer exposes the contingency of the discursive 
            production of history, but he also leaves open the possibility of banishing 
            history altogether as false artifice in order to inhabit a messianic 
            Now. Waldrop, by pushing her inquiry into history further, by operating 
            at the sentence level and below, focuses more narrowly on the <i>language</i> 
            of history. She begins to speculate less about what transcends the historical 
            record than about the rules of selection (semantics) and combination 
            (syntax) by which that record is assembled. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The third grouping in “A Form of Memory,” titled 
            “Physical Description of Motion, Continued,” contains an early, illustrative 
            instance of the splicing internal to a sentence that would soon come 
            to distinguish her variant of collage. First, there appears a statement 
            that reads as if were lifted from an introductory medical textbook: 
            “The action of a muscle is to contract, or to shorten in length, and 
            thus the two structures to which it is attached are brought closer together.” 
            Four prose blocks later occurs a drastically reworked version of the 
            statement: “Metaphor implies a relationship between two terms which 
            are thus brought together in the muscle” (186). Waldrop has hybridized 
            the diction of two disciplines, literary criticism and gross anatomy. 
            She implies that they are comparable, perhaps equally invasive forms 
            of knowledge. Obviously, this connection again relates to the overarching 
            theme “to know = to master.” It also likely accounts for the recurrent 
            interest in ballet in <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>, since dance, 
            as an emphatically embodied art, serves as an analogue for fiction writing, 
            both of them for Waldrop <i>aesthetic </i>modalities of disciplining 
            flesh (of bodies, of language) that stand as alternatives to the more 
            instrumentalized languages of the academy (medicine, poetics).</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">First producing a Pound-like collage-quotation, 
            and then soon afterwards misquoting it, Waldrop provides readers with 
            an object lesson in how collage will operate in her works. She informs 
            them that they will encounter skewed, ill-sutured, and whimsical reinscriptions 
            of other writings. A statement such as “A vast twilight zone, nearly 
            1500 miles wide, was slipping around the earth as the latter turned 
            on its axis” — which first appears in a section titled “Eyewitness Report” 
            in “A Form of Memory” — is liable to reappear without notice in another 
            permutation, whether it be simply paraphrased (“The vast twilight zone 
            slips around the earth as the latter turns on its axis” [226]) or radically 
            reworked in a spliced sentence (“A later meaning of elegy was a poem 
            in whatever meter in which a twilight zone slips around the globe” [190]). 
            These later near-repetitions, in turn, destabilize our confidence in 
            the original statement. Can we trust that Waldrop has indeed lifted 
            it intact from a source in the bibliography, such as von Humboldt’s 
            <i>Kosmos</i> or David Todd’s <i>Professor Todd’s New Astronomy</i>? 
            The Poundian promise of direct treatment of the thing gives way to a 
            discomfiting, Derrida-like display that all citation is always already 
            potentially miscitation.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One need not, though, jump to Derrida or poststructuralism 
            more generally to help us understand Waldrop’s take on collage. Such 
            a rhetorical move would falsely suggest that there is something uniquely 
            “postmodern” about it. Instead, we can return to the technique’s ur-scene, 
            the <i>avant guerre </i>years when Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso 
            first elevated <i>papier collé </i>from a kitschy popular art into a 
            cutting-edge avant-garde strategy for Making It New. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Poundian collage is akin to the newsprint that 
            Picasso frequently pasted to his canvases during Cubism’s founding “analytic” 
            phase. Both Pound’s and Picasso’s incorporations of borrowed text purport 
            to offer a direct, indexical relationship between the artwork and the 
            social world from which these materials have been drawn. The finished 
            poem partakes in the ephemeral and the social with un-literary bluntness. 
            Any attempts to praise it as a hermetic or autonomous text founder on 
            its unlovely incorporation of mundane, often journalistic writing. As 
            Peter Bürger would put it, such collage furthers the avant-garde project 
            of breaking down the baleful distinction between art and “life praxis” 
            that prevails in late capitalism.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            [14] </span></a> </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s version of collage — linked, via Bayer, 
            with a non-Poundian, Continental descent line — also recalls Cubist 
            collage, albeit in a very different manner. It aspires to emulate the 
            <i>whole</i> of a Cubist painting. In the years 1912-13, Picasso typically 
            included not only found materials (chair caning, wallpaper, etc.) but 
            also painted patches, stenciled letters, <i>trompe l’oeil</i> wood grain, 
            and other traces of the artist’s hand. In works such as<b> </b><i>Violon 
            et partition</i>, <i>Tête d'homme au chapeau</i>, and <i>Bouteille et 
            verre sur un guéridon</i>,<i> </i>Picasso seeks not simply to undermine 
            aesthetic autonomy but to issue a radical challenge to a complacent 
            viewer’s presumptions about how painting signifies. He quite literally 
            deconstructs his art, employing shading that does not indicate depth, 
            lines that do not suggest edges, superimposition that does not convey 
            protension, and so forth, as Rosalind Krauss has richly detailed.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
            </span><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>[15] </span></a> The mixture 
            of found objects, <i>faux</i> found objects (wood grain), and free painterly 
            expression functions within this more general semiotic project of reeducating 
            the eye to perceive the conventionality of illusionism, that is, the 
            “painting = window” metaphor fundamental to the art since the Renaissance. 
            Similarly, in “A Form of Memory” Waldrop suggests that her borrowings 
            have nothing naïve about them. She promises to manipulate, violate, 
            cross-cut, and otherwise render their unspoken assumptions overt. Pound’s 
            collage is evidentiary. Waldrop’s is forensic.<span lang=EN-AU

          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After completing “A Form of Memory,” Waldrop proceeded 
            to write the three other sections that make up the remainder of <i>A 
            Form / of Taking / It All</i>. Throughout, she chose to employ as a 
            structural scaffolding a technique internal to “A Form of Memory”: the 
            appearance of quotations that recur in partially or drastically revised 
            forms. She made two changes, however. First, the prose passages in “A 
            Form of Memory” serve as her primary source for this game of repetition 
            and variation. Second, by positioning “A Form of Memory” as Part II, 
            she insures that a reader first encounters these source texts in Part 
            I (“A Form of Vertigo”) in their occulted, spliced forms. As a consequence, 
            Part I is full of unpredictable, fanciful moments that at first refuse 
            easy assimilation into plausible explanatory frames, causal chains, 
            or dramatic scenarios. Much of the narrative’s appeal lies in this uneven, 
            surreal surface. For example, in “Vertigo,” in the midst of a stream-of-consciousness 
            passage, one encounters,</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=Section1>A fork in the road. Henry. What a disaster if they 
            had married. Curing stingray bites by having a prostitute urinate into 
            the wound. It leads to a particularly virulent form of syphilis. Does 
            forgetting count as forgiveness or just being forty, holding her face 
            up to the sun? (162)<span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The thoughts about Henry, marriage, turning forty, 
            and making choices (“fork in the road”) fit the immediate context. Amy 
            Lowell is vacationing in Mexico and musing about the course that her 
            life has taken. The stingrays, prostitutes and syphilis though — these 
            are vivid, intrusive subjects that are less easy to square with the 
            setting and point of view. Is Lowell reaching for a suitable metaphor 
            for the imagined “disaster” wedding? Does she feel prostituted? Diseased? 
            These grotesque metaphors — if they are indeed <i>are</i> metaphors 
            — leave a reader guessing at possible constructions that would accommodate 
            their jolting interruption of the story’s course.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Forty pages later, “A Form of Memory” provides 
            a short passage offering a possible yet oddly tardy answer to the conundrum: 
          </p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=Section1>To cure injuries caused by the sting-ray, you must 
            find a woman willing to strip and urinate into the wound. For the sake 
            of completeness it must be stated that, as there are hardly any women 
            here except peasant prostitutes, this cure more often than not leads 
            to a particularly virulent kind of syphilis. (207)<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;

        </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here we are presented with the bemused, condescending 
            tone of a travel writer presenting, and debunking, a folk remedy for

            [16] </span></a> Perhaps, in the earlier stream of consciousness passage, 
            we witness Lowell’s fleeting, condensed memory of what she had read 
            in this same travel book. Her thoughts about Mexico, as she lies in 
            bed with the shades down, arbitrarily commingle “original” thoughts 
            with words and images that have been lifted from her reading. One is

          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i> gradually takes 
            on the air of a fun house, in which passages recur unexpectedly in new, 
            often distorted guises. Sometimes the changes of context and content 
            provide ambiguously supplementary information, as it does with the stingray 
            cure. Other times the repetition-with-variation estranges the material 
            more drastically. The two narrative sections — Part I, recounted from 
            Lowell’s perspective, and Part III, written first-person from a novelist's 
            viewpoint as she struggles to round off the tale of von Humboldt and 
            Lowell — are pocked with these odd moments. Ada, Lowell’s love interest, 
            is forever being described in stilted, inappropriate terms that “A Form 
            of Memory” makes one suspect have been purloined from Aggrippina Vaganova’s 
            <i>Basic Principles of Ballet</i>. John, Ada’s son, spouts awkward statements 
            about Beethoven and Montezuma that reappear verbatim in Part II. Astronomical 
            and poetological passages from Part II reoccur in the novelist’s stories 
            about Washington, DC. In each of these cases, verisimilitude suffers 
            badly. Would any real person ever spontaneously repeat the bland, fact-choked 
            language of a textbook with such uncanny fidelity?</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Even the most vivid, seeming-profound moments of 
            Waldrop’s story are susceptible to demystification. At the end of Part 
            I, Lowell has a dreamlike vision of herself struggling, physically acrobatically 
            contorting, to escape the burdens and embarrassments of childhood:</p>

            and here is again the ceiling under which childhood waits to be left 
            behind. This is why she must learn to walk on her hands. Two older girls 
            take hold of her legs. Her hair is hanging down to the floor, her skirt 
            falls over her belt down over her neck. Thus, legs high in the air, 
            she walks across the stone floor, a moving island surfacing from the 
            music that has spread all over the ground. Again and again, till the 
            teachers turn away: “Her thighs are too fat,” she hears, “and she already 
            has pubic hair.” (180)<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;

          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A couple of these details will recur prominently 
            in Part II — the parrots (185) and the thundering (193) — but the bare 
            essentials will reappear in a single narrative outtake, again likely 
            derived from Vaganova’s <i>Basic Principles of Ballet</i>:</p>

          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The first iteration of this incident conveys the 
            intense shame involved in the process of publicly disciplining a vulnerable 
            body. One sympathizes acutely, viscerally with Lowell’s discomfort in 
            her own skin. When, however, one comes across another version of the 
            same story twenty pages later, the anecdote ceases to be Lowell’s unique 
            “property.” Now an extract from a textbook, it loses what had been a 
            florid, revelatory particularity. Also, the scene with Lowell had established 
            a set of expectations — about her psychology, biography, place in society 
            — that are thrown into doubt when the same words (“Two older girls,” 
            “hair . . . down to the floor,” “legs high in the air”) pop up again 
            to describe a different-yet-similar action, another girl walking on 
            her hands. We are forced to go back and attend to the specific words 
            and turns of phrase that had given rise to our first, powerful impressions; 
            we thus look anew at the earlier passage with an eye less to its content 
            than to the details of its composition. Recurrence in <i>A Form / of 
            Taking / It All</i> undermines a reader’s faith that fictions, window-like, 
            grants us transparent access to other worlds. We discover repeatedly 
            that a given “window” is in fact a carefully constructed tableaux of 
            words susceptible to artful rearrangement and re-presentation. Collage 
            decisively enters Waldrop’s <i>oeuvre</i> in a work dedicated to rigorously 
            exposing the troubling power relations that inform every act of communication, 
            even (or especially) the act of creating literature.<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>, Waldrop 
            made rapid advances in use of collage. In her hands, the technique has 
            become increasingly supple and expressive, especially as she has gained 
            more confidence in manipulating her found material. At her best, Waldrop 
            is able to keep a reader deliciously off balance, unsure what is original, 
            what borrowed. Incongruity alone is no guarantee that one has encountered 
            a seam between discourses. Indeed, one of her goals in a book such as 
            <i>Reproduction of Profiles</i> is to expose the gaps and slippages 
            <i>within</i> the language of her source texts (in that case, Wittgenstein’s 
            <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>). Although she has had frequent 
            recourse to the metaphor of the palimpsest to describe this vertigo-inducing 
            writerly surface (e.g. “Between” (xvii) and “Form and Discontent” (61)), 
            a better analogy might be a word processor file that consists of cuts, 
            pastes, deletions, and rearrangements of text originating elsewhere. 
            Unlike a palimpsest, such a file would contain no optical indication 
            of depth that would enable an easy sorting out of past and present, 
            original and copy. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A sample of Waldrop’s more recent use of collage 
            can usefully conclude this article by demonstrating the continuities 
            (and discontinuities) in her practice as she moved from writing novels 
            back to her principle vocation, writing verse. I have chosen “Shorter 
            American Memory of Salem,” a piece brief enough to examine in its entirety 
            that also evinces important thematic connections to <i>A Form / of Taking 
            / It All</i>, namely the ugly, murderous power politics involved in 
            the European colonization of North America.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Shorter American Memory</i> (1988), in which 
            “Shorter American Memory of Salem” appears, is a collection of twenty 
            two pieces that, as Waldrop explains on the obverse of the title page, 
            “are derived from sources collected in Henry Beston’s <i>American Memory</i> 
            (New York: Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1937).” Beston’s <i>American Memory</i> 
            turns out to be an anthology of diary entries, letters, court transcripts, 
            official pronouncements, and other historical documents intended to 
            offer a reader “a mirror of the stirring and picturesque past of Americans 
            and the American Nation,” as the title page puts it. In the book’s preface, 
            Beston states the none-too-covert nationalist thesis informing the anthology’s 
            implicit narrative:</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=Section1>From its beginning, American has been writing about 
            itself, and writing well. Indeed, it is not in the literary imitation 
            of European models that American literature has its deepest roots but 
            in the vigorous narrative prose of the native-born generation who left 
            us their seventeenth century accounts of Indian captivity . . . [Using] 
            immediate experience still sharp with emotion wherever I found it, I 
            have put together this memory of the adventure of the Republic, now 
            as then in the making. (xix)<span
  lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In other words, <i>American Memory</i> celebrates 
            “native-born” Americans who are neither Native Americans nor Europeans. 
            It retells their exciting “adventure” in “vigorous prose” so that we, 
            their patriotic descendents, can relish their “memory.” Intent on establishing 
            (white) American identity as the product of racial and national conflict, 
            <i>American Memory</i> devotes the bulk of its attention to subjects 
            such as the colonization of the Eastern seaboard, war with Indian tribes, 
            war with Britain, and the development of a self-sufficient indigenous 
            culture and economy.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In short, the “memory” enshrined in Beston is archival 
            but also highly selective, adjusting the historical record to serve 
            as a record of the trials, tribulations, and victories of a Chosen People. 
            It is also a resolutely middlebrow version of a Poundian “poem including 
            history,” an epic whose protagonists are multiple and whose significant 
            episodes are related by means of juxtaposed extracts from original documents. 
            Beston serves Waldrop as an occasion to renew the historiographical 
            critique so vigorously asserted in <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>. 
            Her abridgement and radical revision of <i>American Memory </i>uses 
            collage to expose the violence — wreaked on people <i>and</i> history 
            — when nationalist-prophets dictate how documents and facts are ordered 
            within an official, shared narrative. When a plurality of memories become 
            one <i>American Memory</i>.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>

            She boils its fourteen pages down to a scant seventeen lines that serve

            [1] was thrown along the house; which the people going to take up, was 
            <b>unaccountably gone</b> [2]. A frying pan then <b>in the chimney</b> 
            [6] rang so loud, that the people at an hundred rods distance heard 
            it; and the said Mary with her husband, going over the river in a canoe, 
            they saw the head of a man, and, about three foot off, <b>the tail of</b> 
            [4] a cat, swimming before the canoe, but <b>no body to join them</b> 
            [5] and the same apparition again followed the canoe when they returned: 
            but at their landing it first disappeared. A stone thrown by an invisible 
            hand after this, <b>caused a swelling and a soreness</b> [3] in her 
            head; and <b>she was</b> [7] bitten on both arms black and blue, and 
            <b>her breast </b>[10] <b>scratched </b>[7]<b> </b>the impression of 
            <b>the teeth</b> [10] which were like a man’s teeth, being seen by many.

        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>, “Shorter 
            American Memory of Salem” freely alters the order and character of the 
            phrases lifted from its source texts. Waldrop changes “caused a swelling 
            and a soreness” to “caused soreness and swelling”; she omits a run of 
            ten words to produce “she was scratched”; and she decides to associate 
            “the teeth” and “her breast,” despite the fact that, as we see in the 
            original, “she was bitten” not on her breast but “on both arms.” Furthermore, 
            in “Shorter American Memory of Salem” she changes the sequence in which 
            the phrases appear. She may preserve a trace of that ordering — observable 
            in the run [1], [2], [6], [4], [5], [3], [7] in which only two elements, 
            [6] and [3], are out of place — but the first phrase chosen from this 
            paragraph ends up in the next-to-last line of the poem. Again we see 
            that Waldrop’s form of collage is unapologetically interventionist and 
            revisionist.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The most dramatic alteration occurs at the level 
            of historical referent. There is no legible trace of Mary, Antonio Hortado, 
            or Cotton Mather in Waldrop’s poem — none of the impedimenta of citation, 
            marginal annotation, and bibliographic description that litter Pound’s 
            <i>Cantos </i>and buttress Beston’s authority. She treats all her sources 
            for this lyric just as cavalierly. Despite the fact that they span several 
            decades and describe many events, including the discovery of sunken 
            Spanish treasure, she distills from them a continuous commentary on 
            a single historical episode, the infamous Salem witch trials of 1692. 
            She insures that the poem will be read in that light by offering us 
            no other proper name than “Salem” itself, a town indelibly associated 
            in American popular culture with the likes of the dastardly Justice 
            Hathorne, the unjustly accused John Proctor, the slave fortune teller 
            Tituba, and the “afflicted” teenagers Mary Warren and Abigail Williams. 
            In her oblique retelling, however, Waldrop offers not Arthur Miller-style 
            realism but an impressionistic, vaguely Gothic (“mysterious,” “apparitions”) 
            catalog of observations. She culls from Beston phrases that evoke, even 
            invoke, a specter that his inclusion of “The Penitence of the Jurors 
            of Salem” cannot lay fully to rest: the American proclivity to use civic 
            and religious zeal as pretexts for killing innocent men and women.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poem’s opening lines introduce the paradoxical 
            imbrication of absence and presence that dominate the piece. The “great 
            stone” in the first line suggests the heavy stones famously used to 
            crush to death Giles Corey, an accused witch who refused to enter a 
            plea. The “great stone” also hints at the weightiness, the imponderability, 
            of the witch trials for subsequent generations of Americans. The poem’s 
            second line — “where unaccountably gone” — suddenly reverses the first 
            line’s assertion of presence, a fact emphasized by the slant rhyme “stone” 
            / “gone.” Has the stone vanished before it could be “counted,” that 
            is, weighed and measured? Or does Waldrop call our attention to “Salem” 
            as a location which combines or juxtaposes the all-too-present (the 
            stone) and the irrevocably lost (that which is “gone”)? The remainder 
            of the poem restates but does not resolve this tension. Suggestions 
            of absence or erasure (“no damage,” “no body,” “no cattle”) jostle with 
            vivid statements about all-too-present, injured female flesh (“a blow 
            to her eye,” “she was scratched,” “teeth on her breast”).</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One could read this dynamic as an oblique commentary 
            on the events surrounding the witch trials: the young girls who based 
            their accusations of witchcraft on mysterious blows from ghostly assailants, 
            the blameless women and men executed for nonexistent injuries to others, 
            the witches’ familiars presumed but never seen, etc. One could also 
            read into the poem a subterranean narrative of domestic abuse. A woman 
            is repeatedly harmed without that harm ever being publicly acknowledged 
            or the perpetrator called to account. She knows her pain intimately 
            (“knowing her own”) but “pious considerations” — whether hers, her abuser’s, 
            or the community’s — prevent that pain from ever becoming fully real, 
            in the sense that it would then become a problem demanding response 
            or recognition from others. In “Shorter American Memory of Salem,” by 
            selectively excerpting, rearranging, and revising the language used 
            by seventeenth century Puritans to talk about their world and their 
            experiences, Waldrop dramatizes the vulnerability, the violence, and 
            the fear that run just beneath its surface. Moreover, she intimates 
            that the “pious considerations” that they espouse not merely oppress 
            but <i>damage</i> women crushed beneath their “great stone.” The anaphora 
            here (“where . . . where . . . where”) distantly but appropriately echoes 
            the use of another interrogative, “who,” as the backbone for the first 
            part of Allen Ginsberg’s <i>Howl </i>(“I have seen the best minds of 
            my generation . . . who . . . who . . . who”). Like Ginsberg, Waldrop 
            laments the wastefulness of history, bringing suffering and loss to 
            the very people a just or civilized society would liberate and celebrate.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This message is not new. We saw Waldrop making 
            much the same point in <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>. But in the 
            few years between that work and <i>Shorter American Memory</i> Waldrop 
            has learned to employ collage with much greater craft. She has ceased 
            to rely upon repetition and variation as a principle of construction. 
            The phrases that appear in “Shorter American Memory of Salem” appear 
            nowhere else in <i>Shorter American Memory</i>. The abrupt jolts and 
            transitions in <i>A Form </i>that lend it the feel of Surrealist <i>cadavre 
            exquis</i> have been replaced by a surface that is simultaneously smoother 
            <i>and</i> more disorienting, insofar as one cannot guess where Waldrop’s 
            contributions end and the found texts in their rawness begin. “Shorter 
            American Memory of Salem” also absorbs, abridges and revises Beston’s 
            anthology with an assurance that permits a greater latitude of tone 
            than <i>A Form</i>. Finally, <i>Shorter American Memory</i> eschews 
            any traces of Poundian parataxis. In place of that giddy form of artifice 
            — dependent on sharp edges and bold transitions, hence a technique well-suited 
            to delivering punchlines and epiphanies — she embraces collage within 
            hypotaxis (“where . . . where . . . where”), an art of relationality 
            that explores nuances of subordination and insubordination, both grammatical 
            and political. <span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;

          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1912 Picasso bequeathed to the avant-garde a 
            mode of collage designed to defeat illusionism in painting. At the turn 
            of the twenty-first century Waldrop provides us with a version capable 
            of exposing a different illusionism, the false authority arrogated when 
            prophets have recourse to “history” to justify their visionary dreams. 
            Again, not a new message. It is one we have heard often in the last 
            hundred years. But the last hundred years have also taught that some 
            messages bear repeating. Waldrop has crafted a form adequate to this 
            content. </p>

            Waldrop recalls that her initial intent in placing “A Form of Memory” 
            second was to set it up as “a fever vision” that Amy Lowell endures 
            while “sick in Mexico.” In other words, Waldrop sought to “normalize” 
            the collage welter of Part II by framing it with Part I’s “interior 
            monologue” (Retallack 375). The particular echo-effect that I detail 
            here may be a trace of this plan. In the book’s final published form, 
            though, the lack, of any transition between Parts I and II, as well 
            as drastic shift in style between them, render it highly unlikely that 
            a reader will consistently read “A Form of Memory” as akin to a medieval 
            dream vision. As I now proceed to explain, the interplay between the 
            first two sections is less stable, more variable, in short, designedly 
            disorienting. </span></p>
