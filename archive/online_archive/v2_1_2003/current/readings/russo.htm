        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Under<i>standing</i>, Rosmarie Waldrop suggests, 
          is one position to take in the struggle to constitute cultural truths. 
          Lying down (refusing the take a stand, lying in wait) is another, one 
          that confounds the logic of position-taking that unifies a system of 
          cultural production based on outward signs of struggle “with all the 
          contradictions it engenders,” but does not gender. The feminine, Waldrop 
          suggests, can enact a different logic (lying down <i>as</i> taking a 
          position, perhaps as a form of protest) and this logic can effect change 
          (as lying down in a path to divert traffic). Inserting a feminine thinking 
          subject into masculine/universal philosophical discourse, Waldrop takes 
          such a position: in writing through work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, diverting 
          and redirecting a prepositional logic by putting down observations and 
          propositions, not in the form of assertions, but passively, shrouded 
          in doubt, as in the question “Would there ever again be ground for walking?” 
          The question cleverly describes a situation while provoking that situation 
          to change.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s writing is rich with what she refers 
          to as “semantic slidings” that conflate textual and social fields, such 
          as this metaphorical elision between “ground for walking” and “the field 
          of understanding.” One does not understand, Waldrop suggests, by lying 
          down (passively, or by giving in or putting out); but because the field 
          does not “extend” there, lying down may be one means of extending ground 
          (a way to recuperate ground that has been lost, to provide new spaces 
          in which to walk). Waldrop begins to reconceive, while accounting for 
          sexual difference, the spaces and structures we have constructed for 
          the processes of understanding (language, grammar) by making the female 
          body and a female desire for knowledge present. The question “Would 
          there ever again be a ground for walking” invokes equally physical and 
          intellectual desires – the desire to move one’s body as well as the 
          desire to ply one’s (embodied) mind against the impositions of understandings.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Her invocation in the epigraph of absent bodies 
          invites us to think of which bodies manifest their presence — take position 
          — in the field of poetic production, and how. And though Bourdieu field 
          model reveals the social dimension of literary context and points out 
          the constantly constructed “space of positions and the space of position-takings”(30) 
          he can not account, as he claims to do, for the “full reality”(36) of 
          texts, because what his model reveals is only partial: it doesn’t account 
          for sexual difference. Gender is not considered one of the “visible 
          interactions between individuals”(29). The “sexual indifference” (Irigaray 
          1985, 72) of his theory serves as proof that maleness in cultural production 
          is a primary effect of this field. Gender remains an invisible interaction; 
          and women appear to simply fail to participate in the struggles that 
          constitute the field<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [1] </span></a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But we know that to be untrue. And we might read 
          the work of women poets as revealing gender to be an effect in poetic 
          production: in Joanne Kyger’s and Alice Notley’s explorations of the 
          epic; in Susan Howe’s remantling of space, time and women’s voices; 
          in Lyn Hejinian’s and Waldrop’s rejections of certainty and closure 
          — the list goes on, but the point is that gender is not a “lens” one 
          may as easily choose not to look through, it is a material fact in determining 
          one’s relation to language, knowledge, power. The new forms and language 
          that such poets create suggests that they are aware of some unexamined 
          presuppositions that constitute — and limit — poetry as a means of articulating 
          a relationship to the world. The idea of poetic possibility, of experiment 
          — Bourdieu also refers to the field of production as the <i>field of 
          possibles </i>— relies on the provisionality, the fluidity, of the field’s 
          constitutive rules, and on the introduction of forces that necessitate 
          change. Waldrop’s long-time work as printer, co-editor and co-publisher 
          of Burning Deck has been to apply consistent pressure to conventional 
          understandings of poetry by encouraging and enabling experimentation. 
          And her poetry is a good place for thinking about poetics, bodies, knowledges, 
          experiment and change. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s work addresses “the field of understanding” 
          as such, a field which ascribes limits to our understanding (and from 
          which we create perceptual models like Bourdieu’s). She encourages us 
          to participate in a semantic struggle where language, as a tool of description, 
          is in flux — in <i>The Reproduction of Profiles</i> this is the ‘ordinary 
          language’ that Wittgenstein attempts to describe in the series of language-games 
          that constitute <i>Philosophical Investigations.</i> like Wittgenstein, 
          she enables us to imagine a process of wonder rather than logical certainty 
          and closure. Her work belongs to the field of position-takings. It engenders 
          contradiction and prizes conflict and struggle. We as readers wrestle 
          with potential meanings, engaging with her in a dance of the intellect. 
          Open forms avoid finality; her work is “reader-centered” in the sense 
          that it opens a dialogue that continues because — she cites Jabès — 
          “Only the reader is real”(1991, 36). </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And the ‘real’ reader in <i>The Reproduction of 
          Profiles </i>is the female I in a text composed of series of prose passages 
          that engage the knowledge of a masculine ‘you.’ Despite his certainty 
          the I remains in uncertainty, undecided, even capricious in her resistance 
          to clarity — classically feminine traits that disarm a desire to close 
          with logical conclusions. The I explores, tries to understand, thinks, 
          is not certain, believes, learns, wonders, knows but can not articulate, 
          looks, tries to hear, tries to get facts down, hopes, gets confused 
          — to offer a concordance of verbs that occur in the second section of 
          <i>Reproduction</i>, “Inserting the Mirror.”  Sentences often open with 
          propositions “If I” and “As if”, and it is in the same spirit — of asking 
          questions rather than looking for conclusion — that we must engage with 
          this text. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Reproduction</i> reveals the struggle for meaning 
          that is constituted through the body and its desires in a confrontation 
          with logical certainty. She takes Olson’s metaphorical sense of the 
          “skin” as “the meeting edge of man and external reality”(Olson, 161) 
          as a site of intersection, interaction, and one-ness between I and world 
          — a figure through which Olson does away with the division between internal 
          reality (logic, the ordering principal) and external reality — and adds 
          her awareness of “libido and language”(1991, 35). She sensualizes the 
          interaction in a way that Olson felt incapable of doing. In “Human Universe” 
          he contrasts this sense of his body to the Mayan “natural law of Flesh,” 
          in which “there is none of that pull-away which, in the States, causes 
          a man for all the years of his life the deepest sort of questioning 
          of the rights of himself to the wild reachings of his own organism”(158). 
          Waldrop, in opening her poetic form to the body and its desires fully 
          claims that right – that is, to let her organisms (and orgasms) “reach” 
          (and also <i>teach</i>) — and, further, gives the “law of Flesh” (and 
          the uncertainty which Olson alludes to) equal footing with the certainty 
          and authority of logic. The sentences in the prose passages that compose 
          <i>Reproduction</i> proceed as they do because desire in its certainties 
          and uncertainties is as persuasive (it mounts an argument) and determining 
          as the certainty of logic. The extent to which the “wild reachings” 
          of desire “open” form to unpredetermined destinations (the path or road 
          is a pervasive image in Waldrop’s work) contrasts sharply to logic’s 
          “impulse to make order and continuity” (1991, 35), as Waldrop has put 
          it. Surely one must first be able to see the value of impulsive logic 
          before one can appreciate the logic of desire. What this amounts to 
          is what I want to refer to as Waldrop’s Poetics of Inflection. </p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Language shapes and so guides perceptions, making 
        them uniform through commonly held rules such as syntax and grammar. But 
        in limiting the field, do they obscure visibility and put us in a fog, 
        or enable clarity through providing focus?<i> </i>This line of questioning 
        impels Wittgenstein’s <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, his attempt 
        to (serially) describe the use of language — to clarify it: description, 
        not explanation, he contends, is the job of philosophy. Waldrop’s poetics 
        of inflection shows that we must reconsider the logic of our own representations, 
        or the “profiles” (images, outlines, data) we construct in language, and, 
        more particularly, in poetry. Her remarkably complex title <i>The Reproduction 
        of Profiles</i> manages to invoke both printed words and images. While 
        “profile” signifies a visual contour, the word also defines a textual 
        “contour,” a form of information based on analysis, data representing 
        individual exhibits, traits or abilities upon which conclusions are drawn 
        — and the visual representation of this in a graph or “a curve.” Here, 
        also, Olson’s notion of the page as “field” is inflected: it is not only 
        visual, but, as in longer works by some of Waldrop’s contemporaries<i> 
        </i>conceptual as well.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
        [2</span><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>] </span></a> This accumulation 
        of text in a book-length field of understanding that supercedes the page 
        creates a conceptual field (writ large, Olson would say) so that dominant 
        notions (logics of syntax and semantics) that determine poetry are pushed 
        to <i>its</i> margins. This feminist poetic doesn’t consist of writing 
        “in” or “from” the margins, but of the creation of new margins in a reorganization 
        of significance and insignificance. </p>

      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In posing this question Waldrop suggests that she’s 
        going to subvert the logic of sentences: in comparing the sentence to 
        a road, she suggests her method: a sentence is a material phenomenon. 
        Words don’t merely refer, they do things. Questioning the nature of the 
        sentence is a provocation as well as a challenge: What is the “it” that 
        sentences “do”? Does a sentence state facts that lead us tour conclusions? 
        Does a sentence have a destination? Can’t we then choose whether to follow 
        its lead or not? How is the sentence’s logic of connection (syntax) different 
        from the logic of walking? This vexatious comparison follows the sentence 
        not to its conclusion, which disappears like a road meeting horizon, but 
        dissolves conclusion, creating instead a multitude of conceptual roads 
        to travel. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The series of prose poems in <i>The Reproduction 
        of Profiles </i>— I’ll call them “passages” to emphasize the connections 
        Waldrop makes between writing and traversing<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
        [3] </span></a> — are concerned with the act of perceiving and describing 
        in a language that Waldrop liberally inhabits as Wittgenstein’s, quoting 
        or turning a phrase, misquoting, following of phrase to its logical or 
        illogical conclusions, in order to, as Waldrop has written, “try to subvert 
        the certainty and authority of logic through the body and its desires” 
        by addressing “the <i>closure</i> of the propositional sentence”(HOW(<i>ever</i>) 
        Vol.4.2, n.p.). Inflecting the deductive logic of linearity, her lines 
        lead us elsewhere, outside of logical reasoning, to reveal how these limit 
        our potential to understand ourselves and the world. Each quasi-narrative 
        passage constantly slips from the “setting” that its narrative logic attempts 
        to establish, so that these work against conventions while using them: 
        there is a protagonist (the narrating I), setting (often composed of elements 
        of a landscape: rain, clouds, trees), and linear continuity (suggested 
        often by uneasy proposition and conclusions). They are internal dialogues 
        in which the female I ruminates upon (and perhaps misremembers or misrepresents) 
        the words of her male interlocutor. What she recalls (without sentimentality) 
        are scenes of instruction, and in her articulation of the exchange the 
        authority of his knowledge is put to the test of the authority of her 
        memory, curiosity and desire: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>You said once we had a language in which everything was alright, everything 
          would be alright, and your body looked beautiful while a fisherman tied 
          his boat to a post, looping his rope through the metal rings without 
          getting entangled in problems of representation or reflection. (34)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Such slippages are the mode of assemblage in these 
        prose passage, suggesting that we don’t know whether it is language or 
        the misuse of it that shapes experience into coherent, narrative forms. 
        It is this sense that comes through in the fluidity and elasticity of 
        meaning in these poems. She has written about her focus on language in 
        this way: “because the writer, male or female, is only one partner . . 
        . Language, in its full range, is the other” (1998, 611). One senses the 
        joy that goes into inflecting meaning, in never letting the poem rest 
        (which is perhaps why these are prose poems rather than end-stopped; these 
        lines take no “breaks”). </p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Changes in language and in spatial perception are 
        at play in Waldrop’s poetry, which occupies language and its fields of 
        perception in order to consistently provide a new and challenging set 
        of inflections. These play out on the level of syntax (the poetic line 
        or the sentence) which extends from a series of dialogues between the 
        text’s two subjects on the concepts that compose the philosophical system 
        under investigation (Wittgenstein’s), by inserting her “other” point of 
        view (one informed by cultural position as female, as inhabiting a body 
        with particular desires) the female subject proposes a new set of perceptions, 
        a new set of “truths” unforeseen by, and even unaccountable according 
        to, the discourse to which she is addressed.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It’s difficult to choose one poem to read closely 
        — all are rich and seductive in their linguistic textures and suggestions 
        — and even more difficult to follow up on the multitude of inflections. 
        To read one poem in isolation belies the series in which language is constantly 
        recycled, and it’s impossible to convey the effect of reading these poems, 
        a process punctuated by textual déjà vu, the sense that what you have 
        just read was encountered previously, an effect that reinforces an experience 
        of language as phenomenal and material. Upon investigation, however, this 
        sense of re-experience isn’t corroborated. There was no “profile” reproduced, 
        but one sent instead through many inflections. This begs the question 
        of why we expect repetition rather than change. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Within sentences and from sentence to sentence, “that 
        which is the case” changes perpetually, an effect that comes to Waldrop 
        perhaps through her native, highly-inflected language, German, where, 
        as in Latin, word order is much less rigid than it is in English, and 
        where syntax is such that a clause that appears at the close of a sentence 
        can change the meaning of the sentence as a whole.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
        [4] </span></a> The result of the inflections in <i>Reproduction</i> is 
        a dual perceptual complexity: on the one hand, the sense of a sentence 
        changes (bends or curves, or “slides”) so that its meaning is redirected; 
        we who were “following” the sentence must change our path. On the other 
        hand, ambiguity clouds the relation between perceiving subject and objects 
        perceived. Both kinds of inflection are evident here in the third passage 
        of “Inserting the Mirror”: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>  Androgynous instinct is one kind of complexity, another <br>
          is, for example, a group of men crowding into a bar while their<br>
          umbrellas protect them against the neon light falling. How bent<br>
          their backs are, I thought. They know it is useless to look up —<br>
          as if the dusk could balance both a glass and a horizon — or to<br>
          wonder if the verb “to sleep” is active or passive. When a name<br>
          has detached itself, its object, ungraspable like everyday life,<br>
          spills over. A solution not ready to be taken home, splashing<br>
          heat through our bodies and decimal points.        (59)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Under the sort of pressure Waldrop’s experiments 
        exert on the linear logic of prose construction, words become variables 
        (rather than absolutes) — and we read them variably. In an apparent contrast 
        here between an abstraction (an instinct) and a phenomenon (a group of 
        men walking into a bar) the latter becomes abstracted as an example of 
        gender instinct as well: a group of men adhering to a gender identity 
        construed through a shared trait — this particular use of umbrellas (which 
        suggests the arbitrariness of gender characteristics!). This gesture is 
        in turn made strange: why do they need umbrellas to protect them against 
        neon? “Inserting the Mirror” begins as an investigation of rain; isn’t 
        it that condition which presupposes the use of these men’s umbrellas? 
        But women, singly or in groups, use umbrellas the same way? But why do 
        we not see women with umbrellas? Because they are included under the umbrella 
        term “man”? Isn’t it obvious that though androgyny — a blending of gender 
        characteristics — is “one kind of complexity,” men with umbrellas is “another” 
        kind of complexity altogether, having nothing to do with gender? (But 
        how can a group of men not have to do with gender?). Grammatical relief 
        is the fact that there is no contrast here — an analysis which relies 
        on categorization — the sentences aren’t “doing” that — but there’s contiguity, 
        the beginning of a series of kinds of complexities. Yet we are lead down 
        the paths of contrast nonetheless. Finally, what’s so complex about this 
        particular male group phenomenon? The complexity lays in the understanding 
        we as readers form, the extent to which language bends and causes uneasiness 
        and uncertainty, and reveals our reliance on the logic that determines 
        and conventionalizes modes of representation for a sense of stability. 
        For while this passage narrates an event, another event is the series 
        of inflections, a chain of associations that stems from this chain of 
        signifiers. Because there are umbrellas we assume it is raining, but we 
        only know for certain that there is neon. The apparent simplicity of a 
        truth like “umbrellas protect one from rain” is revealed to be inadequate 
        as an explanation of what umbrellas “do” and more appropriately a description 
        of what we use them for: Wittgenstein would agree, and with Waldrop would 
        ask, “what do we use language for?” </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In these passages and through their strangeness, 
        inflection is an alternate logic of coherence. Through inflection, associations 
        in narrative and images are drawn both from passage to passage (rain, 
        heat) and within them (bar, glass, spill, splashing, solution). There 
        are points of grammatical bending, transitions points, such as the parallelism 
        in the first sentence, the interjection of the I’s thought formulated 
        to include a consistent pronoun reference (“Their backs . . . they know”), 
        the conjunction “or,” the temporal marker “when” — all this staves off 
        an arbitrariness that would suggest this is merely a collection of sentences 
        and not a “poem” — countering such a suggestion is precisely the challenge 
        these “prose poems” accept. Inflection is a means through which Waldrop 
        searches “for the fine line between closure and openness, where there 
        is closure, but not too much, so that [the writing is] still alive”(1991, 
        36). </p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Water, rain, puddles — such images become 
        figures for “the life of the mind” as it is shaped by available forms. 
        <i>The Reproduction of Profiles</i> is one attempt to create a new method 
        of form. As Waldrop’s poetic language bends and shapes perception, it 
        asks us to question the shapes in which we’ve conceived the world, harkening 
        back to the classic philosophic scene — Plato’s cave. This bending and 
        shaping, this keeping thought alive, is a refusal to settle into forms 
        as a prior authority. Her language wriggles away, flirtatious, leading 
        us by our desire to know, taking us “by the hand”: “what any good poet 
        does is listening to the words and letting them take over and take us 
        by the hand, taking us in unforeseen directions, stretching our original 
        ideas, which can always stand to be stretched”(1991, 30).</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            The title <i>The Reproduction of Profiles</i> 
        suggests the method by which inflection replaces reflection as a mode 
        of perception. In the cover image [insert jpeg of cover image], the profile 
        of a classical Greek statue is reproduced, not to effect an identical 
        copy but an alternate image, one reflected slightly “bent,” at a slight 
        angle in the round surface of a hand mirror. Mirroring the left side of 
        the statue’s face effects a second right side view (it is a reproduced 
        profile of <i>both</i> left and right: the left by reflection, the right 
        by mimesis) in this Man Ray photograph where a logic of identification 
        is askew: right and left are not opposites, and right isn’t self-identical. 
        Slight modulations in the physiognomy are discernible; in the mirror image 
        curves of eyelid, nose, or lip suggest a difference of character: where 
        the statue is somewhat wistful, its reflection is more firm and focused. 
        The triangulated compilation of objects invites further speculation: the 
        sense of psychical interiority drawn out in this object/image contrast 
        is echoed in the curvaceous light bulb and light shade — the shade like 
        a womb protecting in its concavity the brain-child — which inflect dually 
        the notion of illumination as sexual <i>and</i> intellectual: a notion 
        that, in 1913, fascinated H.D.. In her feminine poetics <i>Notes on Thought 
        and Vision</i>, H.D. redesigns female reproductive physiology (to combat 
        perhaps a Victorian sensibility that found the womb so problematic and 
        mysterious) as a <i>thought</i> productive physiology: “Should we be able 
        to think with the womb and feel with the brain? . . . The brain and the 
        womb are both centres of consciousness, equally important”(20-21). The 
        intellectual womb: in place of an organ “hidden” from vision, a “love-mind” 
        and a “lens” that contributes to the picture — the perceptions — of the 
        brain. The mind/matter paradigm is subverted. </p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><img src="images/Russo.jpg" width="200" height="312"></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bringing the body and its desires to bear on logical 
        propositions, Waldrop’s inflective poetics are a further development of 
        some concepts that provoked H.D., transecting her modernist subversion 
        with a language that contradicts her binaristic logic by sliding over 
        the constitutive conceptual boundaries. Mind and matter are no longer 
        opposed when the boundary between interiority and exteriority — between 
        the I perceiving and the world of objects — is removed. The “I” in these 
        passages is experiential, in the world, refusing to take a position outside 
        of it (from which to establish truths, Wittgenstein asserts). Inflection 
        results in part because there is no subjective certainty in Waldrop’s 
        poetry from which to test whether certain assertions about the truth of 
        reality succeed or fail: there are only perceptual differences. Writing 
        in <i>The Reproduction of Profiles</i> is the act of creating a series 
        of contexts where the challenge of articulating new possibles, new realities, 
        new connections materializes in an otherwise “derealized” world (Bourdieu, 
        32). They inhabit reality in very much the way Bourdieu hoped to show 
        texts do, as a social reality, a realm of exchanges (and difficulties) 
        between people variously positioned, as her emphatically gendered pair 
        do.</p>

          Waldrop, <i>The Reproduction of Profiles </i>(60)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The second section of <i>The Reproduction of Profiles</i>, 
        “Inserting the Mirror,” stresses that inflection, rather than reflection 
        — the mirror does not work on the basis of mimesis — is the text’s modus 
        operandi. What Marjorie Perloff terms “a mock causality,” a form that 
        “determines Waldrop’s syntax [and] marks a notable departure from the 
        syntactic norms of modernist and, for that matter, postmodernist poetic 
        sequences”(209), is also a form of what Luce Irigaray describes as mimicry 
        with a difference, which allows women to speak as women, “to try to recover 
        the place of her exploitation by discourse . . . to resubmit herself . 
        . . in particular to ideas about herself, that are elaborated in/by masculine 
        logic, but so as to make ‘visible,’ by an effect of playful repetition, 
        what was supposed to remain invisible: the cover-up of a possible operation 
        of the feminine in language”(Irigaray 1985, 76). Women are not simply 
        “resorbed” in the act of mimicry. One must “assume the feminine role deliberately” 
        and the artifice this proposes keeps women from being reabsorbed into 
        phallocratic discourse (Irigaray 1985, 76). In Waldrop this is effected 
        by her characteristically <i>feminine</i> role as subordinate, posing 
        questions, tenuous observations and “faulty” propositions. Though these 
        appear naïve, they are never innocent; they are pedagogical, intended 
        to prod, provoke and enliven, and they foreground the uncertainty that 
        lies behind all assertions, the uncertainty that the proposition is meant, 
        if only momentarily, to hide.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The act of repetition — “repeating mine over and 
        over” — will not produce sameness. The image in the mirror is not the 
        equal of the one who gazes, as one’s name does not in any essential way 
        reflect who one is. Words don’t attach to objects (a point Waldrop makes 
        in this text in several places) except by a logic of identification, and 
        even then they only relate or adhere. And, to be sure, that the “I” stares 
        at her reflection is an assumption that the phrase invites but by no means 
        substantiates. This gazing may also reveal all that is “not I” if the 
        line of sight is inflected by the mirror and the gaze is directed toward 
        another point. We must try to understand this sentence, which is itself 
        an assertion of an attempt at understanding, as we find ourselves caught 
        between two images the sentence produces — two truths: the obvious one, 
        reflection, or the less obvious but equally plausible, inflection. One 
        substantiates the law of self-identity (according to Aristotle, A = A): 
        the face of the namer = the reflection of the named; the other asserts 
        that  Aristotle’s law of excluded middle (everything is either A or –A) 
        relies entirely on perspective and therefore can’t be universally true. 
        The way words in this phrase miss — fail to positively identify, or provide 
        a representation — is as important as language’s capacity to “hit.” Here 
        we see both sides of the coin at once, neither of which can we take at 
        face value. And yet words don’t lie; as Waldrop challenges in <i>Lawn 
        of Excluded Middle</i> “As if a word should be counted a lie for all its 
        misses”(51). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As “Inserting the Mirror” begins it is clear that 
        language can’t provide an accurate image of the world: “To explore the 
        nature of rain I opened the door because inside the workings of language 
        clear vision is impossible.” This is a simple assertion — one can’t ‘see’ 
        rain in language, it doesn’t happen <i>in</i> language but in the experiential 
        world. The assertion is also rich and suggestive: when one opens the door, 
        is it to step out into the rain? To step out of “the workings of language”? 
        Does one need a “clear vision” of rain — to <i>see </i>it — in order to 
        explore its nature? Does language privilege the sense of sight, only to 
        fail to supply adequate vision? Don’t other senses provide information 
        as well? The next line “You think you see, but are only running your finger 
        through pubic hair” confounds the senses. Perhaps you are using language 
        to “feel” rather than to “see” — to get a sense of, rather than to understand. 
        The sense of touch is very much attuned to contiguities, as when surfaces 
        change (running hands through public hair to approach skin or to approach 
        gender-specific organs), but it is the sense of sight that we privilege 
        as a metaphor for understanding. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The mode of perception that Waldrop constructs is 
        sensual (in both senses of the word). At the skin, feeling and touching 
        are ways of thinking. I don’t feel the rain only; I feel myself get wet, 
        and that is how I know the rain. The utter realism of her language serves 
        to deflate its metaphoric potential, which, as Waldrop shows, obscures 
        rather than clarifies: “I expected the drops to strike my skin like a 
        keyboard. But I only got wet”(57). Is the rain like a keyboard or is the 
        skin? Or both? Or neither — rain does not strike skin like a keyboard. 
        Raindrops make skin wet. Or is the wetness an effect of running fingers 
        through pubic hair? Through this act of inflection, Waldrop explores language’s 
        elasticity, its ability to misrepresent or obscure the world in relation 
        to the persistence of the desiring body in constructing our experience. 
        It is the feminine body, that is, that causes the inflection in phallocratic 
        discourse: inflection is the effect of the language of certainty encountering 
        the materiality of the body and its desires. One can be neither live wholly 
        in language nor give over wholly to the world, but must be amidst both. 
        This is why, perhaps, Waldrop so frequently phrases by means of proposition, 
        an “As if” (disconnecting the “if” from the “then,” cause from result) 
        which is also a challenge, a way to avoid certainty, to keep meaning at 
        play, to imagine a space of possible results, refusing to assign <i>one</i>: 
        “As if one could come into language as into a room”(60). Inflecting Wittgenstein’s 
        descriptive method creates a text that addresses us in so many questions. 
        Despite the fact that they are not posed as questions, our response is 
        invoked, and we are called upon to defend our assumptions, our truths.

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Inserting the Mirror II</i></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The phrase “inserting the mirror” corresponds to 
        a particular historical moment which involved inserting an actual mirror 
        to extend one’s view, as a consciousness-raising tactic. The mirror served 
        to allow women to claim themselves as sexual beings while countering the 
        reproduction pornographically of images of their bodies (and thus definitions 
        of female sexual desire) for male consumption. To appropriate (and feminize) 
        the male pornographic gaze was to confound its power, the singularity 
        of its defining potential. It was also to begin to unravel in women’s 
        terms the “mystique” that had determined much of women’s sexual — that 
        is to say, reproductive — lives. This inflection of the phrase “inserting 
        the mirror” concurs with a history of ideas about mind and body.  To place 
        Waldrop’s conceptual mirror — which reveals assumptions rather than truths 
        — next to these actual mirrors from a time when the overarching feminist 
        struggle was to render from their own perspective women’s voices and images, 
        is to suggest that though as epistemological methods they differ greatly, 
        they are contiguous projects, having in common the development of female 
        intellection and understanding. Waldrop’s extended poetic project is unabashedly 
        intellectual in this sense. Confronting philosophy, classically the realm 
        of masculine intellection, in a sexualized textual space, Waldrop manages 
        to depart from feminist concerns that are more typically given voice. 
        Her notion of “inserting the mirror” stands in contradiction to the mimetic 
        poetic strategies of feminist “re-vision”; her act of insertion and the 
        elasticity of her language belie the production of static images indicative 
        of the “snapshot” school of feminist poetry. Waldrop’s inflective poetics 
        refocuses “a difference of view” toward a view of differences, one that 
        addresses problems of representation and agency as inherent to the way 
        we use language to shape our world while illustrating how language, as 
        a tool of perception, can be made to bend. Her feminist inflection is 
        thus as powerful as her grammatical and philosophical inflection; all 
        three work together to deform traditional figures of the feminine, to 
        trace a departure, a swerve from well-trod pathways. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s entry into philosophical discourse is through 
        the texts of Wittgenstein, who theorized for the 20<sup>th</sup> century’s 
        the role of language in constituting the world. Hers is more than an “investigation,” 
        a term that has come to describe the feminist work of many contemporary 
        experimental poets, but a formal instigation. It literalizes the mode 
        of investigation (to hypothesize, question, explore, etc.) with its complex 
        use of the question, which in Waldrop’s text is a “softened,” “feminized” 
        form of assertion, that rather than provoking defensiveness invites contribution. 
        It works in a dialogic mode, bringing the discourse of philosophy into 
        a dialogue which plays out on two levels: between the I of the text who 
        asserts herself through persistent questioning and the you held accountable 
        as the representative of the subject of philosophical discourse, “man”; 
        and between the non-subject (or object) of philosophy, a woman whose body 
        and desires when “inserted” (like the mirror) into philosophical discourse 
        inflect, bend, and, in their redirection, open the primary mode of philosophical 
        discourse, the proposition aimed at establishing certainty. As a dialogue 
        it increases uncertainty by a factor of two. As Irigaray writes of her 
        investigative method in <i>Speculum of the Other Woman</i>, “what is important 
        is to disconcert the staging of representation according to <i>exclusively</i> 
        ‘masculine’ parameters”(Irigaray 1985, 68). Much is uncertain in this 
        text not because Waldrop’s “new proposition” refuses to adhere to the 
        logic of old, but because by establishing her place within philosophical 
        discourse, Waldrop (and the I of the text) begins to deprive “man” of 
        his certain place which she, through “her” silence, had formally constituted 
        <i>for</i> him. But her entry is studied, and her carefully <i>staged 
        </i>question-assertions are an attempt to modify and not simply disrupt 
        logic, to direct it toward other, unforeseen directions: if the synthesis 
        enacted by this dialogic form is productive of conceptual and perceptual 
        change philosophy might begin to produce new truths about subjects and 
        the world. As Irigaray writes, “it is indeed precisely philosophical discourse 
        that we have to challenge, and <i>disrupt</i>, inasmuch as this discourse 
        sets forth the law from all others, inasmuch as it constitutes the discourse 
        on discourse”( Irigaray 1985, 74).<i> </i>Waldrop’s dialogic also ensures 
        that the subjects are not the product of the “sexual indifference” that 
        traditionally defines philosophical discourse. By recounting a heterosexual 
        philosophical dialogue under the authority o the inscribing feminine I, 
        Waldrop demands that philosophy (and poetry) become accountable for sexual 
        difference, to recognize the fact that the world is composed of two distinct 
        subjects whose needs won’t be covered under the umbrella term “man.” This 
        effect, this particular change, would not be possible without the insertion 
        of the female subject into this discourse, not to substantiate (or reflect) 
        the truths established there, but to inflect them. </p>

              Concepts that are essential to Bourdieu’s theory of avant-garde 
          literary and artistic production have long been put to use in literary 
          criticism, and very recently his “field” has been taken up with particular 
          interest by scholars of poetry at the 2002 Twentieth Century Literature 
          Conference in Louisville, Kentucky, where three speakers (Robert Archambeau, 
          David Kellogg, and Libbie Rifkin) each proposed models of how possibilities 
          are shaped in the field of postmodern poetic production, addressing 
          in particular how notions of the self and factors such as publication 
          and the archive help form poetic identity, how the poet’s relation to 
          these factors determine the field and, subsequently, “position” them 
          “in” the field. The poets who served to people these models were all 
          male.</span></p>
