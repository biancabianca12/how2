        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">by Alison J. Van Nyhuis</P>
        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P><blockquote>
        <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
         <p class="DOUBLESPACE"> [This paper was delivered at the Marxist Reading Group Conference 2002,  “Refusing 
    Our Way of Life: Praxis for a Radical Present,” University of Florida.] </p> 
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Glancing at book jackets and websites of recently published 
      literary anthologies reveals new-equals-inherently-improved rhetoric. The 
      book jacket of Cary Nelson's <i>Anthology of Modern American Poetry </i>(2000)<i> 
      </i>even boasts its &quot;comprehensiveness&quot; quantitatively. It &quot;contains 
      over 750 poems by 161 American poets” with &quot;numerous poems by women, 
      minority, and progressive writers only rediscovered in the past decades.&quot;  
      But its selections enraged and continue to enrage many.  In a 2000 review 
      of the <i>Anthology of Modern American Poetry, </i>for example, Marjorie Perloff 
      argues that Nelson selects poems &quot;as exemplars of specific racial, ethnic, 
      and political groupings and generally as proponents of a radical politics&quot; 
      (207). She singles out Genevieve Taggard--a white, middle-class poet who writes 
      during the 1930s--as one such &quot;exemplar&quot; and seriously asks, “Why 
      is Genevieve Taggard in the anthology?” (211).  Her review suggests the answer: 
      Nelson includes Taggard because of her political involvement during the &quot;red-decade&quot; 
      of the 1930s and her poems’ radical, leftist content. Taggard fits in Nelson's 
      radical and &quot;instructive&quot; poetic narrative, but, Perloff argues, 
      her poetry does not deserve to be in the anthology.  If Taggard's poetry is 
      just &quot;plain bad writing&quot; on leftist political topics, as Perloff 
      asserts (210), how can we explain the consistent appearance of Taggard's work 
      in literary anthologies from the 1920s until today ?   And since multiple 
      anthologies have included Taggard's poetry, why have so few contemporary scholars 
      commented on her work?  Answers to these questions seem to lie in a process 
      I would like to call the reproduction of anthological literary narratives, 
      meaning that anthology editors' organizing motifs or narratives amplify particular 
      strains of Taggard's own career.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Tracing Taggard's anthological repositionings throughout 
      the past seven decades foregrounds rival cultural narratives of literary modernism: 
      1920s versus 1930s. The 1920s narrative, found in traditional anthologies, 
      privileges aesthetics, alienation, innovation, and revelation while the 1930s 
      narrative, found in alternative anthologies, privileges leftist political 
      politics, unity, and revolution. In this essay, &quot;traditional anthology&quot; 
      refers to such anthologies as Louis Untermeyer's <i>Modern American Poetry 
      &amp; Modern British Poetry </i>(1962) that primarily strive to construct 
      a survey of &quot;the foundational authors&quot; supported by many canon-formation 
      proponents, and &quot;alternative anthology&quot; refers to more recent anthologies 
      such as Cary Nelson's <i>Anthology of Modern American Poetry </i>(2000)<i> 
      </i>that strive to present a more inclusive literary narrative by recovering 
      or including previously repressed and excluded poets and poetry (Kaloustian 
      15).  Due to Taggard's leftist political ties and protest poems, it might 
      initially seem that she is exactly the kind of poet who would benefit from 
      alternative anthologies like Nelson's that avidly work at opening up anthological 
      spaces in order to construct a more inclusive poetic narrative; however, tracing 
      editors’ repositionings of Taggard’s poetry within traditional <i>and </i>alternative 
      anthologies troubles both of these anthologies' effects and literary narratives. 
      The anthologies' reproduction of rival 1920s versus 1930s literary modernisms 
      contains Taggard in their anthological margins. Exploring canonical/anthological 
      obstacles faced by revolutionary writers like Taggard could help combat the 
      reproduction of reductive anthological spaces.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The cycle of Taggard's literary repression begins with 
      literary reviews. Initially, Taggard's contemporaries praised her verse, but 
      praise quickly turned to character assassination when she began publishing 
      poems with more explicit political themes. In a 1926 review of <i>Words for 
      the Chisel </i>(1926), a collection of poetry published by Taggard, Allen 
      Tate echoes previous reviewers' praise and adds even more accolades by claiming 
      that she writes &quot;consistently better&quot; than &quot;her contemporaries 
      because she crafts &quot;intelligently sustained,&quot; &quot;economical,&quot; 
      verse &quot;in clean, essential outlines&quot; (45). As Taggard writes less 
      lyrical poetry on nature and love and writes more protest poems on class, 
      gender, and race, reviewers write increasingly more unsympathetic critiques 
      of her work. One <i>Time </i>review describes Taggard's poetry &quot;as the 
      work of a 'worried, earnest, political nondescript'&quot; (qtd. in McCann 
      378).  Later reviewers' repression of Taggard's protest poetry starts positioning 
      her as a poetic misfit, and traditional <i>and </i>alternative anthologies 
      have consistently reproduced Taggard's misfit position by repressing substantial 
      portions of her life and work.         </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Most traditional anthologies foreground her lyrical poetry 
      but repress her political associations and protest poetry. Only one of the 
      traditional anthologies I examined mentioned Taggard by name in its preface--Louis 
      Untermeyer's <i>Modern American Poetry &amp; Modern British Poetry</i> (1962), 
      and he only mentions Taggard briefly in the &quot;New Lyricst&quot; section: 
      &quot;Genevieve Taggard and Jean Starr Untermeyer lifted the ordinary round 
      of woman's everyday into the extraordinary and, not seldom, into the ecstatic&quot; 
      (27). The word “ordinary&quot; suggests Taggard lives within and works from 
      a private, domestic realm and negates much of Taggard's political involvement. 
      The words “extraordinary” and &quot;ecstatic&quot; tag Taggard as a lyrical 
      poet. Although Untermeyer explicitly positions Taggard as an “everyday,” “private,” 
      “individual,” “female&quot; poet who personally and subjectively writes about 
      her experiences, other traditional anthology editors reposition Taggard within 
      their respective 1920s literary narrative--but contain her in their margins.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And they reposition her liberally: no poem appears in 
      more than two traditional anthologies. Only one poem, “The Enamel Girl,” overlaps 
      between the three anthologies published before the 1970s.  In effect, these 
      shifting poetic selections recodify Taggard. As opposed to Untermeyer, who 
      positions Taggard as a minor lyrical poet, Thomas Carruth, the editor of <i>The 
      Voice that is Great Within Us: American Poetry of the Twentieth Century</i> 
      (1970) calls Taggard “metaphysically and traditionally oriented” in his headnote 
      (191). Carruth's “metaphysical” tag directly contradicts Untermeyer, who situates 
      her poetry in opposition to other metaphysical poets.  But Carruth's “traditional” 
      tag could function as an extension of Untermeyer’s “ordinary” and &quot;New 
      Lyricist&quot; descriptors.  Since Carruth does not specify how and in what 
      tradition Taggard’s poetry is “traditional,” it seems rather difficult to 
      fix the term’s meaning. Possibly in response to these vague and possibly competing 
      poetic positionings, the <i>Survey of American Poetry </i>(1986) only prints 
      poems found in Untermeyer's and Carruth's anthologies. Instead of sifting 
      through and rejecting past descriptors, the anthology unites them, and Taggard 
      emerges from the twentieth century as a &quot;(new)lyricist,&quot; &quot;traditional,&quot; 
      <i>and </i>&quot;metaphysical&quot; poet.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But this united recodification suggests Taggard’s poetry 
      does not apply to or will not be understood by the masses. The lyric is  traditionally 
      regarded as representing personal, individual experiences that do not necessarily 
      represent group experiences, and its fragmented, disruptive, self-reflexive 
      aspects often complicate readers’ “understanding” of the poetic message--if 
      one exists. Foregrounding her lyrical and metaphysical writing represses her 
      more explicitly &quot;political&quot; poems. Privileging the aesthetics, alienation, 
      formal innovation, and personal revelation of Taggard's earlier writing represses 
      a substantial portion of her verse and separates her from the communities 
      she worked in and for. </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Alternative anthologies, such as Nina Baym’s <i>Norton 
      Anthology of American Literature</i> (1998)<i> </i>and Nelson’s <i>Anthology 
      of Modern American Poetry</i> (2000), move Taggard further away from the anthological 
      border positions held in traditional anthologies by privileging what the traditional 
      anthologies repressed--Taggard's leftist poetry.  In the anthology’s preface, 
      Nelson presents Taggard as one of the most important poets writing during 
      the 1930s, which he foregrounds as one of the most important poetic decades 
      in the twentieth century. Then he uses his poetic selections to emphasize 
      Taggard’s political roles. &quot;Everyday Alchemy,&quot; &quot;Up State-Depression 
      Summer,&quot; and &quot;Mill Town&quot; highlight the harmful effects of class 
      inequalities (336-339). &quot;Ode in Time of Crisis&quot; and &quot;To the 
      Negro People&quot; prompt the laboring masses to unite and rise up against 
      hegemonic forces (339-42). The poem printed last, &quot;To the Veterans of 
      the Abraham Lincoln Brigade,&quot; challenges readers to analytically reconsider 
      their present “peaceful” situation (342). In contrast to the traditional anthology 
      editors' selections, Nelson’s selections suggest that Taggard primarily writes 
      about class, gender, and race (in that order) to induce political activism 
      and cause social change: the poems and their subject matter function as a 
      means to a higher, political end. Baym does mention one of Taggard's earliest 
      lyrical collections that addresses love, marriage, and nature, <i>For Eager 
      Lovers </i>(1922), but both Nelson and Baym reposition Taggard as a political 
      poet first and foremost, solidly grouping her with other female, radical, 
      leftist poets; however, this misrepresents Taggard’s self-positionings in 
      essays, articles, and literary works. She more clearly aligns herself with 
      men <i>and </i>women in class more than gender struggles. By foregrounding 
      Taggard’s historical situatedness and political associations, alternative 
      anthologies do reintroduce important information that traditional anthologies 
      have repressed for decades. In doing so, they almost eclipse her formally 
      innovative, critically acclaimed 1920s lyrical and metaphysical work. </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Reading “With Child,” one of Taggard's most representative 
      poems, within a 1920s <i>and </i>1930s literary context shows how both rival 
      literary narratives might prompt limited readings of Taggard’s poetry. “With 
      Child&quot; begins as follows:</p>
    <P>                       Now I am slow and placid, fond of sun,<br>
                           Like a sleek beast, or a worn one, <br>
                           No slim and languid girl—not glad<br>
                           With the windy trip I once had,<br>
                           But velvet-footed, musing of my own,<br>
                         Torpid, mellow, stupid as a stone.  (<i>Collected Poems 
      </i>20)</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In a traditional 
      anthological context like Untermeyer’s, readers might be more apt to focus 
      on the self-deprecating remarks voiced in the poem’s opening lines since Taggard’s 
      other poems in Untermeyer’s anthology echo those remarks. Within this context, 
      readers might conclude that the speaker simply discusses a mother’s “natural&quot; 
      and “ordinary” relationship with her child in the remainder of the poem; other 
      poems near “With Child” also mention mothers and/or nurturing. Reading the 
      same poem in an alternative anthology like Nelson’s might elicit slightly 
      different responses. Nelson’s poetic selections present women as powerful, 
      social activists rather than “everyday,” private, individuals. In Nelson's 
      anthology readers might experience the language of the speaker as that of  
      a powerful creator, a poet. In that same vein, people might read the poem’s 
      concluding lines more self-reflexively: </p>
    <P>                                                              In the dark <br>
                           Defiant even now, it tugs and moans <br>
                         To be untangled from these mother's bones. </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Instead of reading the poem as a speaker strictly narrating a literal struggle between mother 
      and child, readers might conclude that the poem also wrestles with a poet's 
      relationship to her poem, or product, considering Nelson’s class-conscious 
      context. The position of “With Child” within rival poetic narratives prompts 
      alternative readings that legitimize anthology editors’ poetic repositionings 
      of Taggard but also reproduces limited readings of Taggard's poetry. A richer 
      context could facilitate a more layered reading.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After developing a better understanding of how editors' 
      revisionist 1920s and 1930s literary narratives repress crucial aspects of 
      Taggard's person, poetry, and politics, literary scholars should continue 
      working to locate the “Genevieve Taggard effect&quot;--the marginalization 
      of poets or the production of canonical/poetic misfits <i>because </i>their 
      body of work does not squarely rest on either side of a literary divide. Once 
      located, scholars should examine and eventually deconstruct the literary narratives 
      that produce limited readings in order to produce a transformative anthological 
      space that would produce more informed readings of poets and their work. </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Taggard’s own self-positionings offer a more complete 
      anthological representation. She positions herself as an impassioned artist 
      concerned with poetic form and expression, as well as a political activist 
      concerned with using her individual voice and experiences to benefit and unite 
      others. In the introduction to <i>May Days</i>, Taggard writes, the &quot;artist's 
      concern is not to persuade or educate, but to overpoweringly express&quot; 
      (14). Shortly thereafter, she states, “The working class needs artists.” Taggard 
      does not separate her more personal, lyrical poems from her more social poetry 
      as anthology editors have done. She also presents herself as more poetically 
      innovative than others have positioned her. In an introductory statement to 
      <i>Ten Introductions </i>(1934)<i>, </i>a collection of modern verse that 
      Taggard co-edited and published, Taggard “humbly” repositions herself as a 
      progenitor of innovative poetry. She writes, &quot;our purpose has been simply 
      to indicate possible fresh sources of poetry” (5). It logically follows that 
      “simply indicating fresh sources of poetry” will generate more profound effects--more 
      “fresh,” innovative poetry. Although Taggard writes fresh, innovative poetry, 
      anthology editors repress her most innovative poetry, as will be shown by 
      examining &quot;This Poem&quot; (<i>Slow Music </i>9, 1946). Even though her 
      leftist political involvement and poetic content generated negative poetic 
      critiques, she continued cultivating and communicating her political positions. 
      In a 1942 interview Taggard says, “At the end of college, I called myself 
      a Socialist in a rather vague way. Since then I have always been left of center” 
      (qtd. in McCann 377). When she publishes <i>Falcon: Poems on Soviet Themes 
      </i>(1942) she<i> </i>dedicates it to Liudmilla Pavlichenko, a Soviet war 
      hero (<i>Repression and Recovery </i>260). Curiously, (note the sarcasm) <i>The 
      Dictionary of Literary Biography </i>(1978) lists 
      seventeen of Taggard's major publications but neglects to list <i>Falcon</i><i>. 
      </i>Taggard describes the “social poetry” found in <i>Falcon</i> and many 
      other sources as emphasizing “the struggles of labor, the sufferings of the 
      city and country poor, and the part of the humane middle-class person&quot; 
      (qtd. in Salzman and Zanderer 330). In addition to foregrounding the grossly 
      repressive elements of traditional and alternative anthologies, this brief 
      overview of Taggard’s own words and projects shows how scholars might conceptualize 
      the deconstruction of rival literary narratives in order to produce a more 
      complete presentation of Taggard‘s poetry. This could prompt people like Marjorie 
      Perloff to reread Taggard’s poetry as more aesthetically, politically, historically, 
      and culturally valuable. </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“This Poem” (1944), one of Taggard’s poems neither included 
      in traditional nor alternative anthologies, suggests that scholars should 
      look beyond previously anthologized poetry when constructing anthologies. 
      Excluding “This Poem” enables traditional and alternative anthology editors 
      to downplay her verse’s innovative slant.  The poem’s concluding lines, “This 
      is Tuesday morning; and we, the multitude / Fresco the wall of the sky into 
      which we fade” turn the modernist structure on its head by uniting its audience 
      instead of alienating it.  The poem functions as the modernist verse outlined 
      in Baym's “American Literature between the Wars, 1914-1945” introduction (911-21)<i>. 
      </i>It uses fragments; it shifts voice, perspective, and tone; it uses symbols; 
      it searches for meaning; it uses the poem as subject matter. Inserting “This 
      Poem” in traditional or alternative anthologies would disrupt their narratives 
      of Taggard’s poetry. It would also enable the anthologies to more accurately 
      convey Taggard’s poetically innovative work. Taggard’s shift from the modernist 
      tradition of alienating the audience to uniting it positions her as a poetically 
      and socially powerful disruptor of a disruptive form.    </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rephrasing Perloff’s question, “Why is Genevieve Taggard 
      in this anthology?, might be more important than answering it. This essay 
      offers many answers explaining why editors include Taggard in their anthologies. 
      But instead of continuing to ask, “Why is she there?” it might be better to 
      ask, “How does her presence there affect our readings of her?” Asking how 
      and why editors do what they do will help readers better understand how to 
      more effectively respond to the literature editors choose to present, as well 
      as the literature they repress.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Contemporary scholars occupy prime positions to critique 
      the limiting effects of anthological spaces in order to produce a transformative 
      anthological space. Our turn-of-the-century position enables us to look back 
      and assess how others have “packaged” twentieth-century poets within anthological 
      narratives.  When we begin to look back and evaluate anthologies' representations 
      of poets we should think about a poet's entire career, and about the poet's 
      own narrative rather than imposing our own discursive confections on a poet's 
      work.</p>
            <p class="DOUBLESPACE"> <em>I would like to thank Marsha Bryant for 
              &quot;introducing&quot; me to Genevieve Taggard, inspiring me to consider 
              how she has been represented in anthologies, and also reading and 
              perceptively commenting on this essay.  </em></p>
