          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>The impulse to write about Rosmarie Waldrop’s 
            work came before my censoring mind could stop me. It came from a bubbling 
            up of appreciation and admiration for work which has inspired me for 
            many years. But, in the end, all my efforts at finding a way to write 
            “about” Waldrop’s work met with nothing but resistance. I wanted to 
            explore this resistance within myself. After reading Rosmarie Waldrop’s 
            “Meditation On Certainty,” I took a few notes.</i> </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>MEDITATION ON CERTAINTY</b> </p>

        <blockquote> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>The more a proposition hardens its glassy simplicity 
            tilts all fluids away from the body, all thoughts into sudden white. 
            A paralyzing excess of focus, and you know you'll never marry.</b> <i></i></div> 
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><em>I want to write about the humor, sense of playfulness, 
          openness and experimentation in Rosmarie Waldrop’s work. I want to write 
          about her signature use of the fragmented “I” which gives me the sense 
          that I am standing inside the words themselves. It is clear to me as I 
          think of these things that “what” I “think” of Rosmarie Waldrop’s work 
          is not a “what” or a “process of thinking” at all. I am made increasingly 
          aware of how the gaps in Rosmarie Waldrop’s descriptions seem to hover 
          over some unnamed edge which forces me to stop thinking for seconds at 
          a time and brings a sense of wholeness in the reading itself. I sit down 
          and try to describe this. At turns I feel I am getting too analytical, 
          then too intellectual, then it seems I am becoming too mystical, too abstract, 
          and then, in the end, too ridiculous.</em></p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>I map out the linear arguments I have invented 
          for myself. I try to stay within the margins I have created. I feel stressed 
          by the need for logic and intellectual epiphanies. The magic of poetry 
          leaves me. </i></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Certainly so cold in the knees the words faint, 
            amputated. The wood dries, the door starts creaking, the darkroom is 
            opened too soon. It is the lowest point gathers. A host on the tip of 
            the tongue equals worse than any pied piper.</b> </p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>I argue with myself. My focus keeps getting narrowed. 
          My arguments feel artificial, disrespectful in their assumptions. I feel 
          I am a fraud. Rosmarie Waldrop’s work itself is other than all of my accumulated 
          descriptions. Her writing is a teetering between inside and outside, between 
          comprehension and mystery. I put everything aside hoping I will find clarity 
          when I return to this project in a week or so.</i> </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>The house as if you could draw your character 
            from it, incest of immobility and sedentary adventure, breath sealed 
            by sediment of ghosts. So inferred, daylight trickles from a high window 
            the larger the absence of puddles on the floor.</b> </p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>I re-read my notes on Rosmarie Waldrop’s work. 
          I see that while she offers possibility, I offer conjecture. I realize 
          everything I have written is about “me” defending my invented position. 
          I cannot do this. What I love about Rosmarie Waldrop’s work is that she 
          allows misunderstanding, she offers herself the freedom for that. </i></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>The eye both hungry and </b></p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>In consistencies in every proposition. I have 
          enslaved myself because to write “about” is to limit the experience “of.” 
          By defining her work I feel I am narrowing my sense of it. Who do I think 
          I am and why would I do this? I am not an intellectual or an academic. 
          I am that nebulous, insistent thing, “a fan.”</i> </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>This wider lens restores confusion, fingerprints 
            and weeds. Relations alter. Not just the river, the bed, too, shifts. 
            Your mother takes a lover. Slow oscillation of lips, as between hide 
            and seek, magnetic and field. Speeds red without limit through tree 
            tops, leaves flowing through veins.</b> </p>

          her of this problem I have. Then I decide not to. </i></p>

          <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Hour of glass, pillar of salt. The words come 
            to their senses. It is the lowest point gathers love. Doubt, sometimes
