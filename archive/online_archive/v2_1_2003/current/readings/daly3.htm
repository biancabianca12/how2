        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P><blockquote>
        <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
         <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Hawaiian Hilltop</i>, a small pamphlet of poems 
      published as first in a series of pamphlets by Wyckoff and Gelber, contains 
      seventeen poems by Genevieve Taggard.  These poems, about her experience as 
      a child and young teenager living in Hawaii with her missionary parents at 
      the turn of the century until the beginning of World War I, contain themes 
      and concerns she would return to again and again over the course of her brief 
      career.  Since her Hawaiian experience was unusual, her poems and memoir pieces 
      about her childhood were very salable.  In addition to this group of poems 
      published a year after her 1922 first book, <i>For Eager Lovers</i>, she included 
      memoir materials regarding Hawaii, Washington State, and Vermont in the preface 
      to her <i>Calling Western Union</i>, her most political work, and in <i>Origin:  
      Hawaii</i>, one of her last books.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Hawaiian Hilltop</i> begins as problematically 
      as does Genevieve Taggard’s first book, <i>For Eager Lovers</i>:  with a poem 
      with masculine rhyme and very strong iambic.  This first poem is the title 
      poem.  Taggard begins it by referring to classical Greece and Rome.  It is 
      very common to compare the California coast, where Taggard was living during 
      the period this pamphlet was published, to the Mediterranean.  It is not a 
      commonplace to compare Hawaii to Greece and Italy.  Together with its opening 
      reference, the form of the poem (tetrameter quatrains rhyming abab) seems 
      intended to provide a “classic” aura to this poem.  The poem’s content is 
      the expression of the timeless qualities of nature in the tropics:  shadows 
      and hills are the same as in Greece and Rome, leaves and pebbles are the same 
      as in Egypt, dust and insects are the same as in ancient Babylon.  In the 
      closing quatrain of “Hawaiian Hilltop,” she contrasts this timelessness to 
      narrative or history about male authority:</p>
    <P>                        Men chipped as messages in stone,<br>
                             The careful stories of their kings –<br>
                             But they were dumb about their own<br>
                             Undying things!</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The tropical and eternal cycle of nature is feminized 
      by this opposition.  This is quite unusual:  Taggard does not describe nature 
      using “female” terms; she describes an insufficient and specifically male 
      authority which is in a binary relationship with nature.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Nature also becomes non-narrative through this opposition:  
      “stories” are “careful”; nature is not.  Stories can only attempt to be lasting, 
      but they are “dumb”:  they ultimately remain silent.  Ironically, then, this 
      poem by one of the founding editors of a journal entitled <i>Measure</i> seems, 
      eighty years later, like nothing so much as an unnatural, careful, and contingent 
      story carved in stone.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When Taggard wrote a preface to a longer collection 
      of Hawaii poems, <i>Origin:  Hawaii</i>, she compared bees in Hawaii to bees 
      in the Mediterranean again, “the bees in our algaroba trees made the same 
      sound that Virgil imitated in the Latin text.”  As in the title poem of <i>Hawaiian 
      Hilltop</i>, she emphasizes the way in which, despite her early isolation, 
      she has obtained a particularly fine Western education.  She demonstrates 
      that she has understood the tropics of her youth through her readings of canonical 
      literature.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the second poem of the sequence, “Bronze Boy,” 
      Taggard clarifies that animals in nature are outside of time.  In a sense, 
      the fish in this poem are not individuals nor “races” in the same way humans 
      are:  “fish” will outlive the boy’s “race”:</p>
    <P>                         By these dim fishes, that will dart 
      and glide<br>
                             When you and your flame-bodied race 
      have died.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Yet, for mothers and a “maiden” in poems on the 
      second and third pages, “Tropic Mother’s Melody,” “Kanaka Mother-Goose,” and 
      “Native Daphne,” palms, flamingoes, and fishes are entertainments and ornaments, 
      rather than persistent truths.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Native Daphne” continues Taggard’s extended comparison 
      of the world that classical mythology describes with the landscape of the 
      islands.  Daphne is the first love of Apollo in Ovid.  “Native Daphne” is 
      addressed to a boyish “you,” “If you would love a maiden….” This “you” is 
      not a man, since men in this poem are unfavorable, are thieves, “Lest men 
      should spoil her… / (Men … go as guilty thieves).”  “Native Daphne” is followed 
      by “Solar Myth,” which relates a Hawaiian sun myth.  The Maui story is that 
      of a son seeking to please a mother by adjusting the rapidity of the sun’s 
      movement across the sky:  it is much different than the Apollo story.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While poems such as “Native Daphne,” “Child Tropics,” 
      and the final poem in the sequence, “Tourist,” are sensual, and written from 
      a male point of view, other poems, such as “Tropic Mother’s Melody,” are clearly 
      intended to be read aloud to children.  This peculiar combination of modes 
      and intended audience is also found in <i>For Eager Lovers</i>, the book Taggard 
      published a year before this pamphlet.  Both books are intended to serve an 
      audience of Taggard’s peers – young mothers and male poets – who might be 
      reading poetry for pleasure or to give pleasure.  Poems like “Solar Myth” 
      speak to both audiences.  The myth is not retold for adults, as are many contemporary 
      retellings of myths and fairy tales in poetry.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Each time Taggard would return to her memories of 
      Hawaii that <i>Hawaiian Hilltop</i> represents, she corrected her views and 
      statements to match the political tenor of the time she wrote, and her current 
      place in it.  She continued to filter her experience through relatively approved, 
      and western, ways of seeing it.  While the romanticized “brown” and “bronze” 
      people in the pamphlet become “the reality of racial suffering” in later poems, 
      nature, approved texts, and benevolent governance remained her source of abundance.
