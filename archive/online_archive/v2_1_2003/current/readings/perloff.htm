        Small Periplus along an Edge”: <br>
        Rosmarie Waldrop's Auto-Graphs&#148;</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="CENTER">by Marjorie Perloff</P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rosmarie Waldrop was born in the Bavarian town of 
        Kitzingen am Main in 1935, the youngest daughter (her twin sisters were 
        born eight years earlier) of Josef and Friedericke Sebald. Her father, 
        by her own account in <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i>,<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
        [1] </span></a> was a staunch Nazi; indeed he joined the Party in 1932 
        before membership became mandatory (HPD 122). Commentators have referred 
        rather euphemistically to “Waldrop spend[ing] her childhood and adolescence 
        in Nazi and postwar Germany,” or “Waldrop encountering the restrictions 
        of German Nationalism and the Nazi regime,”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
        [2] </span></a>as if the Sebalds were no more than passive German citizens, 
        swept along by the Hitler tide, but, if the many allusions in Waldrop’s 
        writings are to be believed, her parents and their friends were active 
        Nazis, and thus what the poet perceived to be her dark past made it imperative 
        for her to find a poetic form that would be “a way of getting out of myself. 
        Into what? An interaction with language and other writings. Relation rather 
        than substance. Whitehead’s ‘occurrences,’ Olson’s ‘between.’” But, having 
        voiced this credo, and having cited, approvingly, Roland Barthes’s proposition 
        that “Writing is the destruction of every voice, of every point of origin 
        . . . the negative where all identity is lost,” Waldrop adds ruefully, 
        “But the collages are still about my mother!”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
        [3] </span></a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In life, Rosmarie Sebald did find a way of getting 
        out of herself — or rather, out of her oppressive and stifling childhood 
        world — as soon as she could. At the University of Würzburg, where she 
        enrolled to study Comparative Literature in 1954, she met an American 
        GI named Keith Waldrop, who soon became her husband. They moved on to 
        France and then to the U.S., where Rosmarie Waldrop got a PhD in 1966 
        with a thesis called <i>Against Language</i>. It seems a beautiful coincidence 
        that the city in which the Waldrops settled and lived most of their lives, 
        running the Burning Deck Press, teaching, and producing so many important 
        books of poetry, fiction, and translation, is called <i>Providence</i>. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Allusions to Waldrop’s childhood and family come 
        up in many of her works, but there are two texts specifically concerned 
        with her family’s Nazi past: <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> of 
        1986 and, ten years later, the title sequence of <i>Split Infinites</i>”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
        [4] </span></a>The latter is, I believe, one of Waldrop’s masterpieces, 
        and I shall turn to it in a moment. But first some reflections on the 
        novel <i>Hanky</i>, so named because, as Waldrop explains in her introduction, 
        “Between, Always,” to the new edition:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>. . . my title refers to the legend of how my hometown, Kitzingen am 
          Main, was founded. Around 750, the time of the Merovingians. The daughter 
          of Pippin the short dropped a handkerchief from the castle window. The 
          wind carried it down the mountainside to the Main River, where shepherd 
          Kitz found it. The town of Kitzingen was built on the spot. All a bit 
          unlikely. But what interests me in this story is that a whole life is 
          reduced to one single gesture. Nothing else is told about this woman. 
          Not even her name: “Pippin’s daughter” (HPD xiv). </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The explanation as to how Kitzingen got its name 
        seems about as plausible to Waldrop as are most of the “events” she narrates. 
        As she tells Joan Retallack in an important interview:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Any attempt to understand is a construction, and a violence. Keeping 
          that in mind, especially when the subject involves something as horrible 
          as the Holocaust, even if you only touch on the fringes, how can one 
          pretend to “understand”? And at the same time, I needed to get at some 
          of the things, to understand, or imagine, how people like my parents 
          lived through that time, to what extent they went along. That is the 
          wound of this book. To know that I have come out of this. Trying to 
          deal with origins in this nasty framework. (CJR 341).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is an awesome task. To deal with the “wound of 
        this book,” Waldrop produced a sardonic, often bitterly comic narrative 
        about Josef and Frederika, the ill-matched couple, whose sex life is bad 
        from the start. Frederika is soon having an affair with Josef’s World 
        War I army buddy Franz Huber, who is Jewish, and it may thus be that Franz 
        was the real father of the poet’s twin sisters, named, for the ocean liner, 
        Andrea and Doria. The Jewish affair, Waldrop tells Retallack, is her own 
        invention. But Waldrop’s political vignettes and dialogues, which are, 
        only partially invented, are largely written in the style of documentary 
        realism. Short interludes are introduced by captions or headlines, in 
        the manner of Joyce’s <i>Aeolus</i> chapter in <i>Ulysses</i> or Dos Passos’s 
        <em>U.S.A.</em> For example:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>DO YOU NEED ME TO REMIND YOU THAT THE NAZIS GAINED 
          VOTES?&nbsp;</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          “They’ll be in the next election.”</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          “They’ll get the country on its feet again. Strong government,<span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> </span>that’s what we need.”</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          “But they’re hoods.”</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          “Don’t be a child. Anybody in power takes care of his enemies. And at 
          least they’re on the side of the little man, for a change. Not Barons 
          and Junkers. Socialists.”</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          “You forget the National. It comes before Socialist.”</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          “What’s wrong with National? Better than the commies.” (HPD 119).</div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These topical dialogues are juxtaposed to dream 
          sequences, in which Josef and Frederika express, in hallucinatory form, 
          their sexual fears and hatreds. As the “story” progresses — and there 
          is, despite the fragmentation and dislocation of the narrative, a definite 
          temporal progression from the couple’s marriage to the postwar — a postwar 
          in which “Franz Huber was never mentioned. Neither was the word ‘Jew’” 
          (HPD 151) — Josef and Frederika are shown as creatures of the narrator’s 
          withering scorn. There is a measure of sympathy for Josef, wounded in 
          the war and retreating, finally, into his study so as to avoid his wife’s 
          endless recriminations (“A heap of scrap metal built up in the middle 
          of the Seifert living room”), but Frederika emerges as almost hopelessly 
          cold, self-involved, and manipulative. Waldrop pulls no punches: she 
          seems to <i>hate</i> her mother. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The Josef-Frederika narrative intersects with a 
          second, contemporary one, which is told in the form of letters to and 
          conversations with the narrator’s sister Andrea. We never hear Andrea’s 
          voice directly, but the narrator alternately argues with her, teases 
          her, informs her of key facts and considerations, and confides in her. 
          It seems the narrator herself has had an affair with a man named Laff, 
          which has caused great problems between herself and her husband Bob. 
          And Andrea has gone from the chastity of the convent to a life of sleeping 
          around, whereas evidently the second twin, who plays no real role here, 
          is married with five children but has had an affair with a man named 
          Uwe. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The implication is that the narrator is trying 
          to understand her own story by understanding the related stories of 
          her mother and sisters, but, on the whole, these epistolary sequences 
          strike me as much less interesting than the third-person narrative, 
          with its shifting voices, which Waldrop handles with great finesse. 
          Here, for example, is Josef responding to the arrival of the twins:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>But twins. A double scar. This is where the trouble 
          starts, thought Josef. &nbsp;</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          This he had not counted on. This double was not ethereal. Too much matter. 
          There was to be time before you, Andrea, before a second child. If there 
          was to be a second. Frederika had overdone it. Always to extremes. She 
          could have controlled herself. He could not control his worry. Tried 
          to run up estimates on raising two girls. (HPD 55).</div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here the first four sentences belong to Josef, 
          but “This double was not ethereal,” seems to be the narrator’s own ironic 
          comment, and in sentence 7, she addresses Andrea as if it is she who 
          is inventing the possible thoughts drifting through her father’s mind 
          at such a moment. Then voice shifts again and finally, we are back in 
          Josef’s own mind: “Tried to run up estimates on raising two girls.” 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In her interview, Joan Retallack talks about the 
          novel’s “epistemology of incompleteness,” its emphasis on “the limits 
          of knowing” (RR 341). Here Retallack seems to be following Waldrop’s 
          own lead: “What more is there to add?” asks the narrator on the penultimate 
          page of <i>Hanky</i>. “No resolution. A dissonant suspension with always 
          the beginning of new motions, nervous twitch, clash of opposing tensions 
          holding together like the stresses of a building” (HPD151). Such phrases 
          as “dissonant suspension” and “epistemology of incompleteness” apply 
          nicely to many of Waldrop’s texts, but I’m not so sure that they describe 
          accurately what happens in <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i>, whose 
          principals — Josef and Frederika — are caricatured so mercilessly that 
          there is hardly more than one way of thinking about them. True, we are 
          given alternative explanations of Frederika’s taking up with Franz (Josef’s 
          clumsiness in bed? Frederika’s vanity? And so on), but whatever her 
          motive, there is no question but that she is a nasty woman or that Josef 
          is as mean-spirited and narrow as he is intellectually limited. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Any telling,” says Waldrop, “is a falsification, 
          is doing violence” (RR 343). One must, she insists, not impose one’s 
          perspective on the material. But in this case, the prescription proved 
          to be almost impossible because Waldrop was so close to the situation. 
          One senses that she has never forgiven her mother or even tried to think 
          of possible extenuating circumstances for her way of being. The invention 
          of the Jewish lover can thus be seen as a palliative: if Frederika had 
          actually given herself emotionally and passionately to a Jew, the reasoning 
          goes, perhaps she was not so bad after all. But the invention of Franz 
          has a <i>deus ex machina</i> quality: one never quite believes that 
          someone who behaves or thinks as Frederika does would allow herself 
          to sleep with a Jew, much less pursue him; nor do I think Josef would 
          have remained friends with his Jewish World War I army buddy for so 
          many years. Supposedly, it is music-making that brings Frederika (the 
          Seiferts were then living in Bayreuth) and Franz together, but here 
          the narrative can’t quite avoid the cliché of the gifted musical Jew. 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“I feel,” says Waldrop in her Introduction to the 
          second edition of <i>Hanky</i>, “a strong affinity to this word ‘between’”: 
          “BETWEEN, ALWAYS. Between father and mother. Between memory and conjecture. 
          Between English with a German accent and ‘For an American your German 
          is excellent’” (HPD vii). And in her essay “Alarms &amp; Excursions,” 
          Waldrop tells us that, “To my mind writing has to do with uncovering 
          possibilities rather than with codification. My key words would be exploring 
          and maintaining; exploring a forest not for the timber that might be 
          sold, but to understand as a world and to keep this world alive.” And 
          a little bit further: “I don’t want to write ‘about’ any issues, not 
          even feminist ones, I prefer exploring the forest to hewing a road, 
          even if the road is in a good direction.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [5] </span></a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Exploring the forest rather than collecting its 
          timber, exploring the forest rather than hewing a road: this is a perfect 
          image of Waldrop’s <span
lang=EN-AU style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>metier</span>. If it doesn’t 
          quite work in <i>Hanky</i>, perhaps it’s because the <i>between</i> 
          world she is trying to capture remains, in this case, largely inaccessible. 
          I am not speaking of facts or specific memories of childhood or adolescence 
          but rather the kind of introspection and variation we find in Waldrop’s 
          favorite novelist Robert Musil. The Franz Huber affair, like the related 
          Laff story, with its negative effect on Bob (who responds to his wife’s 
          infidelity by having his own affair), strikes me as a distraction from 
          the pressing questions that motivated Waldrop’s autobiographical project 
          in the first place: namely, what, if any, is the bond between this particular 
          daughter and her unremittingly nasty mother? And how could someone as 
          open-minded and tolerant as Rosmarie Waldrop, a dweller, like Emily 
          Dickinson, in possibility, emerge from the stifling Bavarian small town 
          where she lived and studied until she was eighteen? The reader does 
          not expect answers to these impossibly painful questions, nor is the 
          author in any way obligated to present us with a set of “well-rounded” 
          characters, but one feels that the conflicting values inherent in the 
          situation might have been confronted more fully. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop herself seems to have been quite aware 
          of the problem. “<i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i>,” she remarks 
          in “The Ground is the Only Figure,” “tries to get at the Nazi time, 
          obliquely. Not the ambition of a map, at best a small periplus along 
          an edge. But still reference to a given ‘reality.’ And foregrounding 
          a mapmaker’s concern with scale, with the foreshortening inherent in 
          representation, which can reduce a woman’s whole life to the one gesture 
          of dropping her handkerchief. <i>Not my usual way</i>” (ILS 5, my italics). 
          Accordingly, when she came back to the Nazi theme ten years later, “reference 
          to a given ‘reality’” becomes no more than trace structure, and the 
          “mapmaker’s concern with scale” gives way to a concentration on the 
          Wittgensteinian language game as a “form of life.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [6] </span></a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The title <i>Split Infinites</i> immediately sets 
          the stage for the non-representational mode of the new sequence. <i>Infinite</i> 
          means “limitless or endless in space, extent, or size; impossible to 
          measure or calculate”: the <i>New Oxford American Dictionary</i> gives 
          as illustrations, “the infinite mercy of God/ the infinite number of 
          stars in the universe.” A related meaning is “very great in amount or 
          degree,” as in “he bathed the wound with infinite care.” An “infinite 
          series” is one “able to be continued indefinitely.” Note that in all 
          this instances<i> infinite </i>is an adjective, whereas Waldrop uses 
          it as a plural noun, punning, with the modifier split, on “infinitives.” 
          The <i>infinitive</i>, of course, is “the basic form of a verb, without 
          an inflection binding it to a particular subject or tense.” As such, 
          it is crucial to Waldrop’s poetic project, as she sees it in “The Ground 
          is the Only Figure”:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>THE OPENING OF THE FIELD</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          Open as avoiding premature definition of the work as of myself. Not</div>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>a mirror on the inside of the lid, to discover things about myself, 
              rather a window, opposite direction, room with a view, lean out, 
              into the next moment, the unknown. (ILS 4) </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A split infinitive is the grammatical “error” of 
          inserting an adverb between preposition and verb of the infinitive form, 
          as in “to quickly turn” rather than “to turn quickly.” Split infinitives 
          are so widely used we no longer consider them grammatical faults. Waldrop’s 
          title thus suggests that a given story (detached from a particular subject 
          or tense) is not only able to be continued indefinitely, its repercussions 
          impossible to measure, but that it is also “split” by seemingly extraneous 
          and irrelevant material that blocks access to particular situations 
          and the emotions they produced. The poet’s childhood memories are precisely 
          such split infinites, the nominalization of the adjective “infinite” 
          suggesting condition rather than argument — in Waldrop’s parlance, forest 
          rather than road.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The sequence “Split Infinites” is itself a “split,” 
          placed as it is as the third item between the more abstract and playful 
          language games of “Pre &amp; con, or, Positions and Junctions,” and 
          “Cornered Stones” that precede it and the meditations of mind/body splits 
          in “Seven Senses” and “Morning’s Intelligence” that follow. Again, while 
          #1 (“Pre &amp; Con”) and #5 (“Morning’s Intelligence”) are made up of 
          short lyric poems, the middle three sequences, are written in tight 
          prose paragraphs of one to nine line units — paragraphs perhaps modeled 
          on Beckett’s <i>How It Is</i>, where, as in “Split Infinites,” the forward 
          momentum of the sentence is constantly halted by repetition, variation, 
          sound echo, and interruption. Again and again, this form implies, one 
          tries to arrest the “split infinites” of one’s existence in such <i>faux</i> 
          closural units of thought only to discover that the neat unit cannot 
          contain the experience. And further: the paragraphs within the various 
          sequences often function centripetally as well as centrifugally: item# 
          3 in “Association” (SI 50), for example, which begins with the sentences 
          “Explosives. It was war. There were no condoms. We swapped knives to 
          peel off childhood like so many skins,” might be shifted over to the 
          final poem, “Composing Stick,” which has passages like “Any form of 
          thought a spasm of pleasure if we could get at it. Mother cleared my 
          throat” (70).</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A sentence must be understood in the context of 
          the language game in which it appears. “Mother cleared my throat”: each 
          of the four words is perfectly transparent but the sentence makes no 
          sense because only I can clear my throat. Attributed to Mother, the 
          act of clearing the throat becomes sinister: mother, it would seem, 
          wouldn’t allow her daughter to say or even think certain things. Throughout 
          the sequence, as we shall see, Waldrop puts such standard sentences 
          as “I cleared my throat” under the microscope, transforming, dislocating, 
          or splicing them so as to create a whole array of new meanings. Here, 
          for example, is “Memory Tree”<span

      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The material here will not be unfamiliar to the reader 
        of <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i>. But this time the leaves shaken 
        from the poet’s “memory tree” are presented, not as collage, with various 
        bits of found text, conversations, letters and narratives spliced together, 
        but as the elliptical narrative of a detached speaker — a narrative made 
        up of sharply etched images, incomplete sentences, non sequiturs, aphorisms 
        that seem to be misapplied, and tired clichés that turn out to be only 
        too true. The notion of a “Memory Tree,” for that matter, is itself a 
        cliché, what with the tendentious references in paragraph #8 to “Eating 
        of the tree [of knowledge]” to the ubiquitous “hole in memory,” to leaves 
        ominously “falling before the fall,” and the “Orchard long-abandoned” 
        (SI 59). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But the familiar cliché, coupled with the stories 
        of Snow White and the Boy Who Cried Wolf in the poem, lulls us into a 
        false sense of security: this “memory tree” sheds some rather startling 
        leaves. The opening line, “AND SECONDLY, in German” is immediately arresting, 
        suggesting as it does that something should have come first. But what? 
        Does Waldrop mean that she can deal with these traumatic events better 
        in English, her adopted language, and can face them, only SECONDLY in 
        German? That for the English-speaking reader, the things to be related 
        are part of a secondary, German world? Or that the German language is 
        itself a vehicle tainted by the material it has been forced to relate 
        and is hence secondary or spoken secondly? </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The next paragraph begins with documentary precision: 
        “My first schoolday, September 1941.” (Waldrop was six at the time). But 
        then realism modulates into ironic commentary, tempered by intricate sound 
        repetition. There is nothing exceptional about it being a “cool day” (September 
        in Germany is typically cool), but “cool” rhymes with “school,” even as 
        “salute,” two lines later, rhymes with “flute,” both rhymes underscoring 
        the regimentation of the first-grade classroom, in which “Time did not 
        pass but was conducted to the brain.” Everything in this classroom is 
        dictated, ordered, controlled. In such a milieu, one isn’t “taught” arithmetic 
        or spelling; one is merely <i>taught</i> or rather indoctrinated. Here 
        “Nazi salute” rhymes with “flute,” because one of the ironies of the Hitler 
        regime was that certain traditional German values, like playing a musical 
        instrument, continued to be admired. Hence, “How firmly entrenched, the 
        ancient theory.” The mockery of the System continues in the sentence, 
        “I was already using paper, pen and ink.” Pen and ink, yes, but of course 
        one writes on paper. The final sentence is especially resonant. “Yes, 
        I said, I’m here.” Here in the classroom responding to roll call. Here 
        in <i>this</i> school, this town, at this moment! And also “here” in the 
        poem that re-presents these things.&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The German “memory tree” also sheds leaves from the 
        Grimm brothers’ fairy tales. “I was six or seven dwarfs, the snow was 
        white, the prince at war, Hitler on the radio.” The six or seven dwarfs 
        fit in perfectly here since the child is between six and seven and, vis-à-vis 
        to the grown-ups, she’s a “dwarf.” Not one dwarf for she does not yet 
        have a clear-cut identity of her own, but six or seven. The prince who 
        should rescue Snow White is at war, as was Waldrop’s father at the time; 
        he is replaced by the voice of Hitler on the radio followed incongruously 
        by the light operatic music of Franz Léhar of <i>Merry Widow</i> fame. 
        Is the poet’s mother the unnamed wicked queen of <i>Snow White</i>? The 
        unfaithful Merry Widow? The mother’s adultery, described in such detail 
        in <i>Hanky</i> is only hinted at here. What mainly impinges on the senses 
        is the noise of “blackouts, sirens, mattress on the floor, furtive visitor 
        of ghost.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The experience remembered in the third paragraph 
        is that of birth, but who is in labor here? Since “mother was furious,” 
        and the poet’s sister “crying unseen,” it seems to be the Polish girl 
        mentioned later, the sister’s friend. Then again, there is the reference 
        in #7 to “my soul in blue jeans, my mother in childbirth,” so that the 
        scene may be that of a stillbirth or even abortion. What remains etched 
        in the child’s mind, in any case, is the mother’s fury, the sound of the 
        air raid sirens, the hiss of the cat, the crying of her sister. She is 
        “Afraid to look.” And the “labor (forced) or pregnant” also refers to 
        the forced labor camps all over Germany where girls like this Polish one 
        may have been working . The story is, in any case, so painful to relate 
        that the narrator suddenly switches to normalcy, “I had learned to ride 
        a bike.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The “menace of a different color” in the next paragraph 
        is that of the Nazi army in their brown shirts; “labor” oddly merges with 
        the “forced” labor of the prisoners of war, the “uniform movement” (note 
        the pun on “uniform”) of the troops moving (marching? riding the train?) 
        “with unsurpassed speed.” No one explains to the child what the “deep 
        interiors of the body” contains. But the signs, especially the recurring 
        image of the black cat in the white snow, are ominous. Paragraph #5 is 
        especially painful. The opening sentence, “Mother, I cried, extremely,” 
        is oddly ungrammatical. One cries loudly or violently or bitterly, but 
        “extremely” is an adverb of modification: it must apply to an adjective 
        and here there is none. The comma, moreover, creates confusion, separating 
        “I cried” from both “Mother” and the adverb. In the context, the sentence 
        is thus all the more upsetting. The young girl can’t stop crying, whatever 
        the “extreme” situation is. “Cried,” moreover, means not only “wept” but 
        “shouted,” “cried out.” Here it refers to the child’s warning: she becomes 
        the boy who cried wolf. In the parable itself, the boy warns of danger 
        where there is none and so no one listens to his cry and the wolf gets 
        him. But at the time itself, the poet recalls, she didn’t understand these 
        things. At home in the white snow we have met throughout the poem, there 
        was “wool pulled over my eyes.” Literally, a heavy<span style='font-family:Georgia;'> 
        woolen</span> scarf to keep the cold out. In the terms of the dead metaphor, 
        however, the girl is presented as blind or blinded (by whom?) to what 
        is really going on. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But, the poet notes, “the boy who did not cry it 
        also died.” So hopeless is the wartime scene that it doesn’t matter whether 
        one is the boy who cried wolf or the boy who didn’t. The phrase “Twilight 
        overtures” suggests that Death comes regardless. And so, in #6, the Snow 
        White fairy-tale motif (“Face fair, black hair”), coupled with the ominous 
        shadow of the black cat, already mentioned in #2 and #3, is fused with 
        the terrifying image of a birth, perhaps to the Polish girl, perhaps to 
        the Mother, all against the backdrop of “bells (hells, shells), of sirens, 
        hiss of bombs.” The mood is not one of sarcasm or anger as in <i>Hanky</i>, 
        but one of pure terror. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Throughout the sequence, Waldrop conveys that terror 
        in her fusion of real and surreal, of parable, fairytale, and documentary. 
        In “Delta Waves,” for example, “War came out of the radio before I had 
        time” (62). Time to turn it off? To get away? To resist it? But there 
        is no time, only “Obedience as a time of life,” with Mother, like the 
        sinister “Madame” of Rimbaud’s “Mémoire,” pacing back and forth to no 
        purpose so that the narrator becomes so distraught, she all but breaks 
        down:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Wiping my feet became difficult. Speaking, even in cursive<br>
          script, impossible. Swallowed up by deep woods. All falling<br>
          still, all lapse. (62).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This recalls Beckett’s “Still” and “Imagination Dead 
        Imagine,” but <i>Split Infinites</i> is more ironic than either of the 
        above. Take the reference above to “cursive script.” One doesn’t, of course, 
        speak in script, cursive or otherwise, so that the sentence seems to make 
        no sense. But Waldrop is, I think, referring to something quite specific: 
        Hitler’s order, in 1941, to eliminate <i>Kurrent</i>, the Old German script 
        still taught in all schools, whose use was making communication with the 
        outside world difficult. “Speaking, even in cursive script, impossible” 
        is thus a double entendre. It became impossible because the cursive was 
        outlawed. But conversely, its use, in the context, equally made “speaking” 
        impossible. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Split Infinites</i> is thus a very special kind 
        of “life writing,” an <i>auto-graph</i> which creates, via linguistic 
        density rather than life writing or auto<i>bio</i>graphy, a “splice of 
        life” (ILS 13) in which “identity,” in the usual sense, dissolves in favor 
        of the “space of language,” as Waldrop calls it in “The Ground is the 
        Only Figure.” Paradoxically, the references to the Nazi and wartime trauma 
        that give the sequence its <i>raison d'être</i> resonate much more fully 
        here where they are so obliquely used than in the more “realistic” Kitzingen 
        narrative in <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i>, with its speculations 
        on sexual love, betrayal, and the difference between generations. In <i>Split 
        Infinites</i>, the war becomes, first and foremost, a condition of <i>language</i>. 
        “I thought,” we read in “Delta Waves,” “lightning and thunder meant two 
        clouds colliding” (SI 63).</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span
lang=EN-AU>“Language,” observes Wittgenstein, “sets everyone the same traps; it 
        is an immense network of easily accessible wrong turnings. . . What I 
        have to do then is erect signposts at all the junctions where there are 
        wrong turnings so as to help people past the danger points.””<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
        [7] </span></a><i>Split Infinites</i> is a poem about precisely such language 
        traps. The poet can never get at “the truth” about her past. She can only 
        “erect signposts” so as to designate what are at bottom the unspeakable 
        events — unspeakable even in cursive! — that consumed her childhood. “The 
        frequency of rhythm,” as we read in “Delta Waves,” “[is] more important 
        than its amplitude” (SI 63).</span></p>
