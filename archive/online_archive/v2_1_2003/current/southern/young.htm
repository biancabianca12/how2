        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When I look at these poems as a group, I remember 
          how they all shared the quality of refusing to be shaped. They came out 
          of chaos and refused to stray far from it. All are about some kind of 
          transformation or purification. Water purifies. The volcano that destroys 
          also creates fertile land. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">All of the poems are trying to get to the source 
          of something: the creation, the combustion, the fire. I am preoccupied 
          with that particular element. I notice that even the water poem, “little 
          song of dissolution,” has “flame alone” in the middle of its liquidity.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I remember an enjoyment in writing them (though they 
          all came at different times) and think that manifested in the asterisks 
          and dashes, a lack of line breaks (with the exception of “little song 
          of dissolution” which has a kind of sporadic impulse toward them), and 
          their odd little shapes. &nbsp;</p>

        <p>Bring me the match and the kindling, the paper shredded into strips; 
          watch the spark take <br>
          between twigs, the brown needles on the small branch ignite and sputter; 
          note as the smoke <br>
          streams up like breath; watch the room as it grows new shadows, the tongues 
          of flame, tall and jagged; listen to the crackle as it creeps through 
          floorboards and starts to crawl the wall; see the structure of the beams 
          as the map of their making is revealed; stay as we watch our dark creation, 
          <br>
          the cinders born, the paint curl and burnish; open the window so the air 
          will feed it; fire is a<br>
          music — it sings as it consumes; consume me with the music of your skin 
          as we rush to roar and flames rain down, and feed my singing flesh the 
          cool benefit of your mouth until we’re one, <br>
          enmeshed, in ash.</p>

          <i>—</i> Julio Cortázar 
        <p> * I am a volcano, in a state of mild eruption, with <br>
          slight harmonic tremors I rupture and shake* today I woke up and burst 
          into flames * a fever in <br>
          the brain * a volcano born in a field * a heart that glows like a blown-on 
          coal * last time we met <br>
          you drank water from my palm, cupped the clear water, cooling the fire 
          that is everywhere, just a matter of spotting it: the sudden flare, the 
          shift and flicker * I am a disciple of flame and you are burning *  a 
          well of flame that has no eyes just orange claws and a mouth of glowing 
          embers * phlogiston: the being inflammable, the matter of fire seen as 
          fixed * we are combustible, what <br>
          remains when we burn? * what if we sleep and the heat doesn’t lift while 
          we lie still as corpses <br>
          then wake to the same tat tat tick of fever wanting to press to glass 
          our capillary maps? * I do not want to burn I am burning * I call the 
          four directions I beckon the elements I summon the holy <br>
          three * <i>My passions, concentrated on a single point, resemble the rays 
          of a sun assembled by a magnifying glass; they immediately set fire to 
          whatever object they find in their way </i>— Marquis de Sade</p>

        <p CLASS="TITLE2"><A NAME="3" id="3"></A>The tree groaned
        <p>The tree groaned as it fell, almost human * axes split it open, thunk 
          and whack, sprayed its pale <br>
          dust in an arc * we stacked the broken limbs into a heap * crisp was the 
          life that left it, <br>
          brightening the air * it dried in the sun, shrinking * we broke the twigs 
          and felt the snapping *<br>
          we piled the wood into the pit * between the pieces we put smaller pieces, 
          between these we<br>
          stuffed paper *  we stuck black chunks of our coal inside * we sang to 
          the earth’s dark belly * the sparks sang back*</p>
