        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In many poems in the sequence <i>fabled hue</i>, 
          I worked with various kinds of repetition. In “why a memory of birds,” 
          for example, I use anaphoric repetition, beginning each sentence with 
          the same type of grammatical construction. In “below leaves words,” it 
          is sound patterns that are repeated. In the poems in <i>hummer flumes</i>, 
          I scavenged some of my dream journals from several years ago. Images and 
          events in the dreams were subjected to various types of manipulations 
          and experiments. Here, too, the use of repetitions sometimes guided the 
          compositional process.&nbsp;</P>

                    door. as an invitation to flawed movements or familiar quotes

                    a flimsy excuse and a few cobbled social graces offered to exemplary

                    with a recap of tinsel events in the shambles of a happy swagger. 
                    i am nothing like that happy swagger eating wild strawberries 
                    within sight of the finish line. i am not where can be found 
                    a bright holy braid in a junk village morgue. nothing of birdsong
