            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>1. Awakenings</b></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Reading Jamaica Kinkaid’s <i>Lucy </i>some 
              time ago, I had a shock of recognition. In a highly anti-climatic 
              scene, Mariah, the woman whose children Lucy takes care of, having 
              driven her to a Boston park, blindfolds her to enhance the surprise 
              she anticipates the girl will experience in seeing a green stretch 
              of lawn strewn with daffodils. But Lucy’s reaction surprises her. 
              Like a bull in front of a red cloth, at the sight of the daffodils, 
              Lucy has a fit of rage: “‘Mariah, do you realize that at ten years 
              of age I had to learn a poem about some flowers I would not see 
              in real life until I was nineteen?’” (29- 30). Daffodils  are for 
              her not beautiful yellow flowers, but  a word and the title of a 
              poem by Wordsworth she had to learn in school. Synonymous with British 
              colonialism, the word evokes memories of forced acculturation into 
              a tradition and a mental reality that elided her own experience, 
              her own land, her own self; into values she was taught to consider 
              superior. The flowers disappear as concrete reality and, one with 
              the word, trigger “a scene of conquered and conquests; a scene  
              of brutes masquerading as angels and angels portrayed as brutes.” 
              (30).</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My first translations date back to the early 
              seventies, when I felt myself colonised by a patriarchal culture 
              and a man-made language. This awareness, however, would only have 
              initiated political or critical action had I not been fascinated 
              with words, as Jamaica Kinkaid’s Lucy is. At the time I was under 
              the powerful influence of Virginia Woolf, Adrienne Rich, H. D. and 
              Toni Maraini, whose novel, <i>Anno 1424, </i>has recently been published 
              by City Lights under the title <i>Sealed in Stone.</i></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">From the beginning translating has been for 
              me a way of acquiring more powerful sensing tools, of finding new 
              ways “to say it,” as in the title of Marie Cardinal’s influential 
              book. The poet I translate is, as Virgil for Dante, a guide, a person 
              who shows me the way into new words and new worlds, but whom I must 
              leave to move on. There is a precise moment when translating came 
              to be a necessity, the path I had to follow to, at least vicariously, 
              explore the possibilities of my own language and culture. A long 
              time has passed, but whenever I remember it — even now — I feel 
              the same emotion. I think of it as of one of my ‘moments of being’.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It was a very hot September, and I was doing 
              research at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., reading 
              on the eighteenth and nineteenth century debates about the “American” 
              language. Sitting at my desk in the stacks, immersed in a dimly 
              lit and dusty atmosphere, I was behaving as a serious researcher, 
              trying to get the most out of the hours spent  within that sacred 
              hall of learning. That day, however, on the way to the library, 
              I had stopped at a bookstore and bought Adrienne Rich’s <i>A Dream 
              of a Common Language</i>, which had just appeared<i>.</i> Bored 
              with what I was reading, I took Rich’s book out of its bag, with 
              its pages smelling of fresh print and new words. I read  all the 
              poems, from beginning to end, and then started over again. For the 
              first time I did not  feel one of many anonymous readers. Those 
              poems spoke directly to me. After a whole life spent in school, 
              as a learner and as a teacher, it was also the first time I deeply 
              realized that a poem is not an object to be reverently contemplated, 
              or the starting point for critical and theoretical acrobatics. Rich’s 
              poems had life energy, an energy that they passed on to me and became 
              mine through the simple act of reading, of letting it run through 
              my body and my mind. It was there and then that I decided to translate 
              <i>A Dream, </i>together with other poems by Adrienne Rich. It was 
              also through those poems that I became interested in H. D., whose 
              <i>Trilogy</i> I translated a few years later.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>2. A particular language and poetic language</b></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What does a reader look for in a book, Virginia 
              Woolf asks, immediately answering that it is certainly not pages 
              full of sensible and honest words, but love “Meaning by that, where 
              is the sound of the sea and the red of the rose; where is music, 
              imagery, and a voice speaking from the heart?” That is exactly what 
              a reader wants to find also in the translated text. For this to 
              happen the translator must immerse herself in the language of the 
              original poem, in the world of the poet, and come out, like Alice 
              in Wonderland, in the world of her native language, culture and 
              literature and use words and sentences that make the senses, the 
              intellect, the imagination of the reader come alive.  In a poem 
              all the levels of language play a part, every silence contributes 
              to the overall sense. A sense that is neither the sum nor the multiplication 
              of its words’ semantic meanings, nor only the sense the author meant 
              to convey. Life, built in the words by generations of users, still 
              hides behind and beyond the will of the author, large and independent: 
              it makes space for the translator and for the reader. As in the 
              original poem sounds and words can point towards an emotion, an 
              image, a concept, an event that gathers and condenses textual discourse, 
              similarly in a translated text that convergence must be recovered. 
              I can offer as an example an instance taken from my translation 
              of H. D.’s <i>Trilogy. </i>In section 25 of <i>The Walls Do Not 
              Fall</i>, the first book of <i>Trilogy,</i> emotion and desire concentrate 
              in a few words:</p>
          </div>
          <blockquote> 
            <div class=Section1>Take me home<br>
              where canals</div>
            <div class=Section1> 
              <p>flow<br>
                between iris-banks:</p>

            <div class=Section1> 
              <p>. . .<br>
                where the grasshopper says<br>
                <i><span lang=DE>Amen, Amen, Amen.</span></i></p>
            </div>
            <div class=Section1> 
              <p>My translation reads:</p>
            </div>
            <div class=Section1><span lang=IT>Portami a casa<br>
              </span><span lang=IT>dove canali</span></div>

              </span><i><span lang=DE>Amen, Amen, Amen.</span></i></div>
          </blockquote>
          <div class=Section1> 
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In H. D.’s text <i>home </i>takes on a complex 
              of senses that go beyond the literal, metaphorical and symbolic 
              meanings usually associated with the word. <i>Home</i>, in the poem, 
              and within the context of <i>Trilogy, </i>is more than “house” or 
              “motherland” as normally interpreted. Word and rhythmic stress falling 
              on it, emphasize the silence that follows, at the end of the line. 
              A silence that prolongs with an echo the [m] sound — but the letter 
              <i>m</i>, associated with <i>mother</i>, is also very important 
              in H. D.’s kabbalistic language — following the aspiration (the 
              spirit) of the [h] sound and the mourning of  the <i>o</i> [ou] 
              sound<i>. </i>Graphic lay-out, sound pattern and line division combine 
              to create an imaginary condition in which aspiration and desire, 
              loss and suffering meet, converging on the word <i>home,</i> that<i> 
              </i>gathers the speaker’s desire for a precise destination. It has 
              not been difficult to translate the poem, for the language is very 
              simple but I had to face a major problem: I could not convey into 
              the Italian word <i>casa</i> all the charged senses present in the 
              original <i>home</i>. I decided then to focus on the vocative verb 
              <i>po<b>r</b>tami</i>, as well as on movement rather than on destination, 
              associate the verb with the <i>sco<b>rr</b>e<b>r</b>e </i>(flow) 
              of water, and emphasize the connotative effect of  the rolling sound 
              [r], that I iterate in the words <i>t<b>r</b>a, <b>r</b>ive, </i>and<i> 
              i<b>r</b>is. </i>H. D.’s lines were written in 1941, in a London 
              besieged by the fire of German bombs. In the poem the American poet’s 
              yearning for her homeland as a place of hope and salvation fuses 
              with the woman’s and artist’s wish to re-appropriate her own birth, 
              her own mother-muse, and the origins of female spirituality. Her 
              poetry wants to recover the healing power necessary to regenerate 
              a culture beset by recurring wars, by death and destruction. And, 
              though the poem itself is an invocation to the god Amen-Christus, 
              <i>home </i>also alludes to the Nile swamps, the reign of Isis, 
              and to a feminine integrity and divinity that, according to Bachofen, 
              characterized human spirituality before a male-inflected divinity 
              took over. If the word <i>home </i>gathers<i> </i>the symbolic and 
              narrative meanings of the text, the verb <i>flow</i>, isolated as 
              it is in a single line, with the fluidity of its sounds, silence 
              preceding and following it, invites the reader to perceive the scene, 
              to imagine canals that run between banks of irises, appealing not 
              to emotion but to vision.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“She was self-effacing in her attack on those 
              Greek words, she was flamboyantly ambitious,” H. D.writes of Julia, 
              the protagonist of <i>Bid Me To Live (A Madrigal),</i> who is translating 
              a Greek text (162). For Julia “ words themselves held inner words” 
              and if one looked at them carefully enough, or long enough, one 
              would discover a “peculiar twist,” a “magic angle” leading to “that 
              Phoenician track, told by old traders” (162). “Anyone can translate 
              the meaning of the word,” Julia thinks, but she wants “the shape, 
              the feel of it, the character of it, as if it had been freshly minted” 
              (163). As Marina Cvetaeva wrote in a letter to Rilke (255), to write 
              poetry is already to translate from the mother language into another 
              language, a universal language, that crosses boundaries and cultures, 
              a language that surfaces when words lose their exclusive connection 
              with a particular language and attain a new life. It is this language 
              that it is necessary to save in a translation. The translator who 
              is not a poet must learn from poets and from all those who shape 
              language, how to look for a word that exactly fits the experience 
              in life, in dreams, in visions she wants to convey. A translator 
              needs to unlearn her automatic use of language, her unquestioning 
              habits as much as she needs to learn how to choose, or create, words 
              and sounds, how to combine them. She needs to have the greatest 
              command of her own maternal language in order to be able to go beyond 
              it towards Cvetaeva’s  poetic language, or, with H. D., uncover 
              the word within the word. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>3. Living between languages</b></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“I translate his books and live between his 
              language and mine,” writes the female protagonist in one of  the 
              stories in Susan Sontag’s <i>I, Etcetera </i>(105)<i>.</i> Sontag 
              reminds us that in order to translate, besides passion and vision, 
              one must also have competence. A translator must be able to move 
              between two languages and two cultures that may be close or far 
              apart, or both, close and very much different. For, if it is true 
              that poetry communicates in a universal language, it is also true 
              that it is written in a particular language which has its own rules 
              and its literary and cultural traditions. In Sontag’s story the 
              protagonist, a professional translator, reflecting on the English 
              language and its lack of masculine and feminine gender endings, 
              concludes: </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <blockquote>
          <div class=DOUBLESPACE>
            <div class=Section1>As a translator, I’m aware that this may be the 
              only language in the world that allows me to leave the matter open. 
              (Except for having to steer away from a telltale “his” or “her,” 
              it shouldn’t be hard.) All other languages I know are saturated 
              with gender. A little triumph. I have the pleasure of writing, myself, 
              something that <i>can’t </i>be translated. (126)</div>
          </div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=DOUBLESPACE>
          <div class=Section1> 
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A translator can annihilate herself, or hide 
              her presence, just like Julia in <i>Bid Me To Live (A Madrigal)</i> 
              and the narrator in Sontag’s story, who can hide her sexual identity 
              by avoiding the use of gender pronouns. On the contrary, by using 
              gender marks, she can manifest her presence. If the translator is 
              a mediator, certainly her mediation is not neuter. For someone like 
              me, who translates from English into Italian, a major problem is 
              exactly one of rendering a language without grammatical gender into 
              one governed by grammatical gender. Every solution one finds to 
              this problem implies a choice, not only of word, but of world values. 
              Again my best examples come from my translation of H. D.’s <i>Trilogy</i>. 
              In section 40 of “The Walls Do Not Fall” we read: “recover the secret 
              of Isis, / which is: there was One // in the beginning, Creator, 
              / Fosterer, Begetter, the Same-forever // in the papyrus-swamp / 
              in the Judean meadow.” H. D. avoids attributing a precise gender 
              to her divinity, and characterizes it as both creative and pro-creative. 
              In my translation the name of the goddess Isis and her female identity 
              forces me to use feminine gender endings. <span lang=IT>Here is 
              my Italian translation: “C’era Una / all’inizio, Creatrice // Nutrice, 
              Sempiterna, Generatrice.” </span>I had to simplify and substitute 
              a female goddess to the male god of patriarchal tradition. In this 
              way, however, I lost H. D.’s construction of a divine that comes 
              before, and after, gender polarization and male cultural domination, 
              which is also her contribution to the transformation of Western 
              culture. In another instance, the poetic subject in the text maintains: 
              “we do not forget/ Love, the Creator, // <i>her</i> chariot and 
              white doves” [ section 34]. <i>Her</i> refers to the Love goddess 
              Venus but in Italian the masculine word <i>amore</i> and the feminine 
              <i>Venere</i> are difficult to combine in a sentence. In order to 
              solve the problem I had to delete the masculine article that would 
              go before <i>Amore</i> and give the noun a feminine sense. <span lang=IT>This 
              is the result: “senza scordare / Amore, la creatrice, // col carro 
              e le bianche colombe.”  </span>In this instance I recovered some 
              of the textual complexity and somehow made up for the loss in the 
              previous example. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span>            </span>Still different is 
              the case in which a translator has to deal with cultural and symbolic 
              gender, also inscribed in language. A clear instance are the two 
              poems in “The Walls Do Not Fall” H. D. devoted to the sea-shell 
              [4] and to the worm [6]. When referring to the sea-shell and its 
              substitutes, H. D. always uses <i>it</i>, while I had to alternate 
              the feminine of <i>conchiglia</i> to the masculine of <i>artigiano</i> 
              (<i>craftsman</i>) and <i>muratore </i>(<i>master-mason</i>). But 
              further on in the text, when the poetic subject reveals her female 
              identity, I can attribute to the speaking <i>I</i> a feminine gender 
              ending (<i>closed in, complete, immortal </i>/ <i>chiusa dentro, 
              piena, immortale</i>), thus making explicit the cultural feminine 
              symbolism of the shell.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Power and Danger: Works of a Common Woman” 
              Adrienne Rich writes: “Poetry is above all a concentration of the 
              <i>power </i>of language, which is the power of our ultimate relationship 
              to everything in the universe.” But, she also reminds us, “poetry 
              is, among other things, a criticism of language” (248). </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A translator cannot choose the content, but 
              she can choose the language of her translated text and thus recover 
              both the <i>power </i>of poetry and the criticism of language.</p>
