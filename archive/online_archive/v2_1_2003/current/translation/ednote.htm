          <p class="Doublespace"></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">In “Drafts 44: Stretto,” Rachel Blau DuPlessis 
            writes of a disparity between experience and perception while sounding 
            a call to poetry’s material capacities: “Thought is frightened / for 
            it can’t think anywhere near the size of what has happened / to bring 
            <u>is</u> forth and set it rolling out.” She continues her exploration 
            of poetical responses and responsibilities by invoking a “glinting world” 
            whose clouded skies are “tangled in the long veil of the page,” and 
            completes her meditation by gendering a curious and urgent “gift” of 
            fear:</p>

        <div class=Section1>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">For many writers and artists in this edition of 
            <i>HOW2</i>, DuPlessis’s words hold singular and troubling currency. 
            Relations between congested material occurrences and poetry’s timing 
            — between our descriptions and our perceptions of the world as it appears 
            to unfold — are crucial to the texts and visual works that congregate 
            at this issue’s mis/fitting seams. Since <i>HOW2</i>’s Fall 2002 edition, 
            an ongoing war has been declared and carried out against and within 
            Iraq by a coalition of political and media forces including the governments 
            of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. “Sometimes I 
            can’t see clearly,” writes Geraldine McKenzie in the first of two New 
            Writing features. “[T]his light sun of forgone conclusions drives the 
            day / bitter pace and headlong into what never ceases / work which was 
            punishment due our hard place / the squandered skirts of heaven… / it’s 
            raining and the world comes out to watch.” Or as DuPlessis observes, 
            equally acute in another context, thought is frightened, for it can’t 
            think anywhere near the size of what has happened. How other than in 
            kinds of fright are we to approach the Bush administration’s “New American 
            Century”?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">Thought also is revitalized and made sharp by such 
            blunt events. As writers and thinkers “we’re called to run a time <u>behind</u>, 
            <u>upon</u>, <u>within</u>, <u>inside</u> / plus <u>of</u> that scroll.” 
            This might be the gift to which DuPlessis refers: a gift of critical 
            calling, not predatory upon political spectacle and catastrophe, but 
            finding ways to acknowledge and apprehend them — despite (and to resist) 
            their near-normalization via a profound array of everyday rhetorical 
            strategies. Carla Harryman offers this in “The Ear of the Poet in the 
            Mouth of the Performer,” featured in Kathleen Fraser’s “Resisting Type” 
            In-Conference panel:</p>
          <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=Section1>The challenge of writing anything has been at stake 
            for me since the U.S. response to 9/11 became an excuse to militarize 
            against Iraq. The pleasure in the idea that I could be writing about 
            my own art activity and its genre excesses is contradicted by the loss 
            of a sense of what? Form? Desire? Motivation? What do I mean by a loss 
            of a sense of form-desire?…Or perhaps what I am experiencing is not 
            exactly a loss of a sense of form-motivation, but the signal of a breaking 
            point.<o:p></o:p></div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1> 
          <p class="Doublespace"></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">We must ask these questions, even as we sometimes 
            feel their inadequacies, or mistrust the point of doing so. They are 
            questions <i>in</i> and <i>about</i> contexts for our writerly and scholarly 
            labors. They make a political address to the how and here of knowing. 
            How might community-based poetry and art projects like <i>HOW2</i> respond 
            to such breaking points, and what kinds of signals do we mean to transmit? 
            In current political weathers “the challenge of writing anything” — 
            a challenge embodying vastly different scales of action, impact, place 
            and experience — is undeniably “at stake.”</p>
          <p class="Doublespace"></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">This edition of <i>HOW2</i>, the first in a second 
            online volume, includes dozens of different and edgy tussles with “breaking 
            points.” A break is partly a beginning. It can provoke new currents 
            of thinking and radical revisions of what has passed already, while 
            stressing matters of form and method. In “Networking Women: an Instance,” 
            Renata Morresi cites Nancy Cunard’s notion of “the underneath of history” 
            as a stepping-off point for a feminist revision of London-based modernist 
            journal <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>, focusing on the editorial influence 
            of Bryher (born Winifred Ellerman). Morresi’s work appears in the second 
            of our In-Conference features, “Networking Women: Subjects, Places, 
            Links Europe-America 1890-1939,” alongside complementary revisionist 
            accounts of modernist cultural, sexual and publication economies by 
            Marina Camboni, Diana Collecott and Gigliola Sacerdoti Mariani. Collecott’s 
            “Another Bloomsbury: Women’s Networks in Literary London during World 
            War One” reminds us that certain narratives <i>need</i> to be broken 
            so that we might recover “the buried, the wasted and the lost,” as Mariani 
            writes — stories of living from history’s underside that are obscured 
            too easily in the competitive and powerful babble of conventional and 
            complacent literary myth-making.</p>
          <p class="Doublespace"></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">Julia Lisella’s Readings on American modernist 
            Genevieve Taggard continue the project of excavation and witness. Under 
            a rubric of “the Genevieve Taggard effect,” Alison Van Nyhuis critiques 
            “the marginalization of poets or the production of canonical/poetic 
            misfits <i>because </i>their body of work does not squarely rest on 
            either side of a literary divide.” She calls for holistic interrogations 
            of anthologizing processes, which consider the life conditions and artistic 
            intentions of specific writers rather than imposing upon them “our own 
            discursive confections” — whether we lionize them as exemplary renegades, 
            or censor them into conformity. Catherine Daly unpicks several of Taggard’s 
            little-circulated pamphlet poems, while Nancy Berke scrutinizes “ideologies 
            of aging” and volatile exchanges between private lyrics and public functions 
            in Taggard’s poetry, including socio-economic class categories and racially 
            biased citizenship roles within 1930s America.</p>
          <p class="Doublespace"></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">Category-panic is central to Anne Jamison’s account 
            of Virginia Woolf’s and Ezra Pound’s contrasting recuperations and repudiations 
            of Christina Rossetti’s sometime “modern cadence.” Jamison questions 
            the exclusivity and gendered convenience of genre demarcations: what 
            happens if we re-imagine Rossetti as an influential modern, by exposing 
            established hierarchies of “modernist” aesthetic and formal properties? 
            Other pieces from Alerts tackle these ideas in contemporary scenarios. 
            Jane Sprague observes how Arielle Greenberg’s “rich, collaged textual 
            world of glossy pop culture surfaces” presents an assortment of female 
            subjects who strategically manage to “sustain themselves and exist in 
            a jangled world of blurred edges, ruptured syntax and shifting subjectivity.” 
            Laura Hinton recommends “expand[ing] beyond well-grooved arguments about 
            the lyric, and mov[ing] the topic of experiment into experimental forms, 
            like the prose poem and intergenre, poems that are no longer clearly 
            ‘lyric’ anymore.” Genre is splitting at the seams — and with it, neat 
            periodizations that retreat into sameness when faced with threatening 
            difference. Broken narrations offer choices: how literally to proceed, 
            once comfortably acceptable forms are interrupted or abandoned or recast? 
            Which structures are brought to light, and which lights will be visible?</p>
          <p class="Doublespace"></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">Both New Writing segments work with problems of 
            form and alterity. In “Inappropriated Others,” Dodie Bellamy is explicit 
            about erotic taboos and encounters involving “lovers drawn to inappropriate 
            beloveds,” as Jeanne Heuving writes. “I watch fat men now, this secret 
            ostracized world of ridicule and invisibility. I feel scorn for the 
            mainstream, the hip, the cool.” (Bellamy) Kevin Killian parodies confessional 
            and hetero-normative desiring modes in his panegyric to Kylie Minogue, 
            while Christine Stewart tests limits of fantasy and corporeal risk in 
            “St. Augustine”: “I consider a certain point on the screen. / I cover 
            up one slit. I find the nonzero. // Habit descends unexpectedly / in 
            my florid sleep, // in ripe / folding / civility…/ I cradle in / the 
            remembering / of / gender. / I shred / the pink / borderless / tongue.” 
            Sound artist and visual poet Amanda Stewart shreds different forms and 
            coordinates in excerpts from “I/T,” featured in Pam Brown’s selection 
            of contemporary innovative work: “He would go spiritually with humility 
            / the / re the / her, goddesspollutedwhoresaint, and he / would save 
            her! The clean attractive would be / saved!”</p>
          <p class="Doublespace"></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">Sawako Nakayasu’s feature on contemporary Italian 
            poetry suggests diverse “breaking points” that are met during translational 
            processes. With thanks to the collaborative work of at least fifteen 
            writers and translators, we offer a series of stunning Italian poems 
            alongside their English counterparts. Milli Graffi unravels her lines 
            in a fold between inner and outer, undoing “the privilege of reticence” 
            to write: “In the indentation of the final hollow // a voice burrows 
            itself // in the privilege of reticence / last coat of the beast-like 
            heat // before the outside splinters // and ESCAPES.” Sylvia Bertoli’s 
            pared lyricism gives the act of thinking an arresting and sensual physicality: 
            “Open your mind and lean / on the indigo your thought / like a light 
            finger / which softly probes the body / of words / and follows / the 
            hare’s / anxious flight.”</p>
          <p class="Doublespace"></p>
          <p class="Doublespace">These are just some of the pleasures, serious deliberations 
            and subversive humors of the new <i>HOW2</i>. I briefly want to acknowledge 
            several other breaks, and to extend gratitude and thanks to various 
            people. This issue makes a transition to a new editorial team. Ann Vickery 
            has completed four issues as editor and leaves the role, while London-based 
            innovative writer and scholar Dell Olsen joins us as managing editor 
            and I begin as editor. Ann worked tirelessly to expand the international 
            focus and spirit of the journal, remaining committed along the way to 
            local acts of experimentation and feminist practice. We are fortunate 
            to gain Dell’s considerable energies and experience as we renew <i>HOW2</i>’s 
            creatively challenging and necessarily adversarial project, and think 
            about the ongoing usefulness of internet journals as sites of play, 
            controversy and exchange. Roberta Sims continues as <i>HOW2</i>’s web-designer 
            and I would like to thank her for lending so much time and creative 
            input to the magazine. Finally and especially, thank you to founding 
            editor Kathleen Fraser for generous advice and assistance during <i>HOW2</i>’s 
            transitional months; to all associate editors and contributors who worked 
            on this issue; and to a growing community of readers, whose ideas always 
            direct our directions.</p>

          <p class="Doublespace">I was aware of the wasteland of potential plot 
            that lay outside the margins of my stories and the strange nature of 
            choice in the construction of a narrative.&nbsp; I used to spread the 
            final draft, sheet by sheet, on floors all over the house and move them 
            around.&nbsp; This way an eruption of action became a self-contained 
            section.&nbsp; But of course the floors and the air were bigger than 
            all those papers.</p>
