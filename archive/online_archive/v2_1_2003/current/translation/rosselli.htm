      <p class="ARTICLETEXT"><i>War Variations</i> is forthcoming Fall 
        2003 from Green Integer Press. It was originally published in Italian 
        as <i>Variazoni belliche</i> (Garzanti, 1964). The following poems, along 
        with others, are forthcoming in a new collection, <i>The Disappearing

      <P>O little swallow full of grace you invent your words and whistle<br>
                                                                                
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free 
        outside any plantation<br>
        with you I would dance far beyond the precise nests I would know<br>
        the indulgent summit. If the self-propelling<br>
        troubles keep coming, if rebellion must wither, if your feather falls<br>
                                                                                
                               to the ground<br>
        may I at least dream! indifference and may the<br>
        blond tyrannies (and may the madhouse)<br>
        look after your hot blast (your blond tyrannies). 
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Roberto, mother calls out, playfully rocking on the white<br>
        divan. I do not know<br>
        what God wants of me, serious<br>
        intentions rending eternity, or the frank laughter<br>
        of the puppet hanging from<br>
        the railing, railing yes, railing no, oh<br>
        postpone your heartfelt prayer with<br>
        a moving babble; car the dry and yellow leaves ravish<br>
        the wind that stirs them. Black vision tree that tends<br>
        toward the supreme power (pasture) which in fact I<br>
        think bleaches instead the ground beneath my feet, you are<br>
        my lover if the sky darkens, and the shiver<br>
        is yours, in the eternal forest. Empty city, full city, city<br>
        that soothes the fantastic for<br>
        the most part pain of the senses, you sit<br>
        sweltering after the meal you made of me, toy of leveling wind<br>
        from the coast I no longer dare<br>
        to face, I fear the red wave<br>
        of actually living, and the plants that say goodbye. Tom-<br>
        boy I straddle your bridges, and make them maybe<br>
        my own<br>
        nature.<br>
        I no longer know<br>
        who comes and who goes, let<br>
        delirium transform you into a senseless<br>
        gaming table, and the wild broom (room) faces out<br>
        spreading your sun across the reflecting glass.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>                                          And the dawning will be<br>
        that string of pearls you wear always untied on your pearly<br>
        thinning neck, o! the<br>
        muffled bones that<br>
        press in the excited dazed laughter. And you<br>
        will wear bandages on those tendons<br>
        snapped by the fury of loving<br>
        joyfully.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>                        And then he will adapt, to my new contingencies, 
        car<br>
        I have changed houses, I am no more the timid<br>
        flower hanging from the willows and I don’t want your tenderness<br>
        that I cruelly combat because I have no more<br>
        tenderness. If you wish to graze my grave with delicate hands<br>
        place an iron and weighty stone on the white slab that<br>
        covers me, and you will write<br>
        the line which completes<br>
        the intense comparison. I have no more wool in the ditch, nor<br>
        even the tender faith of one who touched your hand for the<br>
        understanding I no longer want, the moon is full enough, and she<br>
        carries on like a big sister, and her deadly beam I now devilishly<br>
        follow, that she may light the corners of being, upon a greeny pasture<br>
        where tomorrow’s dead row in a long-suffering<br>
        and cautious way. No more with you will I walk<br>
        your well-kept streets among the urnal graves, and the<br>
        dew might even burn my feet, I’ll sit me down and<br>
        laugh and spit on the honest faces of the young men murdered by your<br>
        order. If only there were not this cruelty of mine and others<br>
        those stretched-out legs, those nude and fragile backs<br>
        beneath the grass. You will not reach your goal, unless you<br>
        pass through my narrow and hard canals.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>                        I was, I flew, I fell trembling into the<br>
        arms of God, and may this last sigh<br>
        be my whole being, and may the wave reward,<br>
        held in difficult union, my blood,<br>
        and from that supreme deceit may death<br>
        become vermilion be given back to me, and I<br>
        who from the passionate brawls of my comrades plucked<br>
        that longing for death<br>
        will enjoy, finally— the age of reason;<br>
        and may all the white flowers along the shore, and<br>
        all the weight of God<br>
        beat upon my prisons.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>What is it with my heart that beats so softly<br>
        and desperate makes, maketh<br>
        the hardest soundings? you Those<br>
        tutories that I imprinted on afore he<br>
        tormented himself so<br>
        fiercely, and are vanished for him! O if mye<br>
        rabbits coursing throughthe nervies he for<br>
        frosty canals of the my lymph (o life)<br>
        they don’t stop, then yes, tha’ I, me<br>
        yetsaclose to they dead! In all sinceauity my soul<br>
        may you remedy it, I ambrace you, you,—<br>
        may you find der Softe Worde, may you return<br>
        to the fathomed tongue that allows love to stay.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>the carob of your thoughts<br>
        loosens violent and does not allow<br>
        that I tear him away from his<br>
        flashes of darkness. do not divert the<br>
        stone that makes us all able<br>
        to drink at a trickle of pity, do<br>
        not remove the ancient angels<br>
        from their pedestals of pity, and if<br>
        the opaque curtains of giant<br>
        warriors offend you, toss it all<br>
        in the sea, and save only the fly<br>
        that flies.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>the god who burns everything between pickup truck and pity, the<br>
        grand salami the grand universe oh you are one being with<br>
        such a keen point that I change color solely<br>
        considering you but the man with his variegated multicolored pains<br>
        (o grand variety of the whole!) traps<br>
        me in a relationship so increasing and so hard to bear so<br>
        extraordinarily guilty, that I delay any customary custom<br>
        because my customary senses have seen too much of the world spread<br>
        like a lot of flour, between mountains, beaches, trees, peaches, every<br>
                                                                                
                      kind of<br>
        saliva at your feet, and you who understand nothing and cannot (and<br>
        cannot ever) connect the variegated vicissitudes in a<br>
        single going in a single one of god’s plagues because<br>
        he hides behind the shadows.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>and what did that crowd want from my senses other than<br>
        my scorched defeat, or I who begged<br>
        to play with the gods and stumbled<br>
        like a poor whore up and down<br>
        the dark corridor— oh! wash my feet, take<br>
        the fierce accusations from my<br>
        bent head, bend<br>
        your accusations and undo all<br>
        my cowardice!: it wasn’t my wish to break the delicate layer of ice<br>
        not my wish to break the mounting battle, no, I swear, it wasn’t my<br>
        wish to break through your laughable<br>
        laughter!— but the hail has other reasons than<br>
        serving and the wet eastern wind of<br>
        evening does not dream of standing<br>
        watch by my<br>
        disenchanted lion sobs: no longer will I run<br>
        after every passage of beauty,— beauty is defeated, never again<br>
        at attention will I snuff out that fire now glimmering like<br>
        an old tree trunk<br>
        in which hollow swallows make nonsensical nests, child’s play,<br>
        unreckoning misery, unreckoning misery of sympathy.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>so that I may not fly, as long as you do not<br>
        fall, as long as the light become a whole<br>
        universe, that I may sleep, in the injured goodbye.<br>
        And may your playful Bridegroom’s outfit<br>
        cover you, may it be like the Only Supper for<br>
        Saints, your sighing without sleeping pills. There’s no light<br>
        without glory, and there is no hell<br>
        without defamation. The dry horizon<br>
        is a play of shadows: don’t follow it, don’t<br>
        throw the stone in the water,— that everything<br>
        may make do by itself, even in agonizing silence. </p>

       <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><strong>Bio:</strong><b> Amelia Rosselli</b> 
        was born in Paris in 1930 and died in Rome in 1996. She was the daughter 
        of one of the heroes of the Italian Resistance, Carlo Rosselli, assassinated 
        in Paris when Amelia was seven years old. She learned English when the 
        family escaped to England and later to the U.S. She returned to Europe 
        in 1946, first to study literature and music in London and later to settle 
        in the Rosselli family house in Florence. She continued her musical education 
        through the 1950s, developing an interest in ethnomusicology and electronic 
        music. She also wrote music theory. A short, intense friendship with the 
        southern poet and social activist Rocco Scotellaro inspired her to write 
        poetry. Her books include <i>Variazoni belliche</i> (1964), <i>Serie ospedaliera</i> 
        (1969), <i>Impromptu</i> (1981) and <i>Frammenti sparsi e persi: 1966-1997</i> 
        (1983). A volume of her collected poems was published in 1997.</p>
       
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Paul Vangelisti</b> 
    was born in San Francisco in 1945 and has lived in Los Angeles since 1968. 
    He is the author of some twenty books of poetry, as well as being a noted 
    translator from Italian. In 2001, his <i>Embarrassment of Survival: Selected 
    Poems, 1970-2000 </i>appeared from Marsilio/Agincourt in New York. From 1971-1982 
    he was co-editor of the award-winning literary magazine <i>Invisible City</i> 
    and, from 1993-2002, the editor of the visual and literary arts annual, <i>Ribot</i>. 
    He has twice been a recipient, in 1981 and 1988, of National Endowment for 
    the Arts Writing Fellowships. In his career as a journalist, Vangelisti worked 
    for <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> (1972-1974) and as Cultural Affairs Director 
    at KPFK Radio, Los Angeles (1974-1982). Since 1984, Vangelisti has taught 
    literature and writing at Otis College of Art &amp; Design, where he is currently 
    the Chair of the Graduate Writing Program.</p>
	<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Professor Lucia Re</b> earned her B.A. in English 
    at Smith College and her laurea in Languages and Literatures at the University 
    of Rome.  She received her M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Yale 
    University. She also studied Spanish and Latin-American literature at the 
    University of Puerto Rico. Her translation into Italian of <i>Borges: A Literary 
    Biography</i> by Emìr Rodriguez Monegal received the 1982 Comisso Prize.  
    Professor Re’s book <i>Calvino and the Age of Neorealism: Fables of Estrangement</i>  
    (Stanford 1990) was awarded the MLA Marraro prize for the best book in Italian 
    studies in 1990-92.  Lucia Re specializes in 19th and 20th-century Italian, 
    with an emphasis on the fin-de-siècle, early modernism and avant-garde, and 
    the cultural history of Italy under Fascism and during the Reconstruction.  
    Her current research and scholarly interests include the relationship between 
    Futurism, Fascism and feminism; gender issues in 19th-century and 20th century 
    literature and art; and comparative theories of gender and feminism, with 
    an emphasis on contemporary Italian feminist thought.  She has recently completed 
    a book entitled <i>Women and the Avant-Garde</i>. Her translation into English 
    (with Paul Vangelisti) of Amelia Rosselli’s first book of avant-garde poems, 
    <i>War Variations</i> (1964), is forthcoming in a bilingual edition with a 
    critical introduction. </p>
