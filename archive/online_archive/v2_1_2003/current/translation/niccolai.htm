        <p>The two armies face each other:<br>
          the one which has remained invisible<br>
          for millenniums and has come back into<br>
          light since a few decades,<br>
          advances imposingly in orderly columns.<br>
          There, under the huge hangar that<br>
          protects it, the “Terracotta Army”<br>
          deposits itself &#8212; in the mind’s eye &#8212;<br>
          as the majestic, unceasing march<br>
          of humanity. But the sacredness<br>
          of this image requires time to<br>
          sink in. We there, “extras”<br>
          in flesh and bone, too immersed<br>
          in the present, we visitors, too<br>
          talkative and hot, all of us,<br>
          too contemporary and thwarted<br>
          to perceive our tie with the past<br>
          and appear similar to them:<br>
          dignified, wise and measured.</p>

        <p><b>Mongolian Outpost</b></p>
        <p>Here, north of Datong, the Great Wall<br>
          is not massive slabs of stone, crenellated<br>
          and well maintained as it is near Peking,<br>
          it does not have the appearance of a castle or fortress.<br>
          Left to itself, it is only a succession<br>
          of humps of yellow clay<br>
          between fields of corn and potatoes: camel’s<br>
          humps drawn by a child.<br>
          Here already for half an hour, on the back seat<br>
          of a red and ramshackle taxi, perched<br>
          on one of the humps with a view<br>
          of the valley and the peasant village<br>
          &#8212; once a Mongolian outpost &#8212; I listen<br>
          with amusement, without understanding a word,<br>
          to the reciprocal confessions &#8212; in Chinese &#8212;<br>
          between the driver and the interpreter<br>
          who is a member of the Party.<br>
          I laugh, I laugh to myself because<br>
          the dynamics of life have chosen to show me<br>
          right here, how that mythical, universal<br>
          imaginary of the Great Wall and of China<br>
          &#8212; which has fed my mind for more than 50 years<br>
          together with a youthful love of adventure,<br>
          a hankering for something great and unknown,<br>
          for something superior and non-experienced,<br>
          with Ulysses and Marco Polo as favourite heroes &#8212;<br>
          should materialize in a situation<br>
          so comic and convivial, to be experienced<br>
          as a country picnic with its socially relaxed<br>
          ways: lemonade, a snack, chatting, friends.</p>
