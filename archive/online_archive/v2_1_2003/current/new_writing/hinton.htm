      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">1. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The cab driver picked me up near the station at the 
        other side of the avenue where the last driver told me I had to stand 
        if I wanted to go left.  Now I am on 28th Street going straight and an 
        officer who is GI Joe argues through the plate glass that goes down and 
        up.  <i>To reframe the direction of narrative is the crime, is my answer</i>.  
        Where did you pick her up?  He peaks through the plate glass to locate 
        me.  He sees my blondeness on 28th Street.  I am a socialite.  I am a 
        prostitute.  Who am I?  He has a GI Joe chest.  He is riding a plastic 
        Tonka tank.  The cab driver was nothing.  His lack was a softness that 
        would take my money, the plate glass separating his softness me from him. 
        <i>But where are you going?  What is the response to the power of capital</i>?  
        <i>Do you have a license, do you have a checkbook?  Let me see your writing. 
        What are you writing in that notebook?  Why are you writing and driving 
        in circles</i>?  He did not know why we leaned into the night.  We never 
        see the moon anyway.  We are going east.  The cab driver was going home, 
        I was going home, which is never East.  But that is not a crime, is my 
        answer.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">2.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">I have never had paranoia.  But now I know the danger 
        of a childhood left to pine cones<i>.  A genuine lack of paranoia that 
        is proper, enemies in an atmosphere in which one does not empty oneself 
        at proper zones.</i>  The feeling is to crave the proper object.  Transformed, 
        the object thus will perform as a witness.  <i>This story has a cell about 
        which the tender spider lays a spiraled egg before effusion wraps him 
        in a dry leaf.</i>  It was dry all summer in the South of France, and 
        now this emptiness.  No spiders no <i>l’hirondelle</i> circling the head 
        at night.  A hollow forms where soil depletes.  We crawl to taste the 
        earth. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">3.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">I am locked into narrative with the cab driver.  But 
        there is a disappointment in leaves, sordid and pee yellow. In the measure 
        of chronology, <i>I find that translation from the accurate to the symbolic 
        weighs the body in signs.  I loathe what they love.  They love me to hate.</i>  
        It is tempting to make a plot out of concrete directives.  But actions 
        are like symbols, too.  They disappear. Their lack is a softness, the 
        anomaly into which <i>the battered sign bathes the city.  The danger of 
        a childhood left to pine cones. </i></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The sentence is an example of squalor.  <i>Calling 
        it an example, to be squalor or a scholar, it makes no difference.  The 
        story of the cab driver that does not exist.  We flow with the ridges.</i>  
        We are obsessed with lyrics of time.  Worms, too, subdivide.  Taking action 
        internally, they make matter more.  <i>This story has a cell about which 
        the tender spider lays a spiraled egg before effusion wraps him in a dry 
        leaf.</i>  What is matter but self-replication, a matter of the zones 
        in which one empties oneself and, thus, becomes a function of the engine? 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">We try a solution.  Replace that, <i>as if “that” was 
        that fabrication along the bias.  We try for angles but they feel like 
        submission.  We move sideways, along the grain but also against what follows, 
        word for word thought for thought.  The text accumulates at a streaming 
        slant.  We are full with a revealing readiness and this becomes the lyric 
        passage.</i>  Formalists in showbiz, they<i> </i>cite no patterns at all.  
        But there is a disappointment in leaves, sordid and pee yellow. <i>I loathe 
        what they love and we mark that in temperament.  This is natural narrative. 
        It is tempting to make a plot out of concrete actions.  </i>The fabulist 
        sends grey balloons into the sky where they, too, are nothing.<i></i></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">4.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Our resistance to “necessary illusions<i>.</i>”<i>  
        But Chomsky, too, makes me still.</i>  Ill or still, I am absorbed by 
        passivity, which is not a resistance.  My blondeness is his nothingness 
        through the plate glass.  I ask him <i>Are you often stopped by GI Joe 
        do you often write to madness?</i>  His answer mimics the repetition of 
        all I have done. <i> What accounts for this movement, the leaving to stillness 
        that I do not feel or hear?</i>  I do not wish to be left on 28th Street 
        so <i>the daughter is moved into the solidity of history. </i> This reluctance 
        for dialogue, it gives a function to the engine. The danger of a childhood 
        left to pine cones.  All categories are in flux when one listens.<i> </i></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE2"><i>     it was the same grey grandmother who stood 
        at beige Venetian blinds saying rain</i> <br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rain

        her</i><br>

        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to 
        this spatial chaos    large and tinted, fringed with palms it was a world 
        so<br>

        that i forgot to wear underwear and my dress showed in the cafeteria </i><br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i 
        was only 5, so my grey grandmother was not alarmed   i registered this 
        early</i><br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indifference 
        and remembered the fish   full of people grey and beige the place</i><br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bore 
        a watery allusion    we passed the carousel   i didn’t know there would 
        be a</i><br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;childhood 
        left to pine cones</i></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">I move toward the cab driver and compromise the pieces<i>.  
        </i>I dreamed that the cab driver comes back but that the cab was empty.<i>  
        The dream does not match the reality of the dream</i>.  She took the cab 
        when it was still full, in the dream, and when it was emptied she felt 
        vulnerable.  The dream was an expression of her paranoia.  <i>I have never 
        had a paranoia.  But the narrative tells me that this is an empty cab.</i>  
        The cab driver was nothing.  He is unhappy.  I am unhappy, too.  I pay 
        to see <i>India Song</i> and I find that it is a bore.  Like Marguerite 
        Duras, there is this reluctance for dialogue.  The story is a cab driver 
        left without an engine. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">5.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Is she the daughter the bold or the daughter the good?  
        <i>Will the bad daughter love the cab driver who is nothing?  The cab 
        driver is not the cop. </i> But this, the narrative, intends a secret 
        authority, forcing us to action.  Will they reign her in?  <i>She would 
        like to buy her aunt a plane ticket for the East to see the leaves. </i> Narrative 
        will imitate the daughter’s split.  <i>But there is a disappointment in 
        the leaves, sordid and pee yellow.</i>  Narrative is not a tearing but 
        a concave rolling form.  A rolling voluptuous bird bobs its head in and 
        out and back against the distant bridge.  <i>Divisive, worms make matter 
        more.</i>  Narrative is not like the worm, a soft earthen mass.  Narrative 
        is dry and lean and sinewy.  It chews.  A hollow forms where soil depletes.</p>

          gills as gullible as fish in the captured state?   there was always

      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">She wrote this story to demonstrate a suction device.  
        But the men were sleeping so the demonstration lapsed.  Severance pay 
        bought wine and pâté but for the cab driver there was nothing<i>.</i>  
        He pulled up in an empty cab.  <i>They were casting flies and hoped not 
        to hook any more progeny</i>.  <i>The danger of a childhood left to pine 
        cones.</i></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">6.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The suction action creates a crevasse. <i> She walked 
        into the room to face a handicap, the strangers bearing equipment with 
        names.</i>  Today in the paper she read about the death of the historian 
        who proved that Dracula was actually real.  Only Romanian tourist offices 
        pretended to believe him, a bloodthirsty count from the 14th century sucking 
        her story.  Why turn to the obituaries first?  Then there is the business 
        page, the story of silicon.  Light-bearing, it is like the mica, the cab 
        driver, <i>like narrative, it is nothing.</i>  The suction failed but 
        the story moves in pieces.  The cab was empty when it stopped on 28th 
        Street.  It was the cab driver who was nothing who left the dream sinking.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><i>Was blondeness an excuse or a crime?  </i>The daughter 
        imagined it was the presence of dialogue, their voices, that made him 
        stop.  She mediated anxiety and the two escaped.  The GI Joe puffed up 
        his plastic chest, and said good-day ma’am — but was that real? <i>What 
        I have noticed about philosophers is that they all ride Tonka tanks</i>.  
        <i>Philosophers are related to suction devices</i>.  A choice between 
        loving the cab driver and loving the cop.  They were casting flies hoping 
        not to hook any more progeny.  There are the leaves, a disappointment 
        in sordid and pee yellow.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE2"><i>                   feeling the onset of a crime, 
        she asked her father how to gut fish   he demonstrated</i><br>
        <i>                   on the kitchen sink   the fish guts blood spewing 
        over black enamel sink then</i><br>
        <i>                   suction down the drain   she told her father that 
        now she could now live in the</i><br>
        <i>                   forest and be a boy   her father was sorry he had 
        demonstrated anything   so the</i><br>
        <i>                   daughter might use it, the boy’s story was not her 
        father’s fish story   nor was it</i><br>
        <i>                   him or her   the story blackened the sink with gills 
        and guts   like her father,</i><br>
        <i>                   gender was rewarded when her mother chased a bear 
        with a steak   the fire lit, the</i><br>
        <i>                   mother took a gas tank and flung it flaming up at 
        the stars   it hit the creek an</i><br>
        <i>                   exploding anvil in the days before horrific tragedies 
        would occur and we would</i><br>
        <i>                   worry   so i asked: what if my mother was not him 
        but her?   the tribe was</i><br>
        <i>                   severely marked by the blood-blackened hand   the 
        bright soot was not to be</i><br>
        <i>                   recalled for many generations    only when, a baby 
        in arms, i was camping one</i><br>
        <i>                   night in a mound of pine cones near the Four Corners 
        under clusters of stars    </i></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">This time she thought the tale would tell.  She gave 
        the fragments back to the childhood left to pine cones.  <i>Two competing 
        narratives distort or reframe their reference</i>.  So as to not make 
        the tale too familiar she rubbed out the edges of the lines  The pen smeared 
        the purple ink flowed the blood whitened the black sink  It was an emptiness 
        that was the cab and the cab driver.  But we have his legacy to consider.  
        It is tempting to make a plot out of concrete actions.  Narrative never 
        compensates for itself.<i>  Something’s gone wrong, the daughter’s crime 
        reads like a fish story.</i>  She considered the details.  <i>She has 
        details,</i> said her friend in Spanish.  This means that the daughter 
        always thinks of little moments and that makes her good.  <i>And what 
        does that mean, if the crime of the daughter turned out to be really good? 
        </i></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">What does it mean to replicate oneself in a dream?  
        Last night, I was the good daughter again, in love not with his softness 
        but with the hardness of Bill Clinton.  He was 7 feet high in person in 
        the dream, and I kissed him and to do so he had to hold me sharply up.  
        <i>Keeping the narrative as hard as rock rubbing without erasing the edges.</i>  
        Maybe in life she had loved the cab driver.  But in the dream she loved 
        Bill Clinton.  Big and powerful and male, he gave her his tall narrative.  
        With the cab driver she would have continued going sharply East, and there 
        would have been sand burgers and sunshine at Coney Island.  But in her 
        love for Bill Clinton she committed a crime.  She was testing out the 
        daughter’s penchant for submission.  I know the danger of a childhood 
        left to pine cones.  <i>The danger, the green Tonka tanks turned in a 
        blue meadow, a plastic GI Joe dangling on wings.</i></p>

  <p class="doublespace">To think about my husband’s face resembling Jack Nicholson’s 
    in the pillow and wanting to witness it but having his head turned against 
    me</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To want to watch <i>Five Easy Pieces</i> again to get the allusion 
    to the scene with the Omaha waitress that was deleted from the final film 
    cut</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To disagree with the editor-director about one of the deleted 
    scenes but not this one, and to not remember why I disagreed</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To nevertheless feel puffed up in the early morning, like I 
    should have been a film maker</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To wish I could fly to Rapid City next weekend to do research 
    for my novel as if I could write it this summer and escape the rain</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To disagree with the <i>New York Times</i> writer who says that 
    Lewis Carroll was not a paedophile without reading the article about this</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To worry about paedophiles in general while looking at Lewis 
    Carroll’s photograph of a little girl sleeping like Olympia on a couch in 
    the <i>Times</i>, only with clothes on (one shoulder of her bodice down), 
    which may be the difference between England and France in the 19th century</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To worry that people are attacking psychoanalytic thinking as 
    if Freudians are all Freudians as if they are all alike</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think about the two editors at the <i>Times</i> who had to 
    resign because a reporter invented the news</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To remember that there were two editors at the Tucson papers 
    who were caught in an explosion and that one died</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To remember that the other one had recently just before the 
    explosion refused to give me a job which is why I stayed in school and which 
    is why I went on to get a Ph.D. because I had nothing better to do and to 
    know that now I am living an entirely different life</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To read the traumatic life stories of Ph.D.s from the ’90s in 
    the<i> Chronicle of Higher Education</i> and to realize that the stories are 
    all about men</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To wonder what it would be like to have my stories recorded 
    in the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think that we have to do the laundry and to go to Walmart 
    for a cheap plastic table to use in the garden after it stops raining</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To sign up for another Human Rights organization on the web 
    because I can’t be in the garden because it is raining</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To want to speak in lines of poetry but to be forced to speak 
    in prose</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To desire in the infinitive mood as is deflecting a bad mood 
    because it is raining</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To desire to defer deflecting</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think about all those people in the laundromat today and 
    in the Walmart in Kingston</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To remember a time when I would never set foot in a Walmart 
    in Kingston or a Walmart anywhere for that matter, until one boring day Bernard 
    and I drove to the Kingston mall and played ball in the aisles of the Walmart 
    sports department</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think that just five squares of organic semi-sweet chocolate 
    could make me sick</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To know I need a cheap plastic table from Walmart to write on 
    in the garden whenever it stops raining</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think that tomorrow morning there will be clouds and I will 
    not watch the new light through the forest on the garden created by Bernard 
    cutting down half the trees</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To yell at a deer who is eating the tree leaves in the forest 
    now that the trees are on the ground</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think I used to like deer before I had a garden, and that 
    I would lay my Arrow book edition of Bambi next to my father’s bedside the 
    night before he would go hunting in Rapid City</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think that my Coral Bells might get over-watered</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think I am watching tropical fish swimming on my screen saver 
    and wishing I were there</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To forget every time I dig in the dirt that there will be roots 
    and rocks, rocks and roots, and that digging in the dirt will be agony</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To remember that every time only after the fact like a ritual</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To let Bernard go to the laundromat alone because five squares 
    of semi-sweet chocolate made me sick</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To wonder how I can write poetry if I can’t hold a pen</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think about <i>About Schmidt</i> again and the rhythm of 
    film like poetry, and that flattening of space and culture requiring such 
    delicate decisions about pace — and to wonder how one might do all that while 
    still remaining “inside” the poem or film </p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think that one must remain inside and out at the same time, 
    an impossibility</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think that that is the act that I have in common with a couple 
    of poets I know</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To imagine that it is not raining</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To wish for a kiddie pool from Walmart</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To wish the rain would stop, like in the old days</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To wish for a poetry full of chaos and the appearance of light 
    as if actual light without the sheer beauty</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To wonder why everyone likes the poem with the conventional 
    ending and how I scorn that notion of “beauty” even though I wrote it</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To think again about <i>About Schmidt</i>, which has so entirely 
    affected me, and to wonder if I could drive across the highways of Nebraska 
    and South Dakota like in the old days</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To drive and to sweat and to wait for what my mother always 
    called “the viaduct” so we could stop and cool off in the highway in the 100 
    degrees in the shade pooled over the baking asphalt</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To see nothing but asphalt and flat fields</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To drive onward through the Badlands and to realize they were 
    really ugly but fascinating and to not have a clue as to where the Badlands 
    began and ended</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To just stop at a place and call it “the Badlands” sometime 
    in my childhood</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To take road trips with my mom</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To wish I hadn’t become so delicate and could take road trips 
    with a tent</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To love every frame of a movie as if it were a moment</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To let a movie remind me of detail</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To let the detail be the rhythm of the poem like a movie</p>
