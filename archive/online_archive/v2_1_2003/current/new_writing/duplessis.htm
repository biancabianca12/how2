      <p><span>a phone call one day after</span></p>
      <p><span>asking</span></p>
      <p><span>for the newly-stark</span></p>
      <p><span>by name</span></p>
      <p><span>someone</span></p>
      <p><span>identifying herself by the
        exact same</span></p>
      <p><span>“I want to talk </span></p>
      <p><span>to her” the phone said</span></p>
      <p><span>of the dead woman</span></p>
      <p><span>because she had</span></p>
      <p><span>to track </span></p>

      <p><span>between—crossed medical </span></p>

      <p><span>information relayed</span></p>
      <p><span>confusion</span></p>
      <p><span>to doctors, some tedious-impt
        thread,</span></p>
      <p><span>because they had the exact

      <p><span>“Can I talk to her?</span></p>
      <p><span>I have questions”</span></p>
      <p><span>the voice said.</span></p>
      <p><span>12. Only later (one of those<br>

        </span><span>did the receiver ask<br>
        </span><span>            who was making that call<br>
        </span><span>anyway?<br>
        </span><span>            After all, she had always wanted <br>
        </span><span>to be organized,<br>
        </span><span>            she had wanted, a point of pride,<br>
        </span><span>not to leave<br>
        </span><span>            things in a mess—<br>
        </span><span>she had labelled everything with messages,<br>
        </span><span>            she had set folders stacked,<br>
        </span><span>she had tacked observations<br>
        </span><span>            ‘old camera—possibly valuable<br>
        </span><span>but lets in too much light’—<br>
        </span><span>            onto a lot of wrack:<br>
        </span><span>why had I—in my disbelief—<br>
        </span><span>            hung up so abruptly?<br>
        </span><span>The call came in under the radar,<br>
        </span><span>            uncanny.<br>
        </span><span>But then I realized what had happened<br>
        </span><span>            and wanted—but had gotten no number—<br>
        </span><span>to return the call,<br>
        </span><span>            to call her back.</span></p>

      <p><u><span>Notes to Draft 44</span></u><span>: Stretto. Many images from
        responding to the paintings in the Etruscan tombs of Tarquinia which I
        first saw in August 1999; the poem was also thereby making a deliberate
        connection to Kathleen Fraser’s “Etruscan Pages.” I wanted to register
        the impact of the fiore di loto ceilings, and especially of the Tomba
        dei Giocolieri (the dancer balancing a giant candlestick and the red-dotted
        dancer), Tomba Cardarelli (with the game called “kottabos,” played by
        men, of throwing wine against the wall), Tomba delle Leonesse (male and
        female dancers, lactating lionesses), Tomba de Caronti (blue hammer-carrying
        Charun), Tomba dei Leopardi (with the banquet, the white and red-bronze
        bodies of women and men, and the double-flute player), and Tomba del Triclinio
        (with the male dancer in blue). “Mignonne, allons voire si la rose” is
        the beginning of a carpe diem poem by Ronsard. Wine language from Fattoria
