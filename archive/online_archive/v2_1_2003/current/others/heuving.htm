        <P CLASS="TITLE1">Inappropriated Others</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perhaps there is nothing more reassuring to existing 
          social orders than a love story in which boy pursues girl and they live 
          happily ever after.  This romance plot has been criticized by multiple 
          feminist, and now queer, critics—not only for how it is gendered, but 
          also for how it authorizes heteropatriarchy.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Yet, while it is easy to criticize this 
          plot for how it typically produces gender and sexuality, what about love 
          itself?  Is the very plot of a lover intensely pursuing a beloved inherently 
          retrogressive?    Many psychologists and cultural theorists, particularly 
          those who study object relations theories, would seem to wish to correct 
          for intense, obsessive love through an emphasis on relations of reciprocity 
          and exchange.   And, many avant garde writers attempt to void positionality 
          itself, opting for an erotics of language.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            But is this cultural transformation so 
          simply in the offing?  Or even desirable?  Roland Barthes in <i>A Lover’s 
          Discourse</i> responds to this dilemma by turning a lover’s heightened 
          utterances into an array of discourses.  He would seem to want to have 
          it both ways, inscribing intense love declarations, singularly experienced 
          and delivered; yet dispersing (if multiplying) their energies by arranging 
          them as fragments through alphabetized topics.   Taking his discourses 
          from some of the most revered literary sources from classical times onwards, 
          Barthes barely hints at the difference his own homosexuality might make 
          to these writings. Nor does he address the complex cultural and historical 
          realities from which these love writings are produced, side stepping political 
          and social issues in order to locate an entirely delicious love, “warranted 
          by no one.”  </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            The writers in this section actively 
          take on the position of a lover besotted by a beloved.  And, in each piece, 
          the writers transgress those lover and beloved relations that serve to 
          underwrite existing social orders.  This happens, in part, because each 
          lover is not a heterosexual male who through his love for his female beloved 
          constitutes his literary authority.  But also, perhaps more importantly, 
          the lovers are drawn to inappropriate beloveds—engaging in intense acts 
          of inappropriation. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            In his pursuit of the elusive Australian 
          pop singer, Kylie Minogue, Kevin Killian extols her precisely because 
          she “will never win any awards, for nothing.”  Kylie “is a second-or third-rate 
          talent more precious than any of a number of big time genuises.”   In 
          his familiar patois, eschewing the proper in all its manifestation, including 
          stately diction, Kevin decamps his own camp gestures, attempting to keep 
          Kylie from being consumed by a culture-making machine—or at least keeping 
          a place within cultural formation that doesn’t overwrite unsettling desires 
          through an appropriating, finely wrought expression.  Speaking of himself 
          and other gay admirers of Kylie, Kevin writes, “Kylie fans re-settle the 
          unsettling haunt of sexuality by our insistence on customization—adapting, 
          subverting its broad strikes to our own homey use.  It’s this impulse—gears 
          shifting downward from public to private—that Kylie understands and illuminates 
          beautifully… there’s an empty, spooky sigh at the heart of this work.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Dodie Bellamy also takes on an inappropriate 
          other—only to deliver him and her female narrator, Carla Moran, to further 
          inappropriation.  In having a relationship with a man she met through 
          email, Carla, a poet, meditates on how this relationship is “writing made 
          flesh.”  Attempting initially to disguise her love connection with Ed 
          from even casual bystanders—because he is fat—Lala, as Carla is sometimes 
          called, comes to identify with him: “I watch fat men now, this secret 
          ostracized world of ridicule and invisibility.  I feel scorn for the mainstream, 
          the hip, the cool.”  As Ed comes to distance himself from Carla, the narrative 
          exfoliates into brilliant phantasmagoric passages in which Lala explores 
          what it means to be rejected by the culturally abjected:  “I dreamt I 
          was having trouble shitting and began pulling whole cabbage leaves out 
          my butt.  I showed them to Ed and he said I needed to chew my food better…. 
          The specially attuned don’t realize I’m a ghost—until one day they wake 
          up and the mansion we’ve been flirting through is burnt out and strewn 
          with leaves.  A little girl in an antique dress leads Ed to my tombstone.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Christine Stewart pursues an inverse 
          strategy to Kevin and Dodie, telling how her anonymity, her illicit love, 
          constitutes St. Augustine’s holy reverence. She draws attention to how 
          his cultural dignity and power are constituted through her “lush obscurity,” 
          remarking “I did not kill your corrupt authority—I gave it life.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">She addresses St. Augustine:</p>
        <p style='line-height:150%'>            Do you recognize your own unique 
          cupidity,</p>
        <p style='line-height:150%'>            your over-souled package</p>
        <p style='line-height:150%'>            that central radiating genitalia,</p>
        <p style='line-height:150%'>            that generates mutiny in my vehicle. 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">She breaks down his dignified removal by “moving 
          towards” him:  “St Augustine, if you speak the words father or kitchen 
          / you will split the sides of your mouth./  Instead I will kiss the sides 
          of your mouth.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Roland Barthes concludes <i>A Lover’s 
          Discourse</i> by considering the subject of  “<i>vouloir-saisir / </i>will-to-possess.”  
          Quoting Nietzsche, he writes, &quot;I do not want to replace the intense 
          throes of passion by ‘an impoverished life, the will-to-die, the great 
          lassitude.’ The N.W.P [the non-will-to-possess] is not on the side of 
          kindness, the N.W.P. is intense, dry….”   While if in the concluding section 
          of his book, Barthes offers a number of sublime considerations to the 
          issue of how possessive or non-possessive one should be with respect to 
          one’s beloved, he does quite clearly state how overly chastened desire 
          may not be “on the side of kindness.”    And here “kindness” should be 
          read, as a dispensation of the subject toward others, toward kind through 
          kindness.  If there is one quality that all three inappropriating writings 
          in this section share it is their kindness toward,  rather than binary 
          differentiation from, the others they pursue.</p>
