      <P CLASS="TEXT"><i><strong>for Casey McKinney</span></strong></i></P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Ed-thoughts keep banging around inside my skull <i>Ed 
        and I step out of the black and white of e-mail and into the Fairmont’s 
        floral mauves and teals</i> I close my mouthhole, hoping the Ed-thoughts 
        will suffocate, but they frizzle and hiss, whoosh out through noseholes 
        <i>I can’t believe he would stop loving me</i> I snort like a moose <i>my 
        absolute belief in our fused magic </i>so now I’m typing, hoping to lock 
        the Ed-thoughts in a file, maybe I could print it out and burn it, maybe 
        that would rid me of them <i>his body felt solid yet puffy, like a water 
        balloon, I loved the way clean cotton slid so easily across his massive 
        flesh</i> my keystrokes are the click of heels on a mausoleum floor—the 
        vowels are all the same, it’s the consonants that change <i>mrbl mrbl</i> 
        I make puddles to stay alive.  Rejection is such a prickly emotion, you 
        breathe it in as something transparent, but inside you it condenses, hardens, 
        takes on pointed geometric shapes between your organs.  A cock can gouge 
        the soul right out of your pussy, but I’ve heard the soul grows back, 
        slowly, like a lizard’s tail, I’m counting on that.  He told me I was 
        “fantastic.”  Fantastic—a word which darts about braying and sputtering 
        like a jackass, a fucking jackass.  Oh, I’m such a bitter girl <i>hollow 
        mush of mouth and tongue</i> what are words without an audience, what 
        is a woman without an audience <i>bitter herbs relieve constipation</i> 
        I dream I’m a stone skittering across a cold marble floor.  This happens 
        in a corridor so I must still believe in linearity.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Back to 1996: After months of email and dirty talk 
        on my turquoise Princess phone, I’m finally going to set eyes on him.  
        I’m at SFO, sitting on a ledge to the side of the security check station, 
        nervous, chatting with two midwestern women about weather and airports, 
        ladies in crisp white skirts and sandals.  “It’s cooler here than in Nebraska.”  
        From down the hallway, a stream of rumpled people gushes towards us, lugging 
        carry-ons, none of them Ed, then finally he walks past the metal detectors, 
        large and squishy, swelling about the middle in black pants and a dark 
        brown shirt, tucked in, I recognize him from his photo but I’m shocked 
        at how round he is.  The dark clothes make him look like an eggplant, 
        an excitedly smirking eggplant, his mouth a slit splitting his big pale 
        face in two, soft fringe of black curls <i>kind of femmy</i> what to do 
        about the issue of touch—fluorescent airport air, colorless indoor/outdoor 
        carpeting, Ed in his dark brown shirt scanning the area, an eggplant lost 
        in a wasteland—I stand and wave.  No sign of recognition, so I run up, 
        “Hi, it’s me.”  He laughs.  “Sweetie, I can’t believe I couldn’t find 
        you.”  He reaches out and I give him a quick hug, no kiss, so that maybe 
        the Nebraskan women will think he’s just a friend.  “Let’s get your luggage,” 
        I say.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When we get down to the baggage claim he hugs me 
        again, his body’s soft with lumps at unexpected places, like I’m embracing 
        a rag doll whose stuffing has shifted.  He hunches down and kisses me, 
        gently, but I remain stiff, unresponsive.  He looks much younger than 
        33, he could be a boy.  We lean against a chrome railing and stare at 
        the oval baggage carousel, a series of triangular metal plates shifting 
        at weird angles, endlessly standing there in public, tentatively rubbing 
        pinky fingers against one another, then sliding closer, arm pressing against 
        arm, his soft dense heat, the dissonance of so much information, so much 
        emotion, so many orgasms projected upon this foreign body whose fingers 
        are now stroking my hand, harder and faster, chrome railing indenting 
        our asses.  The baggage carousel’s jerky revolutions.  Many of our fantasies 
        have centered on fucking in a rental car, as soon as we get in the mid-sized 
        Honda he leans over and really kisses me.  Twenty minutes later we’re 
        still making out around the gear shift.  I pull back and say, “Don’t you 
        think we should like, leave the parking lot?”  He drives with his left 
        hand, with his right he reaches over and tweaks my nipple, then he moves 
        his hand between my legs, rubs my cunt through my black dress, wet spot 
        of pre-cum on the front of his Dockers.  My clit gets hard as I write 
        this, not because he was so good, but because he was so strange.  I wasn’t 
        attracted to him one iota, yet I submitted to him, it was thrilling, so 
        Story of O.  I did not know the hulk beside me.  “Play with my cock,” 
        he barked and I reached over, green rectangular exit signs whooshing by.  
        We didn’t talk much.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I know I liked kissing his lips, soft, pillow-like.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It’s mid-afternoon when we arrive in San Jose, Ed’s 
        hand still wriggling in my crotch.  I marvel at the clean and manicured 
        downtown, its broad pavements creamy as mother of pearl.  We check in 
        at the Fairmont then ride the elevator to the fourth floor.  It takes 
        forever for the bellman to deposit our luggage.  We hover awkwardly around 
        the two huge beds in the center of the room.  Ed pulls back a stiff quilted 
        cover.  “Ready?”  We lie down beneath its vaguely biomorphic design and 
        sex until it’s dark out.  I rub my face against his breasts, reach my 
        arms around his fat belly, he feels like a tribal fertility figure, both 
        tits and a cock—I suck on him until my cheeks collapse.  He tweaks and 
        turns my nipples, saying let’s turn up the volume, let’s balance the channels.  
        To our right a wall of windows, heavy light-blocking drapes glide open, 
        beneath them a layer of sheer white gauzes the skyline.  Free from all 
        context beyond our charged, leaking bodies, we tumble slowly through the 
        Fairmont’s muted color scheme, teal, apricot, rose.  I have to put a pillow 
        under my ass to endure his breadth, his initial slow heaves shifting to 
        rhythmic slamming, thighs spread achingly wide my whole body lunges with 
        each thrust, and then he bellows and collapses on me THUD I am a pancake 
        with bulging eyes, red tongue dangling to one side.  Ed kisses me and 
        with our lips still touching, whispers, “I love you.”  A barely audible 
        whisper <i>I love you</i> his lips pooching and parting against my lips, 
        it’s as if he’s feeding me the words.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Around nine that evening we get up, woozy, and walk 
        to the Italian cafe around the corner.  The streetlights sparkle like 
        crystal.  Both of us are too nervous, too amniotic to eat much of our 
        pizza margherita.  Ed hunches over the white-clothed table, mutely clinging 
        to my hand, inert, smooth, his back rounded as a Henry Moore sculpture, 
        I want to climb on top of him, sprawl there, child-limp, unleashing the 
        full weight of my body, warmed by the warmth of sun-warmed stone.  Still 
        I’m embarrassed to be seen in public with him <i>the fat man with the 
        mooning eyes.</i>  “Ed, you’re so quiet!”  He says he doesn’t know what 
        to say, that he was used to silence due to his deaf parents.  “Were they 
        born that way?”  “Spinal meningitis.  My father was three and had already 
        learned to speak.  Said he could remember what sound was like.”  “And 
        what was it like?”  “I don’t know, he was such an asshole.  My mother 
        was only a year old when she got sick.  Silence, or whatever it is that 
        goes on inside her head—you know, John Cage—is all she’s ever known.”  
        “You mean like silence as noise?”  “Yeah, Sweetie, you got it.”  He squeezes 
        my hand and hypergrins, silky skin stretched over his hefty cheeks.  My 
        clit is so excited it glows in the dark <i>sex uranium.</i>  “My mother 
        was frightened of hearing people, she was like this little mouse huddled 
        in our living room, everything covered with plastic, and so am I, a mouse.  
        I need to be inside you.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I loved our hotel room—small flat bottles of Neutrogena 
        soap in the shower, pale amber, the glass door, the sink lined with pill 
        bottles, burnt orange, bathtub, built-in vanity in the dressing room, 
        Hollywood globe lights lining a huge mirror, me sitting on the wide padded 
        stool putting on make-up, the hush of wall-to-wall carpeting, my movements 
        are so slow they’re almost imperceptible, a series of stop frames dissolving 
        into one another, his loose shit exploding into the toilet and then the 
        air, my impulse is to retch, I suppress it, kiss his guilty face.  His 
        suitcase open on the floor, cotton shirts spilling over the sides.  In 
        the mornings Ed went down to the database convention DownWorld had sent 
        him to and I’d lay in bed dreaming and reading, this messy left-over from 
        the day before.  The maids must have hated me.  At lunch he’d climb back 
        in bed with sandwiches, and we’d kiss and belly-rub, his cock snaking 
        through the folds of his Dockers, breadcrumbs and mayonnaise gunking the 
        sheets.  Then I’d spend the afternoon sauntering through San Jose’s mall-like 
        downtown, writing in my diary <i>arousal mixed with pangs of What Am I 
        Doing Here,</i> drinking white wine while listening to the grand piano 
        in the Fairmont’s cavernous lounge, lots of gold and foliage.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>San Jose Fairmont Lounge, 7-9-96</b>—Everyone’s 
          wearing suits and high heels and I feel like a frump.  A giant fichus 
          is looming over me, a pony-tailed pianist is playing “My Funny Valentine.”  
          So here I am, finally, with Ed—words, hair, semen, blood.  We ordered 
          room service this morning, and as we were eating I thought of our intimate 
          emails, how writing abstracts life into words, but this is the opposite 
          of writing, this is writing made flesh.  I wonder how the writing feels 
          about this turnabout, if it resents it.  In movies characters are always 
          leaping off the page into the material world, solid, breathing, wreaking 
          havoc—like Freddy Krueger or even in that drecky Woody Allen comedy 
          where Mia Farrow is the small town fan.  Perhaps all return-from-the-grave/haunting 
          plots are really about writing incarnating, moving from the safe realm 
          of fantasy into treacherous life.  Suddenly to be involved in all this 
          fucking, love, romance.  It reminds me of those android movies where 
          the creature is born full-grown with memories and feelings implanted 
          in its circuitry.  I sat on the toilet and wiped myself and there on 
          the toilet paper was a long black hair.  He has the longest pubic hair 
          I’ve ever seen.  Fingering it I call him, “Rapunzel.”  He’s not being 
          dirty with me at all like we’ve been in letters and on the phone.  In 
          life he’s sweet, considerate, rather quiet.  God, is my cunt sore.  
          And my inner thigh muscles so stretched I feel bow-legged.  I wish he 
          would talk more during sex.  I feel little physically when he fucks 
          me, none of that intense connection that makes you want to kill to get 
          it.  He doesn’t really know how to connect sexually, body to body.  
          The kissing is better, lying together, this incredible loving energy 
          bouncing back and forth between us like a ping pong ball.  Lots of shyness 
          and awkwardness at first—now I feel as if I could stay with him forever.</span></p>
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>San Jose, 7-11-96—</b>Yesterday he snuck me 
          into the computer conference lunch buffet.  A zillion computer programmers 
          in polo shirts, the collars and sleeves of the polo shirts trimmed with 
          contrasting colors, all these men dedicated to interactive databases—we 
          were standing in line and Ed said to me, “I’m not used to not being 
          able to touch you.”  It was a whimper—so primal.  He likes to be held 
          the way my cats like to be held when they’re freaked out—submitting 
          completely like I’m the Virgin Mary of safety.  He’s so stunningly beautiful 
          and interesting.  I watch fat men now, this secret ostracized world 
          of ridicule and invisibility.  I feel scorn for the mainstream, the 
          hip, the cool.  I can’t believe he’s going home tomorrow.</span></p>
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>San Francisco, 7-19-96—</b>A week since San 
          Jose.  This is the first morning since we got involved that I’ve woken 
          and there wasn’t an email from Ed, and this is the first morning I can 
          remember since I “went under” in March where I am struck with the simple 
          beauty of my life, my pale green dotted Swiss comforter, my geometrically-etched 
          drinking glasses.  Things have been strained between us since he went 
          back to Chicago.  Clearly he’s distancing from me, which hurts, but 
          it’s for the best—I need to separate from him.  His total impotence 
          the last couple of days was intolerable—and makes any continued long-distance 
          sexual involvement ludicrous.  I need to start reclaiming my life, to 
          be productive.  I need a more meditative state, to read, to think, to 
          take notes.  All my systems, my schedules have fallen apart since March.  
          I stopped brushing my teeth and flossing like I should.  I stopped misting 
          the plants.  I never unpacked my suitcase from my February trip to Los 
          Angeles.  This romance has been wonderful but cancerous, eating all 
          my energy.  It’s hard to let go of.  I’ve been in mourning ever since 
          we left San Jose.  It’s not the same as what we had before—our innocent 
          onrush of desire and excitement has degenerated into this grudging, 
          guarded thing.  My sweet pure baby that I trusted with my soul is becoming 
          a straight male, pulling out that bag of tricks.  No wonder I’ve been 
          teary-eyed.  I think my days of being a sexual amazon are over.  Any 
          wonderful connection we did have happened when we were lying together, 
          or when we were out experiencing The World together, holding hands, 
          perhaps quietly talking.  Last night I left an urgent message, “I’ve 
          got to talk to you!”  I called and called and when I finally got through, 
          around 9:30, he said he didn’t call me back because he had to pay his 
          bills, do the laundry.  The washing machine’s in the basement of his 
          building.  He says he’s totally out of touch with his libido, that he 
          tried masturbating yesterday and failed.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Who’d believe that in less than two months I’d hurl 
        myself back into his roly-poly arms.  Six weeks in Chicago.  What was 
        I thinking?  I tossed my body about as if it were a dress, the skin mere 
        fabric wrapped around pulp.  No brains.  The woman Ed was in love with 
        is inaccessible to me—a sex goddess he called her, this raw ethereal creature.  
        His silence during phone sex, I’d beg him to speak, but the line would 
        remain dead save for his rapid exhalations and the slapping of fist against 
        cock—he was with <i>her</i> then, a space bitch with three tits and fangs.  
        Ed and She didn’t need words—thought waves, breath waves were their units 
        of transmission, impulses shooting directly from her cunt into his bloodstream.  
        When I arrived on his doorstep, my flesh a thick, sloppy shield, he lost 
        her, his true alien mate.  I unbutton my blouse a bit and lean over but 
        Ed averts his eyes from my cleavage.  It is then I know he’s an alien—like 
        the man who suddenly stops smoking, like the lame man who can suddenly 
        walk without a cane.  Or any man unwilling to take off his shirt and show 
        me his back.  During a manic episode an evolved being from another dimension 
        entered Ed’s body, and that’s why he got fat—to protect it.  Aliens puff 
        up right before our eyes, mature in a matter of days or even minutes.  
        Under a microscope their cells reproduce wildly, hysterically, jigging 
        around.  Aliens have an obscene passion for life, they are so lowclass 
        in that regard.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Hong Kong, 6-11-98—</b>I’m in the back, waiting 
          for my wine, surrounded by fatties, working class blacks whites Latinos, 
          leather daddies, nerds, crazies.  The Hong Kong is my salvation from 
          trendy San Francisco, a pocket where “it” simply doesn’t matter.  Two 
          humongous fat guys behind me, one white, one black, eating two orders 
          of potstickers.  I’ve had those potstickers, they’re a bit bland but 
          <i>so</i> creamy.  Third time this week I’m sitting at this same table, 
          my palms leaning on the pale veneer, my journal angled on the dark brown 
          trim, restroom door just a few feet behind me.  A middle-aged Chinese 
          guy sets down my white wine, filled to the brim, icy, too sweet too 
          cheap for my friends, I want it more than anything in the world.  All 
          the waiters wear boxy Hawaiian shirts, the same shirts they were wearing 
          in 1977 when I first came here with a bisexual vet (psych discharge) 
          who I would fuck, unsatisfactorily, the following New Years Eve while 
          listening to a Grateful Dead concert on the radio.  A square of sky 
          is pasted on the cover of my small black notebook.  Over the pale lavender 
          and white cloud pattern is printed a lavishly smiling globe, meridian 
          lines along the outer edges, on either side of its mouth-curve half 
          moons suggest jolly corpulent cheeks.  Energy lines emanating from his 
          circle-head arch into space <i>centrifugal swirl of Jesus’ thought waves</i> 
          Ed’s fat face beams cosmic glee <i>no body no Carla.</i>  Walking over 
          here I saw this 300 pound guy, not that tall, waddling towards me with 
          two matching little fluffy dogs on blue leashes—blond and given the 
          dogs and the neighborhood, most likely gay.  I thought of Ed.  He was 
          nothing like Ed.  It’s been two years, but my eyes still suck at fat 
          men, their skin taut and smooth as helium balloons, balloons with cocks 
          bouncing down the street, wrinklefree, so irreducibly Other, I wish 
          for X-ray vision that could bare their souls—with a shimmer the greasy 
          world of grit and concrete dissolves to the Shangri-La that lies within 
          the caverns of every fat man’s belly—waterfalls, monkeys swinging from 
          vines, squawk of bright yellow beaks, the air scented with green herbs 
          and gardenias.  I want assurance that the world is, in fact, a bauble, 
          me lying on my back, kicking and pawing, the world inches from my face 
          dangling at the end of an elastic cord, bobbling.  A couple tables over 
          a guy I almost slept with in the 70s, Spanish, still cute, got to the 
          point of lying on a twin bed with him taking my clothes off.  “I can’t 
          do this.”  And then I left.  I hope he doesn’t remember.  In front of 
          me, dark-haired light-complexioned guy large as Ed is paying his bill, 
          jaw more angular.  He’s with a thin arty blonde, he walks with his hands 
          curled backwards, like Ed did, like I’ve seen so many heavy men doing.  
          He may be a bit larger than Ed.  Loss.  Let’s take a moment here and 
          salute it.  I bet Ed had no trouble replacing me.  I feel like an invalid 
          with my nose pressed up against the window, my eyes enormous as the 
          rest of the world connects and copulates.  A most successful vomit just 
          now.  Though I’d love to have another glass of white wine.  <i>Your

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Everything is seen through the lens of Over.  Ed 
        lying on his back, his hinged arms and legs slow and graceful as a spider’s.<b>  
        </b>Skin pink as kleenexes, and up close just that frail.  I touched him 
        gently.  Ed in the Fairmont’s guest robe, hunched over as he clutches 
        the front—he looked like a giant white single quotation mark.  An opening 
        quote.  Six months later, when he curled down to kiss me at O’Hare, that 
        was the closing quote.<b>  </b>Color and texture took precedence over 
        narrative progression, our moments were bathed in blue and pink and neon, 
        a sultry ambience heightened by a bluesy sax <i>my paunchy Venus, my bucket 
        of playdough, my fucking zeppelin</i> during sex my body felt too small, 
        like a doll’s, like I would be crushed beneath his enormous weight, my 
        little bent-back thighs snapped off.  He was disappointed I was too tall 
        to comfortably fuck from behind like he did his last girlfriend.  Sometimes 
        he couldn’t come but stayed hard, sometimes he went soft while fucking 
        me, sometimes he couldn’t get hard at all—except when we were getting 
        ready to go someplace.  Small beams of light focus on him:  pale hazel 
        eyes, the pinkness of his lips, palms and fingers gnawed bloody.  I’d 
        catch a glimpse of him sometimes, a little animal racing through this 
        white mass of flesh, peeking out through the holes.  His eyes reminded 
        me of John Cassavetes’, so much brain activity going on behind them, eyes 
        registering with superhuman precision—like those security cameras in supermarkets 
        and buses, stereoscopic cameras sweeping and weeping.  Ed’s panoramic 
        emotions scared most people, but bottomless need has always felt natural 
        to me.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I pull out a snapshot of Ed from his college days.  
        Lounging in the passenger seat of a car, he exudes an air of confidence 
        that’s alien to the Ed I know.  He’s checking himself out in the rearview 
        mirror, smiling in sunglasses and red bandanna, like Johnny Depp playing 
        a gypsy.  He’s very thin, very handsome.  Is his past an improvement?  
        Fat chance.  The oneness, the delicious harmony of a stretched round face, 
        huge Buddha-men ambling past me on the street, my head turns towards them 
        all, Hispanic, black, Asian, white, my eyes wet with longing.  My breasts 
        leap forward, plump nipples stiffen to rosy Buddha-heads. <b> </b>In front 
        of me on the Mission bus sits a blond guy with a shaved head, fuzzy ripple 
        of fat at the base of his neck, I imagine the tips of my fingers gently 
        brushing across it, peach down <i>everything comes and goes, no continuity 
        except these fat men who wash over me, wave after wave of being—no longer 
        am I a solid woman, whirling bits give the impression of the form of Carla, 
        like a surrealist painting of a female tornado</i> super vegetarian taco, 
        decadently gunky—cheese, guacamole—and a Dos Equis, a fat black guy, kind 
        of swan backed, just walked by, I look at his belly and wonder—is that 
        how fat Ed was?  Another fat guy cruises by, a white one, his flesh is 
        jiggly, so he doesn’t count.  Both of them in T-shirts.<b>  </b>The city 
        is so gorgeous I can barely stand it—hazy overcast sky, gust of wind, 
        the streets are lined with Sumo wrestler silhouettes, so curvy, generous 
        <i>I gawk and BANG I’m creaming</i> Mission Grounds, all the old timers 
        sitting on Valencia Street in the cold chainsmoking, adapting to the 90s, 
        some fat guy in a blue down jacket comes in, sits down two tables away 
        from me and polishes off the potatoes left on a plate <i>beneath every 
        puffy surface elation flows</i> on Lafayette two fat Filipino boys, 11-ish, 
        short-cropped dark hair, peachy faces, matching baggy jeans, oversized 
        black T-shirts, techno-tennies, gray with black racing stripes, apparently 
        with little wheels on the soles, the boys begin gliding across the sidewalk, 
        like telekinetic salt and pepper shakers, like Coppola’s Dracula, only 
        cute.  Walking down Van Ness from Geary to Market as the sun sets, I remember 
        walking this same half mile when I first moved here, I must have done 
        it a hundred times these past fifteen years <i>snapshots of weather and 
        concrete</i> I see myself, Carla, as a line of selves in multiple exposures, 
        one self stepping into another <i>Nude Descending Van Ness</i> at Market 
        I get on MUNI, a heavy-set guy is sitting sideways at the front of the 
        bus, the position Ed preferred, thighs spread, hand gripping the chrome 
        railing, he’d talk to the driver <i>pang of nostalgia and loss</i> the 
        guy doesn’t really look like Ed.  Dark-haired, fat, sideways—that’s enough 
        for me.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This sack/ is ripe like fallen fruit, like the earth/ 
        used to be.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We fucked during one lunch and Ed skipped the afternoon 
        session on object-oriented programming.  He fretted that “that prick Donald” 
        would notice his absence, but he was glued to my cunt.  After a couple 
        of hours we unstuck ourselves and drove North on 101.  It’s drizzling 
        as we walk through a park near Fort Mason.  We’re on a pilgrimage to revisit 
        places Ed knew in San Francisco, for he lived here, briefly, in his early 
        20s.  Against the overcast, shadowless afternoon the grass glows, an unearthly 
        chartreuse, the winding path is painted a Technicolor red.  Ed wraps his 
        arm around my shoulders and I hook a finger in a belt loop on the back 
        of his pants, melt into his fondue-hot body.  Entwined, we lurch from 
        side to side towards the Marina.  We’re so bubbled up into one another’s 
        heads and bodies I hardly give a fuck who’s looking at us.  It’s like 
        we’re encased in this erotic space suit, gliding together through San 
        Francisco’s alien atmosphere.  Ed points to a tree, “I ate leaves from 
        that tree.”  “Ate leaves?”  “Yeah, I thought I was a dinosaur.  This asshole 
        doctor refused to give me my medication because I asked his receptionist 
        where to buy some grass.  The receptionist was black, so I thought he’d 
        understand, but then he told the doctor and the doctor said I had to go 
        into rehab before I could have any more drugs and I said I’d go crazy 
        without them, and sure enough, within a month, here I was in the Marina, 
        eating leaves.”  I look at the emerald grass, the ruby red curving walkway 
        and think of Oz, the black and white of email bursting forth to glorious 
        color.  “What kind of dinosaur?”  “A T-Rex.”  “But weren’t T-Rexes carnivorous?”  
        “When I was a T-Rex I ate leaves.  What are you, some kind of lizard expert 
        or something.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We cross the street and head for the dock, fishy 
        smell, dozens of boats lined up, covered with royal blue tarps.  We read 
        their names out loud <i>Passing Wind, Indulgence, Caliban, Exhilaration, 
        Elan.</i>  Martian-looking succulents line the sidewalk, large angled 
        stones lead down to water, they look unreal like papier-mâché rocks in 
        a movie set.  Three Japanese tourists <i>mom dad daughter </i>ask Ed to 
        photograph them with Alcatraz above their heads <i>sure what button do 
        you push click want me to do another click you’re welcome.</i>  “Then 
        I walked around down here in circles busy psychically diverting missiles 
        from the people I cared about.  Hear the sound the boats make?”  An arrhythmic, 
        incessant clanking, morose, like a minuet of the dead.  “Yeah, sort of 
        sounds like a wind chime.”  “The tinkles started speaking to me and they 
        said that I had to go to the place of my first death, when I was a T-Rex, 
        which happened to be in the middle of Lombard Street.”  Wind chills our 
        charged salty bodies, libido flowing along our skin, a kiwi-colored mist 
        <i>Lil Angel, Mistress Quickly, Prosper</i> we stop in front of a kelly 
        green dock that leads to the boats.  At the foot of it a metal gate warns 
        unauthorized people like us to keep out.  “They also told me that Reagan 
        was in a submarine on the Bay and I was supposed to go meet him, but I 
        never got that far.  I walked over to Lombard and stood between the lanes 
        like a traffic cop, directing others back to the place of their first 
        death, people were lined up on the sidewalk, cars were screeching and 
        swerving, and I was pointing.”  Ed pokes the air with his finger.  “‘There, 
        there, there!’  I was deadly serious.”  We sit on a weather-stripped bench, 
        Ed’s arm draped around my shoulders, his legs spread, thigh pressing into 
        mine, wind rustles our hair, stings our ears, he kisses me, “Lala I need 
        you,” and I could fuck him right there on the concrete walkway, on the 
        green dock that creaks like a haunted house <i>Polar Bear, Hunky Dory, 
        Roma, Coral, Merlin</i> Ed says, “Look at that seagull, it’s as big as 
        a turkey.”  Behind us kids fly kites, bright red and yellow diamonds.  
        To our left the Golden Gate Bridge dissolves into fog.  “So what happened?”  
        “When?”  “On Lombard Street.”  “Oh, yeah, well eventually the cops showed 
        up with a paddy wagon, put me to the ground and handcuffed me, they were 
        standing over me with fucking billy clubs.  I ended up in the psych ward 
        at SF General, they drugged me so much, Haldol, that I drooled, one side 
        of my face sagging, and the Haldol hurt like hell, cramped my muscles, 
        and I told them, but they wouldn’t listen.  A friend came to visit and 
        when she saw me she started crying.  I’m hungry, how about you?”  “Well, 
        what friend was that—<i>she?”</i></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We drive over to the Lower Haight, to an Indian restaurant 
        Ed’s enthusiastic about.  “The food’s great, you’ll love it!”  We take 
        the only open table, in the corner beside a couple dressed in black leather—jackets, 
        boots, pants for the guy, tight miniskirt for the girl.  Her black eyeliner’s 
        thick as shoestrings.  They look at us like we smell bad.  I dramatically 
        ignore them, opening my menu.  Ed holds my hand across the pink tablecloth, 
        I rub his palm with my thumb.  “Great, they have onion nan.”  When the 
        sari-clad waitress arrives with our food, Ed points to my sag paneer.  
        “Spinach, ugh, reminds me of leaves.”  As we chuckle at his joke, the 
        waitress glances at the leather couple and shares, not quite an eye-rolling, 
        but definitely a <i>look.</i>  “Would you like anything else?”  “No thank 
        you,” I say coldly.  Oblivious, Ed scoops up some lamb.  “It was terrible 
        when I got out of the hospital.  At the halfway house it was my job to 
        set the table and I couldn’t do it, couldn’t remember, no matter how hard 
        I tried, where the forks and spoons and knives went, it was humiliating, 
        Lala, I couldn’t figure out the fucking silverware.”  I awkwardly put 
        down my fork and stroke his hand.  “You poor thing.”  His eyes are wet.  
        He looks so tender, so vulnerable, so unmediated.  I envy his mother, 
        thirty some years before, holding him in his infanthood, his total dependence, 
        their full body contact, she caresses his every limb, every orifice, he 
        sucks her breast like a leech, just rubbing his hand I feel like I’m fucking 
        him.  “Sweetie, you better stop that, you’re making me hard.”  We pull 
        our hands away and eat in silence.  After a few minutes I say, “You seem 
        pretty deft with that fork, you must have eventually figured it out.”  
        “Figured what out?”  “The silverware.”  “Ha ha, Lala—I did, but it seemed 
        to take months, when I could set the table and I was doing well in my 
        art classes—that’s the first time I’d ever painted, and my teacher was 
        very impressed, I still have a couple of the paintings, I was in an art 
        show they had—anyway, once I could set the table, they got me this job 
        in a cookie factory, the owner liked me, he was a nice guy, even gave 
        me a raise, and I enjoyed making cookies, it wasn’t hard to learn how, 
        thank god, and I was comforted by the dough, it was so <i>there,</i> solid.  
        And this restaurant is where the cookie factory used to be.”  Ed looks 
        around the room.  “Wow, it’s so weird to be back here.”  He points to 
        the back wall.  “The oven used to be over there.  I must have made a million 
        cookies, chocolate chip, peanut butter, I got sick of them.  After I moved 
        to Bloomington I couldn’t eat cookies for a year.”  The leather people 
        have grown strangely silent, I know they’re eavesdropping.  “Want some 
        more pilau?” I say as I glare at them.  “So when did you start writing 
        poetry?”  “That was later, when I was in college.  My paintings were always 
        about my madness, but it took me longer to figure out how to honor it 
        in words—it was after I had that episode in Bloomington, you know, with 
        the swans.  When I write poems I can go back to that manic place, where 
        I don’t have to be rational, to clean my act up.  So I go there and I 
        listen and I transcribe what the voices are telling me—it’s like the tinkling 
        of the boats, but inside.”  I can’t remember any of his poems, but I can 
        visualize them—words stacked in narrow spines that hug the left margin—or 
        words flung across the page in the shape of a wing, page after wingy page, 
        the same wing.  “Your poems are very difficult.”  He shakes his head, 
        makes a guilt smirk.  “I know, Lala, they’re practically indecipherable 
        but they have to be because my madness was indecipherable.”  Ed pauses 
        and listens to the leather guy, who’s saying, “I hope you have the courage 
        to let go of the ones that are old and tattered—you don’t want to get 
        in an accident with shabby underwear.”  We share a suppressed giggle.  
        “This lamb was really good, how about yours?”  “Yeah, good, I like the 
        chewy cheese, but you were saying…”  “The poems—sometimes I use the syntax 
        of sign language, it’s totally different than English, more cinematic, 
        like you wouldn’t say, ‘John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln in a theater.’  
        You’d start with the theater, situate it, then move on to the action.  
        So sometimes I write in English but use this sign language syntax, so 
        the English sounds foreign, nobody would see what I’m doing, but I want 
        it there, hovering behind the surface.”  He chews on his index finger 
        as I wave for the check.  “Sweetie,” his tone is urgent, “I miss you, 
        I need to be back in our room, need to hold you.”</p>

        our movie screen <i>flesh dissolves, action dissolves</i> the X-rays from 
        my tremendous ego shrink his cock to the size of a microbe and Ed’s cock 
        goes on a <i>Fantastic Voyage.</i>  As I climax in tidal wave convulsions, 
        sticky fluids suck Ed’s miniature cock through the cervix’s puffy hole 
        and into my bloodstream.  Iridescent blue and red blobs exchange gasses.  
        This is the miracle of life.  Ed’s cock squirms into a capillary, the 
        capillary is warm and tiny, the perfect cunt.  From the walls of my lymph 
        system stringy swamp growth hangs ragged and diaphanous.  Antibodies wrap 
        themselves around Ed’s cock, cellophane noodles thick as snakes, at first 
        Ed’s cock enjoys their snugness, his cock hardens and the noodles tighten, 
        cock flesh bulging between them, tighter, cock flesh pressure building, 
        on the verge of explosion, the antibodies wriggle and suck, Ed’s cock 
        tumbles into my lungs where oxygen crystallizes the antibodies and they 
        break off.  Tender red stripes, rope burns, crisscross Ed’s distressed 
        cock flesh.  My lungs are full of black grit.  Ed’s cock enters the spongy 
        darkness of my tits, nipple holes spiral open like camera shutters, the 
        onrush of light blinds Ed’s cock, all the cock has to do is shoot through 
        the nipple holes, freedom, but what if they snap shut and decapitate the 
        cock head.  Ed’s cock moves on to my heart, marvels at the arches inside, 
        rubbery lace.  The cock has to sneak through between beats or face certain 
        death.  Next stop: ear drum, translucent and delicate as a Japanese paper 
        lampshade.  Ed’s cock whooshes out through a tear duct in my eyeball, 
        my tears wash him down my cheeks.  Relief returns his cock to normal size 
        and the cock races back to Ed’s body, grossed out by my gooey insides.

        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Hong Kong, 6-20-98—</b>In Dolores Park I saw 
          a fat guy lying on his side in the grass, luscious, dark hair pulled 
          back in a ponytail, huge fat chest stuffed into tank top which rode 
          up whenever he lifted his arm over his head, fat armpit, sniff sniff, 
          line of bulbous belly flesh, tanned, fine black hairs.  I felt tenderness 
          for his Ed-ness.  He caught my eye and stared back, surprised yet eager.  
          But now I’m wiped out, discouraged, dizzy.  The schizophrenic who yells 
          about Ronald Reagan at the cable car turn-around is eating in the back.  
          He’s quiet tonight, he’s always quiet in the Hong Kong, and he doesn’t 
          smell, I should have just sat down next to him instead of moving up 
          here.  Directly to my right three tables have been pushed together for 
          some kind of biker celebration.  A biker mom runs up to a guy with long 
          hair and the brightest tattoos, exclaims, “There’s my favorite rocker!”  
          Her skinhead son, leather vest covered with metal spikes and a very 
          large ring though his nose, is talking about how he came <i>this close</i> 
          to having his ass kicked.  Another skinhead across the table says, “You 
          are so rad, dude!”  A white-haired woman lumbers by, hugely fat with 
          a sheer bright blue skirt studded with rhinestones, she says to nobody 
          in particular, “I’d go see just about anything starring Meryl Streep.”  
          A couple more bikers (one fat) and a high school girl have joined the 
          party.  The girl is wearing a Teddy Bear on her back, attached with 
          adjustable nylon straps—I envy her his pulpy belly, his cheeks so tubby 
          and beige, getting to carry him around all the time, right in public.  
          The scrawny biker just removed his jacket, he has so many tattoos on 
          one arm that the bits of flesh peeking through look like an aberration, 
          like he’s some new blue-pigmented creature.  I continue to study the 
          bear, the textured brown straps hanging like growths from its fake fur 
          body, the lazy efficiency of it, freeing her arms of the burden of clutching 
          <i>techno-cuddles</i> look at the way she’s shoveling in that greasy 
          chow mein <i>dark eyes, shoulder-length brown hair with sunstreaks, 
          butterscotch-kissed skin</i> her arm moves from plate to mouth, plate 
          to mouth, and the bear in all its fat fuzziness bumps around on her 
          back in a dumb jig, it’s obscene, I’m getting kind of turned on.  She 
          keeps peeking at me from beneath her bangs, as if she knows I’m up to 
          no good, as if I’m stealing something from her.  She just called the 
          fat biker “Dad.”  He’s one of the hairiest men I’ve ever seen, black 
          hair creeping out from beneath his tank top across arms, chest, shoulders, 
          mass of hair carpeting his beefy red back.  Yuck!  Ed was smooth as 
          a toy, his flesh gleamed.  <i>Sing and rejoice, fortune is smiling.</i>

          trouble shitting and I began pulling whole cabbage leaves out my butt.  
          I showed them to Ed and he said I needed to chew my food better.  In 
          a movie the other night a nurse told a nursing mother to chill a cabbage 
          in the refrigerator and then to peel off some leaves and put them in 
          her bra to cool off her nipples.  I didn’t understand.  Walking over

          For a moment I thought it <i>was</i> him, but then he took a drag off 
          a cigarette and I was saved.  Ed only smokes dope.  The Hong Kong:

        through the cramped brightly-lit aisles.  Outside the pharmacy window 
        frail men sit on a brown naugahyde loveseat waiting for medication, one 
        with a beet-red face carries away a shopping bag full of pills.  I head 
        towards the greeting cards and stumble upon a column of shelves overloaded

        I’ve never heard of Baby Bop before.  The thing is green with a seashell

        big snout—like Abbie Hoffman’s mascot, Pigasaurus, the pig he nominated

        belly.  Lashes surround its round eyes like a domino mask, chubby hands 
        clutch a bright yellow towel.  Its head swivels 360º like Linda Blair’s.  
        Magenta zits sprout across its smooth green shoulders and sides <i>psychic

        knew he’d struck triple cherries, Baby Bop is plastic, and plastic is 
        forever, the sex demon had finally found a home, he loved the toxic scent 
        of his PVC cock.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>A modem doesn’t 
        require any foreplay—just an initialization command.</i></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The earth beneath my computer churns and steams, 
        the Blue Moon triangulates with San Francisco and Egypt, and out of the 
        pyramidal vapors Baby Ka arises, all six feet of him, grave clothes crumbling, 
        magenta torso glowing neon, his third eye, fourth eye, fifth eye, sixth, 
        all his psychic mole eyes spin, piercing through the fog.  He has an enormous 
        19-inch (on the diagonal) cranial capacity.  I’m lying on my back in my 
        white gown, arms thrown back above my head, shoulders drooping off the 
        side of the bed limp as wilted flowers, my eyes bulge like a blind horse’s.  
        The bare bulb in the ceiling casts amber shadows.  Baby Ka crouches on 
        my chest, piggy cheek resting in one hand.  Since he has no genitals, 
        Baby Ka’s trying to figure out what to do with me, he watches as I shift 
        and my white gown tightens around my tits, they look like a pair of snowballs 
        wrapped in tissue paper, Baby Ka’s tail hardens.  It is then that he realizes 
        his tail is really a cock, it pokes up between his pudgy thighs, a thick 
        green arrow <i>airless piggy grunts, seashell headdress above me madly 
        fanning the tender air, green streaks</i> I try to rise but I cannot move, 
        I’m paralyzed on the bed, my cunt open as a 24-hour diner.  When he comes 
        it’s violent, sudden, doors ripping off hinges, my body hurling across 
        the room.  Afterwards I try to turn on the light switch, but it passes 
        right through my hand.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I asked Ed about his father as we lay in the San 
        Jose Fairmont’s king-sized bed, suitcase open on the floor beside us spilling 
        Land’s End pin-striped shirts.  He was a janitor, Ed said, at Wonder Bread, 
        famous for his goofy good cheer.  At the bakery they had these horse pill-sized 
        vitamins they dropped in the dough, niacin, riboflavin, etc.—his father 
        swallowed one once, on a dare.  They said, you’ll be strong as Superman.  
        He got sick as a dog.  Later he swallowed a bottle of aspirin, said it 
        made him feel like he was flying.  And then one summer, behind a giant 
        dough kneader he shot himself in the head.  “That made the TV news,” Ed 
        said.  “Like he was some fucking sniper or something.”  His mother was 
        a basket case, Ed, a junior in high school, had to handle all the arrangements.  
        At the funeral parlor a woman showed up weeping, a stranger, with frizzy 
        red hair and a pink floral dress, huge pink flowers that should have been 
        on a carpet instead of a woman.  Large damp circles under her armpits, 
        everybody had them, fucking Indianapolis July.  She blew her nose into 
        an embroidered hankie and made a beeline to Ed.  “I work at the bakery, 
        too, in packaging.”  She engulfed him in her pasty arms, she smelled like 
        lemons.  “I loved your father!” she wailed.  And then she said it again, 
        in sign language, her gestures stilted and dramatic.  “I LOVE YOU FATHER.”  
        Ed on his back beside me, naked, mimicking her signs.  “She didn’t even 
        know how to do the past tense, and my mother’s right there for Christ 
        sakes, I wanted to slap her.”  The rose-scented air-freshener, a muzak 
        version of “Amazing Grace” wobbling through hidden speakers, useless as 
        road kill his sister and mother slouched in folding chairs, his father’s 
        waxy face poking out of gleaming metal coffin painted to look like wood.  
        “I told the bitch to shut up, and I said to myself <i>fuck this</i> and 
        I walked out, Lala, I walked out on my father’s funeral, and I kept walking, 
        came back two days later, and my mother says to me, ‘You’re trying to 
        kill me too.’”  He clung to me, his arms embracing every cheesy metaphor 
        of need and salvation, his air-conditioned shoulders smooth and cool.  
        When I looked down at him he glowed, his nuzzling face soft focus with 
        a halo around the edges <i>pink Jesus </i>the thought of him left me breathless, 
        the thought of him made me feel unworthy, drove me crazy, the thought 
        of him sneaks into my bed and fucks me until I bruise.  It’s not as bad 
        as it sounds.  PVC softens in sexspace.  Baby Ka’s cock feels more like 
        the new squishy silicone dildoes rather than the rigid pink billy clubs 
        of the 80s.  Sometimes he dry-fucks me, sometimes he spurts a huge amount 
        of sperm.  The sperm is red and moves faster than human sperm.  There’s 
        so much of it that my hemorrhaging uterus won’t wash it away.  I imagine 
        the interior of my womb as black, a huge black galaxy filled with pinpricks, 
        I imagine it shot full of holes, light streaming in <i>Ed plasma streaming 
        like god’s rays into my womb</i> a mass of jello-y crimson substance wavers 
        before me, I open my mouth and gulp, my wild hair streaming about my face.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Baby Ka’s weight and gravity are considerably weaker 
        than Ed’s.  Shorter and flatter, with proximal portions missing, Baby 
        Ka feels light and hollow, husklike.  He’s lost the ability to perform 
        finer, more nuanced acts of dexterity which Ed was able to undertake, 
        and his movements appear as jump-cuts from one cramped position to another.  
        <i>He sees himself speed up the hill in a series of rapid, jerky zigzags, 
        his course sometimes loopy, sometimes a pattern of spirals.  He knows 
        he’s in trouble.  There are red flashes in the air. </i> Baby Ka has changed 
        dramatically over time.  For instance, his hand now comes closer to his 
        elbow and is smaller, like the hand of a child.  His pubic hair’s still 
        blue-black lush, but his cock feels thinglike, passive, inert, a mere 
        object with no animating or receptive interiority <i>if you only have 
        a hammer everything looks like a nail</i> I am colonized, my white gown 
        flays out like feathers, my cunt gashes open like a strawberry, a horse 
        bleeds on the carpet, a black lake sinks into his abdomen, rhythmic slap 
        of jelly belly, his huge red eye above me advancing and retreating, no 
        weeping, just this endless blood-shot staring.  He delivers the asked-for 
        results but the logic is asymmetrical, ornate, doubling back on itself 
        like the web woven by a spider fed LSD <i>admire those who succeed, and 
        learn from their successes 01 21 29 35 36 41</i> sometimes he loses his 
        solidity altogether and passes right through my body <i>the bed looks 
        like a movie screen</i> night after night Baby Ka whines, wails, threatens, 
        complains, and cajoles.  Like a TV, he’s sure everyone’s staring at him.  
        Like a telephone his ears ring and he hears voices.  Like a calculator 
        he thinks he’s just as good as a computer <i>a modem doesn’t ask for a 
        commitment</i> heedlessly he pours forth his litanies of woe into darkened 
        space.  His stickiness directs moisture and immunity to the nucleus of 
        my being, buffers the forces of entropy that accompany my long existence 
        <i>my branch, my golden bough</i> I love him, but I wonder if he’ll hurt 
        me the way Ed did.</p>
