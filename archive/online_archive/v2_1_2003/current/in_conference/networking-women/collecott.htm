        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This essay is part of a project to tease out what 
          Bonnie Kime Scott has called “a tangled mesh of modernists,” and to trace 
          some of the networks of female modernists based in London at the start 
          of the twentieth century, for (as Scott says), “women writers took a great 
          deal of interest in one another.” <A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1">[1]</a> 
          The lines of interest connecting female writers,  editors, thinkers and 
          facilitators, were also lines of energy and creative endeavour; these 
          energies and initiatives formed the grid which supported Anglo-American 
          modernism in Europe in the ’teens and ’twenties of the twentieth century.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The four women with whom I am especially concerned 
          —May Sinclair, Charlotte Mew, Hilda Doolittle Aldington and Alida Klemantaski—were 
          all based in London during the 1914-18 War. </p>
        <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
          <tr> 
            <td><b><img src="../images/collecott1.jpg" width="610" height="438"></b></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> Moreover, they were associated with two significant 
          sites of English modernism, both physically located close to the British 
          Museum: the Poetry Bookshop, established by Harold Monro in 1913, and 
          the <i>Egoist </i>magazine, edited by Harriet Shaw Weaver from 1914 to 
          1919. <A HREF="#_edn2"NAME="_ednref2">[2]</a>They therefore represent 
          what Gillian Hanscombe and Virginia Smyers have called “another Bloomsbury,” 
          paralleling that of the more affluent artists and intellectuals grouped 
          around Vanessa Bell and her sister Virginia Woolf:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>[T]here is another “group” or, more accurately, a loose network, who 
            are less well known but who were women living and writing between the 
            1890s and the Second World War. Unlike Virginia Woolf’s set, these women, 
            who knew each other, or each other’s work, or both, were often expatriate; 
            many were poor; all were more bohemian than bourgeois; and they were 
            more linked by shared choices and interests than by the tighter ties 
            of traditional background and common blood. Nor were all the women poets 
            or novelists; some were editors and publishers, others ran bookshops, 
            yet others provided patronage of both spiritual and material kinds. 
            <A HREF="#_edn3"NAME="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To foreground these women is to turn inside-out the 
          envelope of canonical male modernists, whom W.B. Yeats called the “Men 
          of 1914”: Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, Percy Wyndham Lewis and Richard Aldington. 
        </p>
        <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
          <tr>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> Most of these men had vital and even intimate links 
          with the group I shall call the “Women of 1916,” not to speak of a certain 
          rivalry. When Catherine Dawson Scott, subsequent founder of the International 
          P.E.N. club, <A HREF="#_edn4"NAME="_ednref4">[4]</a> and a friend of May 
          Sinclair, met Pound and Aldington in the spring of 1913, not long before 
          Aldington’s marriage to Hilda Doolittle and the take over of the <i>New 
          Freewoman/Egoist</i> by these self-styled “men of letters,” she put them 
          down as “choosy young gents.” <A HREF="#_edn5"NAME="_ednref5">[5]</a> 
          In 1916, Aldington was younger than both Pound and H.D. and nearly thirty 
          years Sinclair’s junior, yet he patronised the older woman, remarking 
          to a friend in 1916: “Little May is very sweet, and seems to understand 
          in a way.” <A HREF="#_edn6"NAME="_ednref6">[6]</a> Similarly, when the 
          young Eliot became literary editor of the <i>Egoist</i> in 1917, he described 
          the owner and editor Harriet Shaw Weaver, and his predecessor Hilda Doolittle, 
          as “Miss Weaver, a funny little spinster, and Mrs Aldington, better known 
          as ‘H.D.,’ a poetess”: the belittling adjectives and feminine nouns expose 
          the patronising attitude of dominant males. <A HREF="#_edn7"NAME="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Pound, for his part, championed a “virile art,” exemplified 
          by the sculptures of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and asserted in the pages of 
          <i>BLAST</i>. <A HREF="#_edn8"NAME="_ednref8">[8]</a> At the same time, 
          he excoriated as “Amygism” the Imagist movement in whose leadership he 
          had been supplanted by Amy Lowell and whose outstanding practitioner was 
          H.D. Gender was already firmly on the men’s agenda and not introduced 
          into current discourse by the women emerging into public life and agitating 
          for political rights at this time. In the first two decades of the twentieth 
          century, when the struggle for female suffrage and the Great War coincided, 
          the dominant culture in England was authoritarian, pragmatic and militaristic. 
          By contrast, the culture promoted by the Women of 1916 was humanistic, 
          idealist and often pacifist; in a review of Yeats’s <i>Responsibilities 
          and Other Poems</i> (1914), H.D. criticized contemporary geometric art 
          as a betrayal of late Romantic values and blamed the men of her generation 
          for helping to bring about the “world calamity” of modern warfare:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p style="text-align:justify">Our generation did not stand against the 
            enemy—it <i>was</i> the enemy…. For it has merged into this struggle 
            with its own much lauded guns and aeroplanes…. The guns they praised, 
            the beauty of the machines they loved, are no more as a god set apart 
            for worship but a devil over whom neither they nor we have any more 
            control. <A HREF="#_edn9"NAME="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">H.D. was not alone in associating her art with that 
          of the nineteenth-century Aesthetes, rather than the men of her own generation. 
          Both May Sinclair and Charlotte Mew came to womanhood in the 1890s, when 
          Mew’s first published story appeared in the <i>Yellow Book</i>. <A HREF="#_edn10"NAME="_ednref10">[10]</a> 
          Elaine Showalter includes Mew, at least, among her “Daughters of Decadence,” 
          while she associates Sinclair with “Psychiatric Modernism” because of 
          her pioneering work with the Medico-Psychological Clinic in Bloomsbury’s 
          Brunswick Square. <A HREF="#_edn11"NAME="_ednref11">[11]</a>] Sinclair’s 
          latest biographer Suzanne Raitt, documenting her work as an idealist philosopher 
          and as an active feminist, identifies her as a “Modern Victorian.” <A HREF="#_edn12"NAME="_ednref12">[12]</a> 
          Her modernity is evident in her ability to see across national boundaries. 
          Well-known as a novelist on both sides of the Atlantic before the Great 
          War, Sinclair was a key contact for Americans new to London. These included 
          Ezra Pound, who arrived via Venice in 1909; Harriet Monroe, editor of 
          <i>Poetry</i>, who visited from Chicago in 1910; and Hilda Doolittle who 
          came from Philadelphia in 1911 and remained in Europe until her death, 
          fifty years later. </p>
        <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
          <tr> 
            <td><b><img src="../images/collecott3.jpg" width="610" height="443"></b></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> In 1913, Harriet Monroe would publish in the first 
          volume of <i>Poetry</i> the first poems of “H.D. Imagiste” to appear in 
          print, sent from London to Chicago by her foreign editor, Ezra Pound. 
          Not long after, Sinclair championed H.D.’s poetry in pages of the <i>Egoist</i>, 
          explaining to Mew that she was defending the younger writer from a “rather 
          spiteful” attack by the conservative Harold Monro. <A HREF="#_edn13"NAME="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">H.D.’s own connections confirm the impression that 
          women’s interest in, and support of, each other was international—or, 
          at least, transatlantic. Revisiting America after the War with the British 
          poet Bryher, she would see two “singing sisters”: Amy Lowell in Boston 
          and Marianne Moore in New York City. <A HREF="#_edn14"NAME="_ednref14">[14]</a> 
          Between 1914 and 1917, H.D. had worked closely with Lowell on the Imagist 
          anthologies, networking with other contributors in Britain in a deliberately 
          democratic way. <A HREF="#_edn15"NAME="_ednref15">[15]</a> This collaboration 
          challenged Pound’s editorial practice and set an example for transatlantic 
          little magazines such as the <i>Little Review</i> (started in Chicago 
          in 1914, but published in Paris throughout the 1920s). It was through 
          Lowell that H.D.’s telling first volume of poems, <i>Sea Garden</i>, came 
          out from her own London publisher Constable in 1916. <A HREF="#_edn16"NAME="_ednref16">[16]</a> 
          Moore, like Doolittle, was an alumna of Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania; 
          her poems were first published in the <i>Egoist</i> under Richard Aldington’s 
          editorship in 1915. Six years later, in 1921, Moore’s first volume Poems 
          appeared in London from Harriet Weaver’s Egoist Press, at the instigation 
          of Bryher and H.D. By then, Moore was editor of the New York <i>Dial</i>, 
          publishing not only Eliot and Pound, D.H. Lawrence and May Sinclair, but 
          also Djuna Barnes, H.D., and Mina Loy, most of whom would be expatriates 
          in Europe during the nineteen-twenties.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1916, when Aldington joined the army, H.D. took 
          over his editorship of the literary pages of the <i>Egoist</i>, handing 
          them over to Eliot the following year, as we have seen. At that time, 
          her home was a room on the edge of Bloomsbury at 44 Mecklenburgh Square, 
          within walking distance of the <i>Egoist </i>offices and the British Museum 
          Reading Room, where both Marxism and Imagism were brought to birth. </p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Charlotte Mew had been born on Mecklenburgh Square 
          nearly fifty years before and the Woolfs would later run the Hogarth Press 
          from number 37, on the same terrace as number 44, until it was bombed 
          during the Second World War. <A HREF="#_edn17"NAME="_ednref17">[17]</a> 
          Late in 1917, H.D. lent her room there to the Lawrences, who had been 
          expelled from Cornwall on suspicion of spying for the Germans: it was 
          here that D.H. Lawrence corrected the proofs of <i>Women in Love</i> and 
          began to write <i>Aaron’s Rod</i>. Chapter Seven of that novel takes place 
          in “The Dark Square Garden”: “it all seemed so sinister,” Lawrence wrote, 
          “this dark, bristling heart of London”—and, perhaps recalling the coast 
          of Cornwall, he describes the way “[the] houses of the Square rose like 
          a cliff on an inner dark, sea,” while the wind “boomed and tore like waves 
          ripping a shingle beach.” <A HREF="#_edn18"NAME="_ednref18">[18]</a> In 
          <i>Aaron’s Rod</i>, the Aldingtons feature as Julia and Robert Cunningham: 
          a “half-bohemian” American writer married to “a stoutish young Englishman 
          in khaki.” <A HREF="#_edn19"NAME="_ednref19">[19]</a> In <i>Bid Me to 
          Live</i>, H.D.’s later fictionalisation of the same period, <A HREF="#_edn20"NAME="_ednref20">[20]</a> 
          she and her husband feature as Julia and Rafe Ashton—poets whose marriage 
          is, in the words of one critic, a “private war between the sexes,” <A HREF="#_edn21"NAME="_ednref21">[21]</a> 
          while Lawrence appears as the charismatic Federico. Like Ashton/Aldington, 
          Federico/Lorenzo cannot resist attempting to control the writing of Julia/Hilda. 
          <A HREF="#_edn22"NAME="_ednref22">[22]</a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In fact, 1916-1917 was H.D.’s <i>annus mirabilis</i>, 
          when she was free from male control and could publish what she pleased. 
          That year saw her emergence from Imagism and the appearance in the <i>Egoist</i> 
          of ground-breaking longer poems like “Eurydice,” of which Pound disapproved. 
          <A HREF="#_edn23"NAME="_ednref23">[23]</a> So did Aldington and Lawrence, 
          on the suggestive evidence of <i>Bid Me to Live</i>, where Rafe tells 
          his wife to “boil” a poem down to “about a quarter of the length,” and 
          Rico reproaches Julia for attempting to impersonate both Orpheus and Eurydice 
          in a new poetic sequence, and advises her to “[s]tick to the woman speaking.” 
          <A HREF="#_edn24"NAME="_ednref24">[24]</a> As a vivid dramatisation of 
          Eurydice’s last speech to Orpheus, this poetic monologue thrilled May 
          Sinclair, who described it as “the challenge of the self-delivered, defiant 
          soul sent up out of hell.” <A HREF="#_edn25"NAME="_ednref25">[25]</a> 
          “Eurydice” not only challenges the minimalist aesthetic of Imagism, but 
          represents what Rachel DuPlessis has identified as a “struggle for cultural 
          authority” analogous to feminists’ contemporary struggle for a political 
          voice, which was being acted out on a personal level between this woman 
          writer and the men around her. <A HREF="#_edn26"NAME="_ednref26">[26]</a> 
          Like the heroic voice that H.D. would invent for Helen of Troy in her 
          late epic poem “Helen in Egypt,” Eurydice’s defiant speech to Orpheus 
          ruptures centuries of male myth-making, feminine muteness and literary 
          decorum:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>my hell is no worse than yours<br>
            though you pass among the flowers and speak<br>
            with the spirits above earth.<br>
            … my spirit with its loss</p>
          <p>knows this;<br>
            though small against the black,<br>
            small against the formless rocks;<br>
            hell must break before I am lost;<br>
            before I am lost,</p>
          <p>hell must open like a red rose<br>
            for the dead to pass. <A HREF="#_edn27"NAME="_ednref27">[27]</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A cursory comparison between Eurydice’s role as the speaking subject in 
          this poem and Yeats’s representation of Maud Gonne as a second Helen of 
          Troy (“A girl arose that had red mournful lips…”) suggests that, as early 
          as 1917, Hilda Doolittle was preparing the ground for what Adrienne Rich 
          in 1971 called, “the courage… to use the pronoun ‘I’.” <A HREF="#_edn28"NAME="_ednref28">[28]</a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">During her year at the <i>Egoist</i>, H.D. published 
          only three reviews: of Marianne Moore, Amy Lowell and Charlotte Mew. This 
          foregrounding of women poets was more than a generous gesture or payback 
          for support received: it seems to have been a conscious attempt to present 
          the magazine’s readers with a body of writing by modernist women to compare 
          with that of modernist men. In her review of Mew, in particular, H.D. 
          issued a challenge to her male colleagues; pointedly celebrating Mew’s 
          achievement in the “dramatic lyric,” a genre she inherited from Browning. 
          H.D. wrote: “she alone of our generation… has succeeded in this form.” 
          <A HREF="#_edn29"NAME="_ednref29">[29]</a> As soon as Eliot had taken 
          over the editorship, he published a riposte from Pound in the form of 
          a review of his own first volume, <i>Prufrock and Other Observations</i> 
          (1917). Sidelining H.D.’s remarks on Mew, Pound reasserted the male line 
          with the words: “Mr. Eliot has made an advance on Mr Browning. He has 
          also made his dramatis personae contemporary and convincing.” <A HREF="#_edn30"NAME="_ednref30">[30]</a> 
          That put the “poetesses” in their place for half a century or so until, 
          assisted by feminist scholarship, “Shakespeare’s sister” dared to be born.

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Alida Klemantaski was born and bred a Londoner, like 
          the much older Mew. Having grown up in Hampstead with her Polish family, 
          she took lodgings in Bloomsbury, living for a time in Red Lion Square, 
          where William Morris had had his workshops and which was still associated  
          with intellectual socialism. While Sinclair was campaigning for the Vote 
          on the street in the West End, Klemantaski (scarcely out of school) was 
          campaigning in the East End. </p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These women’s experience of political activism in 
          the Suffrage struggle must have shaped their practice in the literary 
          arena; they learned how to network at ground level, to subvert existing 
          structures and convert their disempowerment as individuals into a collective 
          power base. We see a similar reconstruction of social relationships in 
          Sinclair’s work with Jessie Murray at the Medico-Psychological clinic, 
          and in Amy Lowell’s collaboration with H.D. on <i>Some Imagist Poets</i>. 
          The analogues with their writing practices have yet to be studied.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1913, when Klemantaski was twenty, she discovered 
          the newly-opened Poetry Bookshop in a Bloomsbury slum. The Bookshop was 
          created by Harold Monro, publisher of <i>Georgian Poetry</i> and editor 
          of two little reviews, <A HREF="#_edn32"NAME="_ednref32">[32]</a> as a 
          meeting-place for readers and writers of poetry and a lodging-house for 
          American artists like Joseph Epstein and Robert Frost. Despite its resemblance 
          to a down-market gentlemen’s club, the Poetry Bookshop was partly inspired 
          by the shops recently opened by the Women’s Social and Political Union 
          in their campaign for the Vote. These in their turn were modelled on the 
          new-style tea-shops run by J. S. Lyons and the Aerated Bread Company. 
          In the first decade of the twentieth-century, such shops were places that 
          mediated between the public sphere of the workplace and private, domestic 
          space; unlike male-dominated “public houses” or pubs, they were contact 
          zones which could be freely entered by women as well as men, without loss 
          of respect. <A HREF="#_edn33"NAME="_ednref33">[33]</a> Monro’s ambition 
          was to imitate the new entrepreneurs of the market-place and take poetry 
          onto the streets for people’s enjoyment.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While no chain of Poetry Bookshops was created throughout 
          the country, two women following Monro’s example converted a cobblers’ 
          shop in Hull into The Poetry Shop, which flourished from 1919 to 1937. 
          <A HREF="#_edn34"NAME="_ednref34">[34]</a> Also in 1919, Sylvia Beach, 
          returning to Europe from America after the War, visited London en route 
          to Paris to set up shop near the Sorbonne under the sign of Shakespeare 
          &amp; Company. </p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> Modelled on the Poetry Bookshop, this is best known 
          as a poste restante and even rooming-house for expatriates like Georges 
          Antheuil, Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald. As well as selling books 
          and little magazines, it was also a lending library for readers of English, 
          a place for editorial meetings and book launches. Across the street was 
          its French counterpart Les Amies du Livre, opened in 1915 by Adrienne 
          Monnier, Beach’s life-partner, and signalling women’s love of reading 
          in its very name. This did not prevent Beach and Monnier worshipping at 
          the shrine of James Joyce, whose masterpiece <i>Ulysses</i> was published 
          by Shakespeare and Company in 1922. A cartoon by Fitzgerald shows them 
          as a pair of sirens, entertaining their Transatlantic friends and praying 
          to “St. James.” Their bookshops were of course frequented by Gertrude 
          Stein and Alice Toklas; both couples were in long-term contact with H.D. 
          and Bryher, and well-known to Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap, expatriate 
          editors of the <i>Little Review</i>, besides other female modernists on 
          the US/UK/Paris axis such as Djuna Barnes, Nancy Cunard, Janet Flanner 
          and Mina Loy.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Starting in March 1913, and for twenty-three years 
          thereafter, people paid a modest sum to come into the former metalworking 
          workshop behind London’s Poetry Bookshop and listen to verse being read 
          aloud. <A HREF="#_edn35"NAME="_ednref35">[35]</a> Few of these women and 
          men would have had access to the privileged pre-war Bloomsbury salons 
          of Yeats, say, or the Stephen sisters. The readings, on two nights a week 
          (Tuesdays and Thursdays), were held at 5.30 or 6 p.m. so that people could 
          drop in after work, and lasted between thirty and forty minutes. Alida, 
          now Monro’s assistant in the shop and the editorial offices above (and 
          eventually to be his “boy” wife), ran the programme and participated in 
          the live performances. So she was vital to a cultural development which 
          coincided with a dynamic shift from Victorian rules of elocution to the 
          modern art of verse speaking, then being encouraged by the newly-founded 
          Poetry Society and brought into the curriculum by London University and 
          the Royal Schools of Speech and Drama. Moreover, as a public, democratic 
          and relatively non-gender-specific space for cultural events, the Poetry 
          Bookshop anticipated the later twentieth-century concept of the communal 
          Arts Centre, hosting lectures and presentations by the philosopher T.E. 
          Hulme and the Futurist Tomaso Marinetti as well as poetry readings. <A HREF="#_edn36"NAME="_ednref36">[36]</a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A talented actress, like her contemporary “Rebecca 
          West” (who took her pseudonym from the Ibsen heroine she had played before 
          becoming the literary editor of the <i>New Freewoman </i>in 1913), Klemantaski 
          had a “rich, young, contralto voice.” <A HREF="#_edn37"NAME="_ednref37">[37]</a> 
          She soon gained a reputation as a performer as well as a promoter of new 
          poetry. While male poets like Pound and Monro normally read their own 
          work, only a few female poets were willing to perform in public. They 
          included Amy Lowell, Anna Wickham and Edith Sitwell. But among those who 
          preferred Alida to read their poems were H.D. and Charlotte Mew, both 
          of whom were first presented by the Poetry Bookshop in 1915. By 1916, 
          when conscription came in, Bloomsbury felt its proximity to the battlefront 
          (less than a day’s travel away for officers like Wilfred Owen and Osbert 
          Sitwell, who visited  the Bookshop when on leave from the trenches). By 
          now, Monro like Aldington was in uniform and Alida formed a firm friendship 
          with Hilda—another war-bride doing “men’s work” in wartime. Their letters 
          bear witness to this, as does their collaboration over Charlotte Mew’s 
          first volume of poetry, published like H.D.’s in 1916.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Mew, the last of our “Women of 1916,” met May Sinclair 
          at the home of a mutual friend, the brilliant theologian and yachtswoman 
          Evelyn Underhill, in the spring of 1913. Best known for her 1911 study 
          <i>Mysticism</i>, Underhill had published a volume of poems, <i>Immanence</i>, 
          in 1912. The two women were brought together by Catherine Dawson Scott, 
          a prolific writer, literary hostess and political activist for working 
          people and the women’s movement. Scott recorded in her diary: “when Charlotte 
          Mew came I persuaded her to read to us [her poem] ‘The Farmer’s Bride,’ 
          and May was so won over that she deserted me and they went away together.” 
          <A HREF="#_edn38"NAME="_ednref38">[38]</a> Though known to her friends 
          as “Sappho” because of her long poem of that name, Scott was shocked to 
          discover that Charlotte was not only a genius but a pervert: “are all 
          geniuses perverts?” she asked herself, and Mew responded by referring 
          to Scott (who was married to a doctor) as “Mrs Sappho”—which chimes with 
          Amy Lowell’s insistence that Sappho was “Sapho [sic]—not Miss or Mrs.” 
          <A HREF="#_edn39"NAME="_ednref39">[39]</a> In her richly documented biography 
          of Sinclair, Suzanne Raitt sums up the evidence for and against Sinclair 
          having been “bothered” by Mew (as Scott so nicely put it), and notes that 
          “[i]ronically it was this ‘late Victorian’ who confronted Sinclair with 
          the limits of her own modernity by revealing her love to her.” <A HREF="#_edn40"NAME="_ednref40">[40]</a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Mew was in her late forties, with a career in short 
          fiction behind her, when she began to be recognised as a poet. She lived 
          with her mother and sister at 9 Gordon Street, close to 46 Gordon Square, 
          the first Bloomsbury home of Vanessa, Virginia and Thoby Stephen. In May 
          1915 Sinclair invited Mew, Underhill and the Aldingtons to dinner with 
          the no doubt intended result of Mew’s publication in the poetry pages 
          of the <i>Egoist</i>. <A HREF="#_edn41"NAME="_ednref41">[41]</a> Almost 
          simultaneously, Alida Klemantaski came across another poem in the <i>Nation</i>, 
          sought Mew out, featured her work at a Poetry Bookshop reading that Mew 
          attended and, with the support of Sinclair and H.D., persuaded Harold 
          Monro to publish the volume that appeared in 1916 as <i>The Farmer’s Bride</i>.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In her memoir of Mew, Alida Monro (as she then called 
          herself) recalled two problems with the production of this book. The first 
          was that the only compositor employed by the firm of printers used by 
          the Poetry Bookshop was a Methodist who found blasphemy in it and refused 
          to type-set it: “We were forced,” says Alida, “to employ a larger printer 
          the other side of the river, whose compositors were not assailed by religious 
          scruples.” <A HREF="#_edn42"NAME="_ednref42">[42]</a> (She seems to imply 
          that morals were looser on the South bank of the Thames, as in Shakespeare’s 
          day.) This episode anticipates in little the scandal of Joyce’s <i>Ulysses</i>, 
          which met objections from printers in London and New York and was eventually 
          published by Sylvia Beach on the Left Bank of the Seine. <A HREF="#_edn43"NAME="_ednref43">[43]</a> 
          The second problem with <i>The Farmer’s Bride</i> was that Mew’s poetic 
          lines were often (as she admitted) “abnormal in length.” <A HREF="#_edn44"NAME="_ednref44">[44]</a> 
          Since “she did not wish to be run over,” as Alida puts it, “a rather ugly 
          quarto page had to be used.” <A HREF="#_edn45"NAME="_ednref45">[45]</a> 
          The Monros’ support for Mew’s determination to retain the spacing of her 
          handwritten original anticipates Susan Howe’s efforts on behalf of Emily 
          Dickinson. <A HREF="#_edn46"NAME="_ednref46">[46]</a> These issues about 
          the look of the poem on the page are perhaps symptomatic of female writers’ 
          need for intellectual and economic control over the production of their 
          work, as exemplified by Woolf’s experimentation with prose genres for 
          her own Hogarth Press and H.D.’s freedom to publish poems of greater length 
          as literary editor of the <i>Egoist</i> during Aldington’s absence at 
          war. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Sinclair’s comments on both poets show that she was 
          well aware of the significance of such freedoms. She praised in H.D.’s 
          poetry “the power of the clean, naked, sensuous image to carry the emotion 
          without rhyme” and admired in “Eurydice” the writer’s ability to move 
          beyond “a narrow plot, tied by her Imagism.” <A HREF="#_edn47"NAME="_ednref47">[47]</a> 
          She also celebrated, in Mew’s poetry, “depths &amp; depths of passion 
          &amp; sheer beauty” beyond the scope of most Imagists. <A HREF="#_edn48"NAME="_ednref48">[48]</a> 
          These remarks chime with Dora Marsden’s programme for “The Art of the 
          Future,” which stated that “the soul breaks into evidence as readily as 
          pain breaks into a cry,” and called on artists to represent these “movements 
          of the soul” in their work. <A HREF="#_edn49"NAME="_ednref49">[49]</a> 
          In the same spirit, Mew made the cri de coeur or “cry from the heart” 
          central to her poetic, and to her dramatisation of imagined states of 
          mind. “One has not only the cry but the gesture and the accent,” she wrote, 
          in her breathless, unpunctuated style. <A HREF="#_edn50"NAME="_ednref50">[50]</a> 
          Hence Mew’s aesthetic, like Marsden’s, was diametrically opposed to Eliot’s 
          rash definition of poetry as “an escape from emotion”; <A HREF="#_edn51"NAME="_ednref51">[51]</a> 
          rather, she insisted that “the quality of emotion is the first requirement 
          of poetry.” <A HREF="#_edn52"NAME="_ednref52">[52]</a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Suzanne Raitt has suggested that Mew’s “emotional 
          theatre” represented for Sinclair a kind of swan-song for the decadent 
          art they had both enjoyed at the <i>fin-de-siècle</i>. <A HREF="#_edn53"NAME="_ednref53">[53]</a> 
          As we have seen, these “Women of 1916” took their cue not from the “Men 
          of 1914,” but from the late romanticism of Oscar Wilde and W.B. Yeats. 
          H.D.’s idea of her “real artist personality” appears to derive from Wilde’s 
          belief in the stylistic authority of the intense personality of the artist—a 
          belief diametrically opposed to Eliot’s dogma of “impersonality.” Among 
          both novelists and poets, we find an alternative aesthetic which is woman-centred 
          and emotionally engaged, refusing the terms of Eliot’s formulaic distinction 
          between “the man who suffers and the mind which creates.” <A HREF="#_edn54"NAME="_ednref54">[54]</a> 
          They esteem speech and performance as well as writing and print, and—in 
          the spirit of Wilde—cherish the human personality as well as the poet’s 
          art. In his later years, Yeats mastered the art of projecting himself 
          into other selves, dramatic characters as often female as male. Mew called 
          this “impersonation,” and she impersonates men as well as women in the 
          poems of <i>The Farmer’s Bride</i>, presenting a Browning-esque alternative 
          to the “impersonality” sought by the Men of 1914. <A HREF="#_edn55"NAME="_ednref55">[55]</a> 
          Moreover, while Eliot and Pound valued the written rather than the spoken 
          word, the Anglo-Irish tradition of Wilde and Yeats placed a premium on 
          the human voice: for them, in the words of Jacques Derrida, “the voice 
          is consciousness.” <A HREF="#_edn56"NAME="_ednref56">[56]</a> So it was 
          for H.D. and Mew, in their appropriation of the dramatic lyric. Already 
          experienced in minimalizing the verse monologue in poems like “Oread,” 
          H.D. chose for her translation of Euripides’ <i>Ion</i>, begun in 1916, 
          a “broken, exclamatory or evocative vers-libre.” <A HREF="#_edn57"NAME="_ednref57">[57]</a> 
          This resonates with Sinclair’s description of Mew’s “broken, dramatic 
          manner” of voicing her poetry. <A HREF="#_edn58"NAME="_ednref58">[58]</a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Despite her reluctance to perform in public, Mew 
          believed that the best vehicle of felt experience is the human voice: 
          “All verse gains by being spoken, and mine particularly,” she told Dawson 
          Scott. <A HREF="#_edn59"NAME="_ednref59">[59]</a> Sinclair endorsed this, 
          writing to Scott that Mew’s poetry “absolutely needed her voice, her face, 
          her intonation and vehemence, to make it carry.” <A HREF="#_edn60"NAME="_ednref60">[60]</a> 
          Drawing on Scott’s diaries for 1913, Penelope Fitzgerald comments that, 
          when reading:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Charlotte seemed possessed, and seemed not so much to be acting or 
            reciting as a medium’s body taken over by a distinct personality. She 
            made slight gestures and used strange intonations at times, tones that 
            were not in her usual speaking range…. At the end, Charlotte gave a 
            characteristic toss of the head. <A HREF="#_edn61"NAME="_ednref61">[61]</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like Sinclair, Scott and Underhill were intensely 
          moved by Mew’s private readings for her female friends; Scott says she 
          had to pinch herself to keep back the tears, and Underhill felt as though 
          she were “having whisky with my tea.” <A HREF="#_edn62"NAME="_ednref62">[62]</a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Unlike the public events at the Poetry Bookshop, 
          these readings took place in the private space of the Dawson Scotts’ home. 
          Half-an-hour’s train journey from Paddington Station, this suburban salon 
          was accessible from Central London and apparently frequented only by women 
          of Mrs. Scott’s acquaintance, while her doctor husband was at work in 
          his surgery. <A HREF="#_edn63"NAME="_ednref63">[63]</a> In this safe space, 
          these women flouted Edwardian etiquette and broke with the social conventions 
          as they broke into an “Art of the Future.” The venue, on the periphery 
          of literary London and well away from Bloomsbury in both ethos and ethics, 
          correlates with Celeste Schenck’s account of Mew’s “marginal modernism.” 
          <A HREF="#_edn64"NAME="_ednref64">[64]</a> Schenck goes on to ask an important 
          critical question:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>If, as Georg Lukács and feminist critics 
            have noted, the radical poetics of canonized “Modernism” often masks 
            a deeply conservative politics, might it also be true that the seemingly 
            genteel, conservative poetics of women poets such as Mew, whose worth 
            even feminists have overlooked, would pitch a more radical poetics than 
            we considered possible? <A HREF="#_edn65"NAME="_ednref65">[65]</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Reflections such as this suggest to Schenck that, 
          with the examples of Alice Meynell, Charlotte Mew and Anna Wickham before 
          us, as well as those of H.D., Gertrude Stein and Mina Loy, “we must renounce, 
          salutarily, any hope for a unitary, totalizing theory of female poetic 
          modernism.” <A HREF="#_edn66"NAME="_ednref66">[66]</a> By implication, 
          then, literary history must be re-written in a mode that admits difference—of 
          gender, of genre—and of further difference within that difference; but 
          that admission will entail the admissibility of marginal and marginalised 
          modernists such as May Sinclair and Charlotte Mew. Suzanne Raitt notes 
          Mew’s “inability to discount the body” in her reading, as if she were 
          an early twentieth-century exemplar of the French feminist injunction 
          that “Woman must put herself into the text—as into the world and into 
          history—by her own movement.” <A HREF="#_edn67"NAME="_ednref67">[67]</a> 
          That kind of movement can be traced beneath the accepted histories of 
          wartime London and beyond the binary aesthetics of literary modernism: 
          it is still vivid amongst the “Women of 1916.”</p>
