      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this article I will follow a path of links, keywords 
        and visual references to explore <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>’s contribution 
        to the cultures of modernism. This is only <u>one</u> of the several routes 
        offered by the hypertextual database of the <i>Networking Women</i> project. 
        Different types of search are possible: the starting point of the navigation 
        can be a keyword (one’s pseudonym, the title of a journal, the name of 
        a street, a salon, a year, a picture, a theoretical definition, etc.), 
        but also one of the 16 subjects selected to focus on and redefine women’s 
        spaces. The search does not direct one immediately to a document, but 
        rather to a record of the document: what you read in the record is a detailed 
        description and an interpretation of any chosen item (a photograph, a 
        review, a letter, an index, but also a march, a performance, a social 
        gathering, a definition, etc.). When it is possible, and if the copyright 
        holder has given permission, documents are reproduced as attachments to 
        the records. I encourage you to read the technical description of the 
        project, the web site and the search engine that Tatiana Petrovich Njegosh 
        has already provided in detail, in the “postcard” section of HOW2, n. 
        8, dated May 2002 (currently on-line).</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“The underneath of history” is the way Nancy Cunard 
        called what “has been in the records, all along, for all to see” but remained 
        overlooked and unmarked. <A HREF="#_edn2"NAME="_ednref2">[2]</a> I borrow 
        her definition to describe the space in modernist cultural history that 
        the <i>Networking Women</i> project is determined to explore and illustrate. 
        The objective is to draw a map of the geography of networks created by 
        modernist women, a territory in many ways still uncharted. We intend to 
        walk around and bring to the surface what we can: those women, often forgotten, 
        marginalized, ridiculed or erased (symbolically, think of H.D.’s name, 
        but also physically, see Elsa Asenijeff’s confinement in a mental hospital), 
        expand traditional notions of modernism in exciting ways, their work often 
        overflowing the boundaries of genres and disciplines. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bryher’s role as publisher and covert editor of the 
        journal <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i> is an interesting case study. Bryher’s 
        networks were not only webs of people, but moreover systems where ideas 
        of modern culture were organic to the need to rethink and reform (just 
        to name a few of her countless fields of interest) aesthetic theories, 
        assumptions on gender roles, relationships between the sexes or the structure 
        of the educational system. (See, for instance, her “The Best Years of 
        One’s Life”). In <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i> the intention to create 
        an international cultural network connecting writing, arts, science, social 
        critique in a global scope was evident:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The world is narrower while knowledge is wider, and that the former 
          be not destroyed, it is essential all branches of the latter be related. 
          No one group, be it of artist or artisan, socialist or psychologist, 
          painter, photographer or printer, can live in ignorance of implications 
          of the other. <A HREF="#_edn3"NAME="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Internationalism was the distinctive feature of the 
        magazine, that was available all over the globe. (See <u>where L&amp;L 
        was on sale</u>). The scope of authors, travel writing, and reports from 
        all over the world testifies to the attitude of its patroness: “All my 
        life I have suffered from ‘geographical emotions’. Cities are so much 
        easier to understand than people.” <A HREF="#_edn4"NAME="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Life and Letters To-Day</i> aimed at becoming 
        a centre for cultural debate on literature and the arts, promoting young 
        talented writers, and, in general, at being a crucible for the new, which 
        included new sciences such as psychoanalysis and anthropology and new 
        arts such as cinema. </p>
      <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
        <tr>

      </table>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“To-Day” was added to the old title <i>Life and Letters</i> 
        to emphasize the interest in everything contemporary: “We chose that word 
        rather than ‘modern’ so as to be free of a time-label. Modern is often 
        the mode of a yesterday that never had a to-morrow. To-day is continuous. 
        [...] our main interest is with work looking forward”. <A HREF="#_edn5"NAME="_ednref5">[5]</a>  
        “To-Day” was meant to sponsor, together with an aesthetic vision organic 
        to individual experience and socio-political history, the new lesson of 
        the age: how to become modern. In Bryher’s view, attaining this temporal 
        dimension meant blurring the boundaries of entities traditionally constituted 
        as predetermined and impermeable. From the pages of <i>Life and Letters 
        To-Day</i> she suggested the necessity to overcome the notion of gender 
        difference for a more “modern” vision, moving beyond traditional boundaries 
        between male and female. In a <u>review of Richardson’s <i>Clear Horizon</i></u> 
        she wrote:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>It is perhaps a pity that Miriam should insist so often upon the classification 
          of people into male and female, when modern discoveries show that in 
          many respects the division must not be too rigidly made. It is however 
          the logical outcome of Victorian training with its relegation of women 
          apart from the favoured few, to the position of serfs. Yet for Miriam 
          to accept the changed views of a post-war world might be to blunt this 
          portrait of a truly pioneer generation. <A HREF="#_edn6"NAME="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The magazine often dedicated a whole section to foreign 
        literature translated into English (publishing, among the others, Kafka, 
        Jean-Paul Sartre, and Ignazio Silone, or, for instance, dedicating whole 
        issues to Chinese, Indian, Scandinavian literature), and, quite unusually 
        for the time, occasionally presented reviews of translations <i>as </i>translations. 
        (See the <u>review of H.D.’s Ion</u>) “[W]e ourselves, with our translations 
        and articles on other countries, attempt to keep the world open.” <A HREF="#_edn7"NAME="_ednref7">[7]</a> 
        <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i> itself was an expression of Bryher’s intent 
        to advance cultural work that produced fissures in the stable order imposed 
        by traditional patriarchal narratives, allowing the passage of new meanings 
        that could rip culture open, not only to include her and her circle’s 
        priorities but also to redefine its very structure:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Arabic is a language of which we could scarcely understand less. So 
          it was to our surprise that we found ourselves one night in October 
          sitting in the Royal Egyptian Legation, listening to a lecture in Arabic 
          on a poet of a thousand years ago. Our surprise was not lessened by 
          a lady saying, as she took the next chair, “My husband would have been 
          here but he’s in Lapland.” Her words brought yet another world into 
          a room already containing several—robed gentlemen from Iraq walking 
          with covered heads among chrysanthemums and rout chairs, beneath crystal 
          chandeliers and other appurtenances of a West-end mansion with Dorchester 
          House outside confusing us more with its suggestion of New York skyline. 
          But we concentrated, observed the rhythms of Arabic, made mental notes 
          of the apparent double layers of pitch and were rewarded, later, with 
          translations. <A HREF="#_edn8"NAME="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The author of this passage is not fascinated by the 
        instrumental use of language, mere connecting tube between different mother-tongues, 
        but rather by the potential offered by the co-presence of such a variety 
        of cultures converging in one place and conversing with each other. Often 
        represented as an epoch of fragmentation and alienation, certainly exacerbated 
        by conflicts and innervated by imperialist will to power and anxiety over 
        emerging cultural “others,” be it women campaigning for suffrage or colonial 
        subjects demanding independence, modernism between the wars can also be 
        visualised as a period of enthusiasm over technological innovations of 
        means of transport, as instruments and symbols of cultural discovery, 
        and over internationalism as one of the keys to progress. As Tatiana Petrovich 
        aptly underlines, <A HREF="#_edn9"NAME="_ednref9">[9]</a> Woolf in “Mr. 
        Bennett and Mrs. Brown” purposefully gives her discussion over the making 
        of the modern novel a moveable setting: the train, where the characters 
        of the title are travelling from Richmond to Waterloo. Her vision connects 
        the shifting values of modern reality to the possibility of change and 
        to the progressive blending of public and private spaces. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The piece I’ve quoted from in <i>Life and Letters 
        To-Day</i> strikes similar chords: its author highlights movement, relocation 
        and displacement as the privileged lens for reading modernity, just as 
        the intersection of different spaces becomes one of its inextricable qualities. 
        What <i>takes place</i> in the text is both an emphasis on and a redefinition 
        of space(s): a new relation of human beings to global space, a new relation 
        of women to public space (not only can the lady attend the meeting without 
        her husband, but we also find out later in the text that the reader of 
        the poems is a woman herself), a new relation of British intellectuals 
        to foreign ones—although their representation is certainly not free from 
        exoticist attitudes, it seems at least aware of the other’s specific culture—and 
        finally, a new relation to the constructed and derivative nature of any 
        language rather of translation. Moreover, the author of the passage outlines 
        a point that was further stressed by the journal’s editorial policy: the 
        necessity of cultural multiplicity, travel and translation (travel <i>as</i> 
        translation, and vice versa) to grasp modern reality and, if possible, 
        to intervene in it and try to change it. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The journal had been started in quite a different 
        tone. In a letter to Vanessa Bell dated February 1928 Virginia Woolf writes: 
      </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Desmond has been given £ 6.000 by Oliver Brett to start a monthly magazine 
          with. How bored you would be to hear all of us authors chattering about 
          it!—not that it will ever come out, but if it did come out it would 
          be the most brilliant, the most advanced, the best said paper in the 
          world—Also it would make Desmond’s fortune, so he says. <A HREF="#_edn10"NAME="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The magazine indeed came out, it was called <i>Life 
        and Letters</i> but its editor, Desmond MacCarthy, wasn’t greeted with 
        the fortune he had expected. <i>Life and Letters </i>reflected MacCarthy’s 
        interests in established British authors and detective stories and his 
        personal connections with figures of the Bloomsbury set. After a few years 
        the journal went through financial difficulties and MacCarthy had to leave 
        his position; in April 1934 Hamish Smile took over as editor. He edited 
        just one issue and in September 1934, when Constable and Company acquired 
        the magazine, he was replaced by Ellis Roberts. Soon after <i>Life and 
        Letters </i>was for sale again. Acquired by the Brendin Publishing Company, 
        its name was changed into <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>. Its headquarters 
        were in Maiden Lane, central London.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The Brendin Publishing Company belonged to Bryher, 
        but her connection to the magazine often goes unnoticed. Bryher (born 
        Winifred Ellerman) is better known for being H.D.’s lifelong companion. 
        Barbara Guest suggests that the review was bought by Bryher to provide 
        H.D. with a place to publish her poetry and prose. <A HREF="#_edn11"NAME="_ednref11">[11]</a> 
        However, the thirties issues of the magazine presented hardly anything 
        by H.D., aside from a handful of poems, while publishing a bulk of prose 
        and criticism by Bryher herself. Robert Herring and Petrie Townshend were 
        appointed as editors. Herring and Bryher had already worked together for 
        <i>Close-Up</i>. Here is a picture of the two:</p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Petrie Townshend—editor with Herring for two volumes, 
        but unmentioned in Guest’s paragraphs on the <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>’s 
        experience—was a long-time friend and a former school-mate of Bryher’s. 
        In April 1935 she wired Bryher to inform her that <i>Life and Letters 
        </i>was on sale for £1,500. Bryher was positively interested. She was 
        in Kenwin, her Swiss residence, and had just come back from New York where 
        she had collected enough writing to put two volumes together. She was 
        too busy to edit the magazine personally, but she planned to hire somebody 
        to do “the hackwork” while she would be in charge of the actual collection 
        of manuscripts. </p>
      <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">

        </tr>
      </table>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bryher contacted Robert Herring offering him the 
        job of editor and asked Petrie Townshend  to be the paper’s business manager. 
        Townshend refused and asked for an editorial position. (See details on 
        <u>the acquisition of L&amp;L</u>) The first number of <i>Life and Letters 
        To-Day</i> was issued on September 1935. Bryher’s influence on the magazine 
        is evident, not only for the financial support she offered to it, but 
        also because contributions and editorial slant were largely determined 
        by her interests and personal connections. The first two issues of <i>Life 
        and Letters To-Day</i> presented contributions by H.D., Mary Butts, Dorothy 
        Richardson, and Gertrude Stein; all of whom had already been published 
        by Contact Publishing Co., the publishing house directed by Robert McAlmon, 
        Bryher’s first husband—who was to a large extent assisted by Bryher herself, 
        though she preferred to stay out of the limelight. Among the contributors 
        to<i> Life and Letters To-Day</i> we find several figures dating back 
        to the <i><u>Close-Up</u></i> project, such as Oswell Blakeston, Barbara 
        Low, Serghej Ejzentejn, Dorothy Richardson and other more or less intimate 
        friends, like Sylvia Beach, Sylvia Dobson, Melitta Schmideberg, the psychologist, 
        Kenneth Macpherson, Bryher’s second husband, Hanns Sachs, Bryher’s analyst, 
        Havelock Ellis, with whom Bryher had a 20-year correspondence, and even 
        16-year-old Perdita, H.D.’s daughter adopted by Bryher.</p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When, in <i>The Days of Mars</i>, Bryher writes about 
        <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>, she includes herself in the editorship 
        of the paper:  </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p style="text-align:justify">It is difficult to understand the general 
          boycott of <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i> by present literary historians 
          of the period. Besides contributions from the Sitwells, H.D., Elizabeth 
          Bowen, Dylan Thomas, Vernon Watkins, Alex Comfort and many other writers, 
          <i>we </i>printed, I believe, the first story by Sartre to be translated 
          into English and an early tale by Kafka. <A HREF="#_edn12"NAME="_ednref12">[12]</a> 
          (emphasis mine)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bryher’s influence on <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i> 
        was not limited to money and contacts, but she preferred to remain in 
        the wings of the projects whose existence and success depended both on 
        her patronage and on her active work. As a writer she contributed short-stories, 
        criticism, reviews and comments; as editor she directed the magazine to 
        represent her chief interests, such as psychoanalysis, cinema, travel 
        writing, history, education, science and everything “new”: “A new period, 
        in the art and letters with which we are primarily concerned, has long 
        been discernible [...] and we feel ourselves suited to play a part in 
        printing and recording whatever may be the best achievements of the new 
        reign.” <A HREF="#_edn13"NAME="_ednref13">[13]</a> </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">History does not occur—but it is often written—in 
        decades. As Jane Dowson underlines in her book on women’s poetry of the 
        thirties the notion of a decade as a category of literary analysis needs 
        to be redefined since “it is its periodising impulse—in its insistence 
        on ‘groups’ and ‘movements’—which is often responsible for excluding women.” 
        <A HREF="#_edn14"NAME="_ednref14">[14]</a> The British thirties are usually 
        represented by a well defined group of young male poets who first used 
        their craft to promote revolution and later disavowed both poetry and 
        politics practiced in that phase. Usually defined as the age of ideology 
        and realism, hostile to experimental writings or any indulgence in the 
        inner self, and indifferent to race as an issue, the thirties are considered 
        “a sort of unfortunate historical blip or bypass in which writing got 
        snagged and slowed down in the good long march of the twentieth century 
        from modernism at the beginning to postmodernism at the end.”<A HREF="#_edn15"NAME="_ednref15">[15]</a> 
        A monopoly on the decade has long been held by the so-called Auden generation, 
        identified by Samuel Hynes in the homonymous book as a group of left-wing 
        writers born between 1900 and 1914.<A HREF="#_edn16"NAME="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This definition reinforces the image of a homogenous 
        group of men whose work fully exhausts discussions of the age. A multitude 
        of women is disqualified in a single blow, links and relations across 
        countries and generations are erased. In fact, things were quiet different: 
        for instance, women did produce as much political poetry as men and did 
        show the same awareness and commitment that brought Hemingway and Spender 
        to Spain. Nancy Cunard, Sylvia Townsend Warner, Valentine Ackland and 
        Muriel Rukeyser, all of whom were published by <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>, 
        are among them. On the other hand some women writers were deeply involved 
        in very different issues: “pure” aesthetics, experimentalism, introspection, 
        autobiography, history and even sentimental writing. Among them were Bryher, 
        H.D., Edith Sitwell, Elizabeth Bishop, Dorothy Richardson, Janet Adam 
        Smith, Mary Butts, Marianne Moore, Marya Zaturenska, Pearl Buck, Barbara 
        Low, Elizabeth Madox Roberts, Norah Hoult, Margaret Cole, Lotte Reiniger, 
        Gertrude Stein, just to quote those who were (often) published and discussed 
        in the pages of <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Possibly these women would not like to be “segregated” 
        in a separate history, for two reasons at least: firstly, because most 
        of them refused to be identified as “women writers” and rejected the need 
        for such a category; secondly, because women and men were by and large 
        involved in the same projects. As Lisa Rado well puts it: “[r]ather than 
        frustrated prisoners of patriarchal law, these female intellectuals felt 
        themselves to be at the forefront of a new era of possibilities for their 
        sex, and worked tirelessly towards its realisation.” <A HREF="#_edn17"NAME="_ednref17">[17]</a> 
        But, as it is well known, while women’s cultural contributions have often 
        gone unnoticed, their male counterparts have received disproportionate 
        attention. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Though it published and reviewed a remarkable group 
        of women poets and writers,<i> Life and Letters To-Day</i> didn’t profess 
        any interest in women as a group to cherish or promote. The magazine was 
        a site for debate, a public forum on crucial literary and social matters. 
        It was acknowledged to be at the forefront in the promotion of left international 
        anti-fascist culture and was considered “a sort of quarterly <i>Left Review</i>,” 
        defined as such by <i>The Criterion</i>. The editors of<i> Life and Letters 
        To-Day</i> must have agreed with the definition, since they published 
        it as an internal advert. <A HREF="#_edn18"NAME="_ednref18">[18]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Left Review</i>, the British journal closely allied 
        with the Pro-Soviet Writers’ International, promoted revolutionary literature 
        and had as its guidelines, as stated in the first issue in October 1934, 
        anti-fascism, the development of a new socialist society and anti-imperialism. 
        <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i> often published its adverts: </p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Unlike <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>, <i>Left Review</i> 
        published contributions directly dealing with feminism and women’s questions, 
        such as “The Reluctant Feminists” by Naomi Mitchinson (December 1934), 
        “Feminists and the Woman Question” by Philippa Polson (September 1935), 
        and “Women in Scotland” by Willa Muir (November 1936). These debates didn’t 
        arouse <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>’s interest. The magazine didn’t 
        champion an explicit gender or sexual politics, and indeed at first it 
        embraced an idea of culture removed from all kinds of politics. In the 
        first editorial of <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>, in September 1935, 
        we read: “[n]ow is not the time to talk of a brave new world, moreover 
        we have eschewed politics.” A further analysis proves that things were 
        quite different: considering what was published in the following pages 
        the statement proves to be inaccurate. The issue presented an article 
        by Havelock Ellis on Rousseau as forerunner of communism; a speech delivered 
        by André Gide at the International Congress of Writers in Paris, where 
        the French writer advocated communism as the “true defender of culture” 
        and essential for the making of the “new man”; an article on Brecht; and 
        one on war in South America. (See Contents L&amp;L Sept. 1935) <i>Life 
        and Letters To-Day</i> never advocated communist propaganda like <i>Left 
        Review</i>, but it was undoubtedly left-wing. Throwing together Gide, 
        Brecht, an article on war, Gertrude Stein on English and American language, 
        and Horace Gregory on new American poetry, the journal indicated that 
        between aesthetics and social-political realities no single dividing line 
        could be drawn. Indeed the magazine’s name put “life” and “letters” on 
        the same level, implying that each term resounded with the other. As the 
        editors explicitly claimed in the summer 1936 editorial, the magazine 
        addressed readers who “have room in their minds for social problems as 
        for sonnets.” Nancy Cunard, who believed that revolutionary writers and 
        poets had to share “the burdens, the problems, the tragedies of suffering 
        humanity,” <A HREF="#_edn19"NAME="_ednref19">[19]</a> was in tune with 
        the stance adopted by <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>.  “Then, now—<i>à 
        la mode du temps</i>—that the artist become the act”<A HREF="#_edn20"NAME="_ednref20">[20]</a>: 
        indeed during the summer of 1936 times had changed, especially in Spain. 
        In the November issue of <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i> the editorial 
        read like this: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>…we expressed the intention of being non-political […] it would be 
          useless to maintain now that Spain’s civil war is none of our business. 
          It is everyone’s business. <A HREF="#_edn21"NAME="_ednref21">[21]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Cunard shared the position expressed in the editorial: 
        in her first contribution to <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>, a poem, she 
        writes “All of it, all of it’s Spain.” <A HREF="#_edn22"NAME="_ednref22">[22]</a> 
        The rising of fascism in Spain was Cunard’s life-long torment and source 
        of inspiration: she played a leading role in anti-fascist struggles, helping 
        refugees, writing journalism, collecting funds and editing poetry. In 
        1937 she edited <i>Authors Take Sides</i>, whose advert appeared on the 
        winter issue of <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>. <A HREF="#_edn23"NAME="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The pamphlet-survey, edited by <i>Left Review</i>, 
        collected 148 answers to the <u>Question</u>. On the Spanish situation, 
        <i>Life and Letters</i> published several poignant stories and reports; 
        among them <u>“Barcelona, 1936”</u> by Muriel Rukeyser. <A HREF="#_edn24"NAME="_ednref24">[24]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bryher and Rukeyser not only shared a vivid interest 
        in writing, but also, although they belonged to different generations, 
        a passion for flying (see <u>one of Bryher’s letters to Rukeyser</u>). 
        The excitement over adventure and travel was one of Bryher’s peculiar 
        traits. Her “gestures of decentering” <A HREF="#_edn25"NAME="_ednref25">[25]</a> 
        were part of their quest for self-determination: refusal to be rooted 
        in a given gender and sexual identity was also enacted through travel 
        and relocation. The concept of travel as liberation shaped Bryher’s notion 
        of aesthetic experience and surfaced in most of her writing: “[t]hus, 
        to Nancy travel grew wonderful as a book, an inevitable thing, her proper 
        heritage.” <A HREF="#_edn26"NAME="_ednref26">[26]</a> It’s in her homage 
        to Mary Butts however that Bryher finely describes the feeling of entrapment 
        that she must have endured as a woman born in the Victorian age:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="text-align:justify">We were pruned of every form of self-expression, 
          like the single flower on an exhibition stem, until everything in us 
          went into a single desire, freedom, which we saw only in the wind or 
          in the breaking waves and as we could not hold these, into what was 
          nearest to them, poetry. […] It was, however, the sign of our age, the 
          identification students will tag to us, when we are dug out, as the 
          Elizabethans were in the nineteenth century, after the night of forgetting 
          almost sure to come. <A HREF="#_edn27"NAME="_ednref27">[27]</a>]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I suggest that here the limitations imposed on women 
        are expressed not only in terms of a restricted physical and emotional 
        space, but also as a motionless temporal dimension, devoid of the possibilities 
        offered by the future. Possibly the origins of Bryher’s commitment to 
        internationalism and “the new” ar  inscribed in this passage.</p>
