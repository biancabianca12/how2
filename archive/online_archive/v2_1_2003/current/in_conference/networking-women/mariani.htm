      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>1. “The buried, the wasted and the lost”</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When I was asked to take part in this research project—“Networking 
        Wo/men: Subjects, Places, Links: Europe-America, 1890–1939”—and I proposed 
        the name of Muriel Rukeyser as the subject/link of my study, I had already 
        published a few essays on her work. <A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1">[1]</a> 
        I knew that she had given all of her manuscripts, letters and notes to 
        the New York Public Library, but I could not figure out what precious 
        contribution the thorough analysis of those documents would bring to our 
        entire research.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I must admit that when I first touched that material 
        (at the beginning of January 1999), I was astonished or, better, overwhelmed, 
        at the view of piles and piles of papers, that had belonged to Rukeyser, 
        lying on the shelves of the Berg Collection. I immediately recalled a 
        line of hers: “There is also, in any history, the buried, the wasted and 
        the lost”; it is a fragment that does not belong to a poem, but is to 
        be found in The Life of Poetry, <A HREF="#_edn2"NAME="_ednref2">[2]</a> 
        a book of theory and criticism described in 1950 as “ambitious,” “profound” 
        and “demanding.” This meaningful line opens chapter six and, precisely, 
        its first paragraph, which is entitled “Choice and the Past.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Buried,” “wasted,” “lost.” In front of me I could 
        see an unpredictable amount of folders buried under folders, notes buried 
        under notes—wasted, lost history—letters under letters, that had been 
        separated from the envelopes they belonged to—I do not know by whom, I 
        do not understand why. Nobody, as far as I could tell, had ever examined 
        that material before, nobody had quoted it; what I knew for sure was that 
        I did not want to lose that buried treasure Muriel Rukeyser seemed to 
        have left to us, seemed to have saved for us, to be explored, exploited, 
        arranged, selected. Paraphrasing the titles of the book and the paragraph 
        I have just mentioned, I felt that, through those cherished pieces, I 
        could make a “choice of her past,” “give it a new life.” And I immediately 
        realized they would certainly reveal Rukeyser’s connections and relationships—the 
        ones I was looking for, in order to contribute to the construction of 
        networking paths between our wo/men.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>2. “Rare intellectual bird of communication”</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I was amazed at the view of Rukeyser’s papers because 
        of their number; but other complex emotions and expectations were aroused 
        in me, which—I believe—happen to be stirred up when one works on archival 
        material, on documents that have never been published before. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I understood that Rukeyser, who had brought the events 
        of the world into poetry and poetry into the world, and who had written 
        a lot about herself, had intended to save a special chapter of her biography. 
        And much more. As a matter of fact, besides the typescripts of several 
        of her books and the manuscripts of some of her famous pages—which I believe 
        most writers commonly wish to keep for themselves and their posterity—Rukeyser 
        had saved all sorts of apparently meaningless notes. In the Berg Collection 
        I found small torn pieces of paper where, in her elegant handwriting, 
        she had jotted down phrases, ideas, suggestive words (literature, indeed!); 
        I happened to discover an envelope, on the back of which she had written 
        her shopping list—blueberries and cantaloupe among other things—and an 
        incomplete sonnet; a business reply card (that was to be sent to a telephone 
        company of New York), on the back of which she had scribbled a few lines 
        on loneliness; a single sheet of paper where she had typed the carbon 
        copy of a letter to President Roosevelt together with the one sent to 
        Paul Muni, the famous actor. But most of the folders contained her correspondents’ 
        letters, dated 1932–1976.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I was puzzled. I wondered why Rukeyser had saved 
        all those letters, and the envelopes too, for more than forty years. We 
        do not need the help of psychology to understand that saving her correspondence 
        was a way of keeping the memory of herself and of her ideological, political, 
        poetical changes through different periods of life, together with the 
        memory of the people she was connected with; it was a means of keeping 
        “control” of her subjects / places/ links—her wealth of human meanings 
        and resources. I also believe this was a way of communicating that she 
        did not want to reject or dismiss anything of her life. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I also searched for an answer to my puzzlement in 
        what I knew about her. From the earliest moments of her career, she had 
        cried out for total communication, against the indifference of the intellectuals 
        who would retreat to an “ivory tower” <A HREF="#_edn3"NAME="_ednref3">[3]</a>; 
        she had seen the writer as one who would always be in readiness to receive, 
        in readiness to respond; she had sought a poetics of relationship and 
        process; moreover, she used to say that poems were “meeting places” (see 
        below). In that definition I found a partial answer to my perplexity. 
        Her correspondence, the letters she wrote and the ones she received, were 
        probably also meeting places, disclosing undefined possibilities. They 
        were “localities”—using the term we have adopted within our research—where 
        she would encounter “those men and women / Brave, setting up signals across 
        vast distances”; and the meanings of those “signals,” once transferred 
        to the New York Public Library, would be shared with her readers.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>3. “Signals across vast distances”</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The reason why I have chosen the above quoted lines 
        for the title of my paper is twofold. First, they seem to reiterate and 
        mirror (or should I say foreshadow?) the main concepts of the title of 
        our research and our conference. Think of the hyphenated expression “Europe-America,” 
        that has geographical, historical, ideological implications which seem 
        to correspond to Rukeyser’s “vast distances.” Think of those “men and 
        women” that are included within the two titles. Think of those “signals” 
        and compare them to the “sphere of signs” of our research project, which 
        Marina Camboni refers to in her introduction. Secondly, those lines belong 
        to a lyric that covers and frames some of the events that Rukeyser was 
        aware had shaped her life, her vision of the dynamic ebb and flow of reality:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>I lived in the first century of world wars.<br>
          Most mornings I would be more or less insane,<br>
          The newspapers would arrive with their careless stories,<br>
          The news would pour out of various devices<br>
          Interrupted by attempts to sell products to the unseen.<br>
          I would call my friends on other devices;<br>
          They would be more or less mad for similar reasons.<br>
          Slowly I would get to pen and paper,<br>
          Make my poems for others unseen and unborn.<br>
          In the day I would be reminded of those men and women<br>
          Brave, setting up signals across vast distances,<br>
          Considering a nameless way of living, of almost unimagined values.<br>
          As the lights darkened, as the lights of night brightened,<br>
          We would try to imagine them, try to find each other.<br>
          To construct peace, to make love, to reconcile<br>
          Waking with sleeping, ourselves with each other,<br>
          Ourselves with ourselves. We would try by any means<br>
          To reach the limits of ourselves, to reach beyond ourselves,<br>
          To let go the means, to wake.</p>
        <p>I lived in the first century of these wars. <A HREF="#_edn4"NAME="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Poem” (this is the remarkably simple and elegant 
        title of the composition) was published in 1968, in the volume entitled 
        <i>Speed of Darkness</i>, but I do not know when it was written. It doubtless 
        reveals Rukeyser’s understanding of the powerful relationships that exist 
        between history, consciousness and creativity. And now, thanks to the 
        papers I have analyzed, I can assert that she developed that understanding 
        in the course of the years under scrutiny in the present research (1932-1942). 
        Indeed the documents I found in the Berg Collection—some of which are 
        attached to the records in our web site <A HREF="#_edn5"NAME="_ednref5">[5]</a>—besides 
        giving a clear perspective on her participation in the debate on modernist 
        poetics, offer paradigms for tracing her “links” in general and what I 
        would call her “connections” between her Jewish identity and her principles 
        of relationship and witnessing.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>4. “The witness is myself. / And you, / The signs, 
        the journeys of the night survive”</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One way of witnessing for Rukeyser was to write: 
        essays, reviews, biographies, plays, poems. Given her belief that nothing 
        should be excluded from the auspices of the literary imagination, it is 
        not surprising that she wrote on an extraordinary range of topics, many 
        of which are extra-disciplinary to poetry.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Poetry, she maintained, can be a transfer of human 
        energy, make changes in existing conditions, extend the document. <A HREF="#_edn6"NAME="_ednref6">[6]</a> 
        And I believe that the documents I have in my hands, if I join them through 
        interpretive and relational paths, can “extend” her poems, “transfer” 
        her passionate vision, make us understand why she rejected false divisions—between 
        poetry and politics, for instance—and why she refused disciplinary splittings, 
        such as the ones commonly accepted between literature and science. I feel 
        that what I have in my hands are extraordinary “findings,” exceptional 
        “cuttings.” I have carefully chosen these two terms to label Rukeyser’s 
        papers because they recall the fact that, as a young woman, she worked 
        occasionally as a film cutter, and that at the very end of her life, she 
        said <i>Findings</i> would be the title of her next book.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rukeyser’s papers are “cuttings,” “findings,” where 
        aesthetic and poetic themes are explored; where political topics are debated; 
        and where, surprisingly, the field of feminist discourse, sexual identity 
        and gender roles is hardly tackled. The only item I found on the role 
        of the “woman worker” is the carbon copy of a long essay entitled “Women 
        and Scottsboro,” <A HREF="#_edn7"NAME="_ednref7">[7]</a> which we can 
        appreciate not only for its social, political, economic arguments, but 
        also for “the generosity of meaning and the gifts of the imagination” 
        <A HREF="#_edn8"NAME="_ednref8">[8]</a>:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">The women who have played 
          important parts in the Scottsboro case are spectacular contrasts. There 
          are the two pairs: on the one side, the mothers who have been most prominent, 
          Ada Wright and Janie Patterson, who have seen the slow sacrifice of 
          their sons to a deepening class struggle; and, on the other, the two 
          women who have led the boys to conviction, Ruby Bates and Victoria Price. 
          Behind one pair stand the other mothers, and all conscious women workers 
          - behind the other are grouped the ignorance and vulgarity of the bourgeoisie 
          and the prejudice of the group that used to be referred to delicately 
          as “the flower of Southern womanhood” .…<br>
          The town-women of Decatur are divided in feeling. Most of them, the 
          crisp leisure class, the office-workers, waitresses, are indifferent. 
          When they do express an opinion, it is ingrained with prejudice ….<br>
          The Negro women of the town appear in numbers in and around the courtroom, 
          and these numbers are an index of their strength. The working woman’s 
          strength is an important factor in the case ….<br>
          Indeed, the fundamental issues of the Scottsboro case are more clearly 
          tied up with the problems of the woman worker than has been pointed 
          out. The fact that the boys were dependent on their mothers in Atlanta 
          and Chattanooga when they were sent by freight to look for jobs; the 
          fact that prostitution has played so large a part, socially and in the 
          case … ; all these should bring the case home to the woman worker.<br>
          Our problem in the remainder of the battle is one of organizing and 
          educating. In the North, we can rally, protest, be our classes’ voice. 
          In the South, there is even more to do: the century-long prejudices 
          must be fought even harder, the old cry of “rape! rape!” whenever a 
          Negro is to be persecuted must be drowned out, the whole problem of 
          employment for women must be examined, the facts of prostitution made 
          clear ….<br>
          The case has long ago become the property of the working class. The 
          woman worker must accept its problems and devote her energies to further 
          the fight to free the Scottsboro boys, and to solve the problems which 
          have led to their condemnation. <A HREF="#_edn9"NAME="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If we grasp the articulated relation of Rukeyser’s 
        “cuttings” and “findings,” we can reconstruct her connections with the 
        political-literary movements of the period. We can evince how her leftist 
        orientation did not mature through studying party doctrine, but through 
        responding to public injustices; and we can understand why she encouraged 
        the most important tendencies of modernism, while challenging them. One 
        of the “cuttings” which is not dated, but that, by means of internal evidence, 
        might be assigned to the period under scrutiny, is the one about Käthe 
        Kollwitz’s life and art. It is a document that helps illustrate the links 
        of our research—the relations between different cultures, between Europe 
        and the United States—while giving a concrete example of a brave German 
        woman sending “signs” across vast distances, <A HREF="#_edn10"NAME="_ednref10">[10]</a> 
        of a brave American woman ready to catch, to follow, to develop those 
        “signs” <A HREF="#_edn11"NAME="_ednref11">[11]</a>:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">… Käthe Kollwitz has made drawings, etchings, wood 
          cuts, lithographs and sculptures, with a passionate conviction which 
          cuts into men’s minds and hearts….<br>
          Kollwitz has always been spiritually close to the human endeavor of 
          the United States—the popular democratic form of expression of broad, 
          human values….<br>
          Her theme is always humanity suffering, oppressed, menaced by starvation 
          and death. She dealt in the “Bauernkrieg” with the struggle of the oppressed 
          to right their wrongs. Before the World War she concerned herself with 
          the life she knew best—poor mothers who came to her husband’s clinic, 
          dead children, posters against syphilis and. alcoholism, for playgrounds 
          for children. After the war she portrayed the waste and ruin caused 
          by the war. She did a large monument at Eessen near Dixmuiden to her 
          son Peter who fell there in 1914, showing a bereaved mother and. father, 
          herself and her husband.<br>
          Her art speaks for all human beings who ask of life the freedom to live, 
          the right to survive.<br>
          Her women, starving children, wounded men plead for life. They receive 
          hunger, empty hands which hold no bread or hands which thrust weapons 
          of death.<br>
          The Nazis had Kollwitz ejected from the Prussian Academy; they forbade 
          all exhibition and sale of her work ….<br>
          Kollwitz has taken on the stature of an artist of the people of every 
          country.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These lines are personal notes that reveal how Rukeyser 
        “listened” to Kollwitz’s thoughts and feelings, as they were expressed 
        through her art. <A HREF="#_edn12"NAME="_ednref12">[12]</a> They also 
        confirm her understanding of the powerful relationships that exist between 
        history, consciousness and creativity. They disclose a consistent ethics 
        underlying all of her activism and poetry; her way of saying, through 
        the signals of a German artist’s life and work, that the struggle, although 
        it cannot be concluded or completed by one single person, should never 
        be abandoned—a well known talmudic quotation that has become a typical 
        Jewish principle. The dominant idea fixed on paper—the overall precise 
        message in these notes that Rukeyser typed on Kollwitz—is for herself 
        and it is quite clear: experience / believe / communicate / act.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>5. “Nourish beginnings, let us nourish beginnings. 
        / The blessing is in the seed”</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The experience that led Rukeyser to believe, to communicate, 
        to act, had started early. In 1932 at the age of 18, she founded a little 
        magazine, <i>Housatonic</i>; in the same year, she was arrested at the 
        trial of the Scottsboro boys, in Decatur, Alabama; at 21 she published 
        her first collection of poetry, <i>Theory of Flight</i> <A HREF="#_edn13"NAME="_ednref13">[13]</a>; 
        early in 1936 she visited Gauley Bridge, West Virginia, to gather information 
        on an industrial disaster that left hundreds of miners dead and disabled 
        from silicosis. Her contribution to that national drama was “The Book 
        of the Dead,” a formally experimental long poem that integrates legal, 
        medical and personal testimony with lyrical language, and in which, according 
        to Kate Daniels, “she was perfectly capable of combining social-realist 
        techniques with those of high modernism.” <A HREF="#_edn14"NAME="_ednref14">[14]</a> 
        Later in 1936, she was sent to Spain by <i>Life and Letters To-day</i>, 
        to cover the Anti-Fascist Olympic Games (or the Workers’ Olympiad, set 
        up in opposition to the official Olympics in Berlin); but she learned 
        upon arrival that the games could not be held, since war had broken out 
        in the province of Catalonia. The Catalan government decided to send all 
        foreigners home, unless they had experience in nursing or child-care or 
        were willing to fight. Rukeyser had only a first book of poems—she was 
        asked to leave. Her memory from her days in Spain was published in London 
        as “Barcelona, 1936.” <A HREF="#_edn15"NAME="_ednref15">[15]</a> Here 
        is the final stretch of the text, marking the intersection of the essay’s 
        aesthetic, psychological and political concerns: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">But now Martin, his square 
          face with the heavy yellow eyebrows large over the crowd, was shouting 
          to a mass meeting:<br>
          “The athletes came to attend the People’s Olympiad, but have been privileged 
          to stay to see the beautiful and great victory of the people in Catalonia 
          and Spain!<br>
          “These have come for games, but have remained for the greater Front, 
          in battle and in triumph!<br>
          “Now they must leave, they must go back to their own countries, but 
          they will carry to them...<br>
          (the tense sunlit square, Martin about to start for Saragossa, the people 
          shouting ‘Viva!’ in the streets, the friends among workers, the soldiers 
          who stopped to talk to foreigners, the salutes, international and strong)<br>
          they will carry to their own countries, some of them still oppressed 
          and under fascism and military terror, to the working people of the 
          world, the story of what they see now in Spain.” <A HREF="#_edn16"NAME="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It was the moment when all foreigners were being 
        asked to leave the embattled city. Rukeyser felt as though Martin, the 
        organizer of the Games, spoke directly to her, giving her the task of 
        witnessing. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Witnessing, a word heavy with spiritual and legal 
        tones of obligation, is the vocation that Rukeyser accepts in Barcelona 
        and that will impel her to repeat that “story” in different forms. Even 
        in the opening scene of <i>The Life of Poetry</i>, she will recall that 
        struggle against fascism, and will conclude the introduction to the book 
        with this profession of faith: “Then I began to say what I believe.” <A HREF="#_edn17"NAME="_ednref17">[17]</a> 
        From that “moment of proof,” <A HREF="#_edn18"NAME="_ednref18">[18]</a> 
        she said what she believed. From that “moment of proof” she was at the 
        center of an intense network of political, cultural, literary initiatives.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>6. “Facing and communicating, that will be our 
        life, in the world and in poetry”</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Before analyzing the documents that will demonstrate 
        this intense network, let us understand why Rukeyser was sent to Spain 
        by <i>Life and Letters To-day</i>, and started contributing to that journal. 
        While “exploring” Rukeyser’s papers I came across a few letters by Robert 
        Herring <A HREF="#_edn19"NAME="_ednref19">[19]</a> and a precious letter 
        by Bryher dated 3 July 1936, <A HREF="#_edn20"NAME="_ednref20">[20]</a> 
        sent from Villa Kenwin, Vevey (Switzerland). <A HREF="#_edn21"NAME="_ednref21">[21]</a> 
        This epistle is probably not the only direct “link” between the two Jewish 
        intellectuals, but it is the only one I found. It is certainly a fundamental 
        “locality” combining several threads of our research:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Dear Miss Rukeyser,</p>
        <p>I have meant for a long while to write to you about your poems, for 
          I found the volume by far the most interesting, of any of the newer 
          groups which I have read. Only if I like a book or a poem, I like it, 
          and hate having to search round for words to say why I liked it. And 
          I’m afraid if I wait again to think this out, I shall never write to 
          you now, and I would like to put you in touch, if I can, with one or 
          two people in London. <A HREF="#_edn22"NAME="_ednref22">[22]</a><br>
          I hope we can meet. I shall be over about July 20th. In the meantime 
          you should certainly see… Dorothy Richardson, if she is again in London, 
          my last news was that she was still in Cornwall ….<br>
          I expect that you will find London very strange. I have lived, really 
          lived, in many countries of Europe, and have been three times to the 
          States, but I assure you that if you are puzzled, think what you would 
          do in the States in like circumstance, and you can be almost certain 
          the English will do the exact opposite. I have been wondering for years 
          why, but I do notice that if you break the English away too much from 
          their habits and traditions, they make no progress. I suppose it is 
          something to do with islands….<br>
          Dorothy Richardson’s [address] is, Mrs. A. E. Odle, 32 Queen’s Terrace, 
          London N. W. 8….<br>
          I hope so much that we, ourselves, can meet.<br>
          With all best wishes,<br>
          Bryher<br>
          If you are interested in politics, as I imagine from your book, you 
          ought to go to <br>
          Paris for July 14th. I could give you introductions there. Can you speak 
          French? <br>
          Most of my friends there speak English.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The unconventional beginning of the letter seems 
        to imply that Bryher, like Rukeyser, sees poetry as a realm of possibility, 
        not a kind of artifact. She does not make an adequate critical discourse; 
        nor does she express any precise appreciation of Rukeyser’s stylistic 
        practices, sounds and rhythms patterns, deployment of modernist collage 
        and rapid juxtapositions. But her statement, with the triple repetition 
        of the verb “like,” signals the full acceptance of the American poet within 
        the literary community, and implies an understanding of the potentialities 
        of a writer that had just published her first book, the one starting with 
        the emblematic line “Breathe-in experience, breathe-out poetry.” <A HREF="#_edn23"NAME="_ednref23">[23]</a> 
        This acceptance is reiterated in the handwritten post-scriptum: “If you 
        are interested in politics, as I imagine from your book, you ought to 
        go to Paris for July 14th. I could give you introductions there.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bryher does not use the expressions modern / modernist 
        (or their “siblings,” as Susan Stanford Friedman would say), but simply 
        “newer,” an evaluation marker that seems more projected into the future. 
        The repetition “I hope we can meet” / “I hope so much that we, ourselves, 
        can meet” is implicitly rich in promises: Bryher would introduce Rukeyser 
        into her environment, her cultural setting, into her “life” and “letters.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And she really did. Rukeyser was asked by Bryher 
        and Herring to substitute a journalist who at the very last moment could 
        not go to Spain, to cover the Anti-Fascist Olympic Games for <i>Life and 
        Letters To-day</i>. The following letter, dated 15 July 1936, probably 
        convinced Rukeyser to accept the “proposition”:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p style="text-align:justify">Dear Muriel Rukeyser,</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">….</p>
        <p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">Now, I can’t make Barcelona 
          myself…. But I have a proposition to make. Would <u>you</u> go for us? 
          The company has voted £3O for expenses, etc. … and it is, for us, important 
          to have it covered. The difficulty has been that one wants to know whoever 
          goes is sympathetic….<br>
          You, I think, would be excellent—if you would go. I am in touch with 
          the committee…. I have details of trains and list of hotels. It’s a 
          simple trip—11 from here and next day at noon in Barcelona. Dates are, 
          19th to 26th. I have full programme at [the] office.<br>
          There isn’t much time, so would you call me to-morrow? In the morning 
          I have to go miles out to some conference…. So I shan’t be in till after 
          lunch—would you ring about 3?….<br>
          I’d be so pleased if you felt like it and it would be a relief to know 
          the show was in safe hands. In fact, it’d help us out a lot!<br>
          Yours sincerely,<br>
          Robert Herring</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The sheet of headed paper where the epistle 
        is typewritten presents, on the left hand side, the same logo of the journal, 
        preceded by the line “EDITED BY ROBERT HERRING • PETRIE TOWNSHEND,” with 
        a central dot between the two names. It was not the first official letter 
        that Rukeyser received from <i>Life and Letters To-day</i> and Herring. 
        <A HREF="#_edn24"NAME="_ednref24">[24]</a> A quick message of his, just 
        five days before, had announced something extraordinary that must have 
        thrilled her:</p>

          I have been reading your manuscripts with delight. I congratulate you.

          Bush” and “Lover as Fox”? Many thanks for the grand time I have had 
          reading them.<br>
          I hope to see you again soon….</p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After the “Iberian adventure” <A HREF="#_edn25"NAME="_ednref25">[25]</a> 
        and as soon as Rukeyser sent Herring her “piece” on the Spanish War—“Barcelona, 
        1936”—Herring expressed not only his admiration and gratitude, but showed 
        he was concerned about her emotional response to that event (“you must 
        be feeling a bit of a reaction”; “it must have done a few things”): </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">Dear Muriel, </p>
        <p align="justify">that was fine stuff: I sent it down right away, deeply 
          grateful…. I do appreciate your doing it to time when you must be feeling 
          a bit of a reaction, &amp; I do trust you’ll forgive me for inadvertently 
          landing you in such a trip. You took it with grand outward calm, but 
          it must have done a few things.<br>
          …. if I don’t see you again before you go, best wishes—a quiet trip 
          this time, many thanks &amp; looking forward to the next meeting. …Best 
          luck.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Between the two final words (“Best luck”) and his 
        signature, Herring drew a fist—a very simple and naive sketch—with the 
        same pen and ink he had used for the entire letter. Although undated, 
        that short message was certainly written in August. It was followed by 
        a long handwritten letter dated September 4 where, among other things, 
        the idea of the fist was resumed, and where the new issue of <i>Life and 
        Letters To-day</i> (Vol. 15, No. 5, 1936) was announced: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">The English press, with a few honourable exceptions, 
          the M. G. &amp; the New Statesman, so fearfully fascist—it is a comfort 
          to have <u>your</u> story. I took an ad. in a couple of papers, &amp; 
          also got out a poster as light tribute to your spirit &amp; as a little 
          clenching of fist against fascism. I’m sending you a couple of them, 
          <u>en souvenir.<br>
          </u>You’ll be getting the number along with this. How do you like it? 
          Do you like the new cover? And is the editorial approved?</p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Her story” was referred to in the editorial Robert 
        Herring and Petrie Townshend wrote for that number of <i>Life and Letters 
        To-day</i> <A HREF="#_edn26"NAME="_ednref26">[26]</a>:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">A year ago we expressed our intention of being non-political 
          in these pages and we still feel that our concern is less with the opinions 
          of writers than with the work those inform. But a year ago is a year 
          ago, and it would be useless to maintain now that Spain’s civil war 
          is none of our business. It is everyone’s business. We hope that we 
          speak for our readers as well as for our authors when we say that we 
          consider it impossible to go to press without paying tribute to the 
          courage of the Spanish people fighting in support of their government.…<br>
          For facts which were not given prominence, we refer readers to a letter 
          by Stephen Levy, a conservative, in the August 1<sup>st</sup> issue 
          of our parent paper, The New Statesman, and to the article which we 
          owe to the spirit of a young American poet that we are able to print 
          in this number. <A HREF="#_edn27"NAME="_ednref27">[27]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The article itself was introduced by this editorial 
        note on Rukeyser: “The author left London alone on July 18<sup>th</sup>. 
        She was on the last train to enter Spain after the fighting began and 
        arrived back in London on July 27<sup>th</sup>. This was her first visit 
        to Europe.” Moreover, in the “Notes on Contributors” of that issue, she 
        was presented as follows: “Muriel Rukeyser, who was born in 1913, is author 
        of the well-received <i>Theory of Flight</i>, a first selection of verse 
        published in the Yale Series of Younger Poets. We took occasion of her 
        visiting England to enrol her as contributor and are happy to be introducing 
        in December several of her newest poems to our readers.” </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As a matter of fact, three of Rukeyser’s poems appeared 
        in the Winter issue of <i>Life and Letters To-day</i> <A HREF="#_edn28"NAME="_ednref28">[28]</a> 
        as promised: two were those Robert Herring had already chosen, “Course” 
        and “Burning Bush.” The third was “In Hades, Orpheus.” A politically committed 
        poem—“Elegy”—was published in Vol. 21, No. 19, 1939. <A HREF="#_edn29"NAME="_ednref29">[29]</a> 
        It portrays the dangers of the “age of magicians,” the age of the German, 
        Spanish, Italian dictatorships. <A HREF="#_edn30"NAME="_ednref30">[30]</a> 
        In this way, Rukeyser continued to be consistent with her personal anti-fascist 
        choice and with the ideological attitude of the London journal.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>7. “Women and poets see the truth arrive / Women 
        and poets believe and resist forever”</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The Spanish Civil War was a crucible for Rukeyser, 
        and from that “moment of proof” she was at the center of an intense network 
        of political-literary initiatives, as is evident from the letters of her 
        correspondents. From the American Student Union of New York she received 
        a letter dated 18 September 1936, saying:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">Could you find time before next Friday to rush me a 
          piece on Spain for the first issue of the ADVOCATE? I just noticed that 
          you were back and I’m desperately anxious to get something which will 
          not be merely an editorial or a statement that we are for the loyalists, 
          however worthy the thought.<br>
          You are probably harried and overburdened and therefore I set no maximum 
          or minimum of length—I do want at least an impression and a suggestion 
          of what is happening to the people of Spain.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">From the League of American Writers, and more precisely 
        from its executive secretary, Ellen Blake, she received the following 
        message, dated 5 November 1936: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">I am sorry for the delay—we have been having some trouble 
          finding a hall.<br>
          The meeting is to be held on November 9th, 8:15 p.m., Irving Plaza, 
          15 Irving Place.<br>
          Sherwood Anderson will be chairman. Professor Julian Moreno Lacalle 
          will give the historical background of the struggle; you [and] Eugene

          I could not find out whether any of the others had been in Catalonia. 
          I do know that Schachner saw some of the fighting around Madrid and 
          in the Guadarrama mountains.<br>
          The length of your talk should be approximately 15 minutes.<br>
          Would it be possible for you to get to the hall at 8 p.m.? Sherwood 
          Anderson will be there at that time to meet the speakers.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Harried and overburdened,” Rukeyser would “rush 
        a piece” to those who “desperately” wanted to know the truth about what 
        was “happening to the people of Spain.” She would participate in the meeting, 
        chaired by Sherwood Anderson, and give a speech as a witness of what she 
        had seen at the outbreak of the Spanish War. In this way, she would confirm 
        her belief in the need for social concern on the part of the writers, 
        and in the existence of relations between different domains of knowledge 
        as well as between different experiential realities.</p>
      <p><strong>8. “Through acts, through poems, / through our closeness— / whatever 
        links us in our variousness”</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rukeyser did more within the context of her lifelong 
        commitment to a poetry grounded in historical particularity. In the Berg 
        Collection, I found a booklet—published in 1938 by the “Writers and Artists 
        Committee, Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy” of New York—containing 
        a version of “Mediterranean” <A HREF="#_edn31"NAME="_ednref31">[31]</a> 
        that is slightly different from the original one, printed in <i>New Masses</i> 
        in 1937. The front cover presents one of the etchings entitled “Los Desastres 
        de la Guerra” by Francisco Goya. <A HREF="#_edn32"NAME="_ednref32">[32]</a> 
        On the back cover, the following appeal for funds is printed under the 
        meaningful title Today in Spain: “Eight American hospitals have been established 
        by the Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy. One hundred and thirteen 
        surgeons, nurses and ambulance drivers, with fifty two ambulances and 
        tons of medical equipment are saving hundreds of lives daily. What you 
        contribute today, will receive the heartfelt thanks of a heroic people.” 
        <A HREF="#_edn33"NAME="_ednref33">[33]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Even in this new version, surely written on purpose 
        to contribute to the appeal in favor of the heroic Spanish people, “Mediterranean” 
        remains Rukeyser’s major poem about her experience in Spain, and is a 
        concrete affirmation of her conception of poetic responsibility and poetry 
        as witness. It is an answer to the question which is posed in the poem 
        itself: “Where is the place for poetry?”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Mediterranean” was much praised when it was issued. 
        Horace Gregory previously described the poem “Your book on Spain,” in 
        the letter he wrote Muriel immediately after reading her typescript: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">This is just a line not a letter: the poem is beautiful 
          and fine. It is actually your book on Spain as I had hoped to see it: 
          there it is as only you could write it…. I want to see it in the New 
          Masses (where it sh’d appear) showing people how to write about Spain. 
          I’m really delighted by it; it always cheers me up to read good poetry.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Since Gregory plays a pivotal role in introducing 
        Rukeyser to European intellectuals, his correspondence with her deserves 
        some attention. There are passages in his letters in which he addresses 
        her with such intimacy that the text is almost transformed into a conversation, 
        an unconventional, insistent assertion of connection. <A HREF="#_edn34"NAME="_ednref34">[34]</a> 
        Gregory would tell her what to visit in London, and would ask her opinion 
        about his latest poems. He would put her in touch with T. S. Eliot; he 
        would speak about politics and the heat in New York. Worth quoting here 
        is his letter <A HREF="#_edn35"NAME="_ednref35">[35]</a> dated 3 July<sup> 
        </sup>1936, reminiscent of the letter written by Bryher on the same day 
        (examined earlier):</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">Dearest Muriel<br>
          It’s grand to think of you in St James’s Park…. And I would even suggest 
          the commonplace tourist stunt of seeing the Tower, if only to see the 
          ravens, the only creatures in the place who seem authentic ….<br>
          And I hope you visit Charing Cross where Keats used to make appointments 
          with the Hunt circle of friends, but is now a row of second hand bookstalls 
          and fairy eating houses, coffee shops behind the theatrical district….<br>
          Meanwhile I’m feeling slightly better: and the reason is the enclosed 
          new poem, which has grown indirectly out of the play….<br>
          Do let me know what you think of it and all our love,<br>
          Horace<br>
          I dropped a note to Eliot about you this morning.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is curious how both Bryher and Gregory <A HREF="#_edn36"NAME="_ednref36">[36]</a> 
        wrote letters to Rukeyser, on the same day, commenting on some peculiar 
        aspects of London, suggesting places to visit and which links to establish. 
        Both of them hoped that Rukeyser would meet Dorothy Richardson—but from 
        Richardson herself, writing to Bryher on August 1936, we learn: “we missed, 
        by the way, Muriel Rukeyser, who, when we came back from Essex, had left 
        town.” <A HREF="#_edn37"NAME="_ednref37">[37]</a> In a letter dated November 
        1936, Richardson gave John Cowper Powys more details: “Horace Gregory 
        introduced one Muriel Rukeyser, fresh from Vassar, poet, airwoman &amp; 
        the most vital woman in young America. We waited trembling, &amp;, when 
        this portent wrote, were away staying with friends. Before we returned, 
        she had gone to Spain. So we never saw her.” <A HREF="#_edn38"NAME="_ednref38">[38]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bryher and Gregory are linked to Rukeyser even in 
        Richardson’s correspondence. And the American poet—“placed” or “displaced,” 
        in New York, in London or in Barcelona—appears always at the crossroads 
        of a rich cultural world. She becomes the intersection of a number of 
        different relations, a center of exchanges, as we can realize from a short 
        message H. D. sends her:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">Dear M. R.<br>
          It was kind of you to write me so understandingly. Yes… I have been 
          very busy. One excuse for not having returned your books sooner …. The 
          other is that I lent the volume [Theory of Flight] to people whom I 
          thought would enjoy it… and even, in a way, be useful. The same with 
          the typed poems …. With best thoughts,<br>
          H. D.<br>
          A volume of the poems has been ordered for me!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The letter is undated (on top of it we find only 
        the abbreviation “<u>Thurs</u>.”), but is to be assigned to the weeks 
        Rukeyser spent in London before leaving for Spain. It is handwritten on 
        a very light blue sheet of paper—almost transparent, like her words. The 
        same may be said of a letter written on a “<u>Monday</u>”, that starts 
        with a formal “Dear Miss Rukeyser” (and not with the initials), and ends 
        with a friendly “A bientôt”: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">I only just now hear from Robert H. [Herring], he wants 
          to take us to the Ballet and dinner, Friday. I hope this suits you. 
          Will you come here soon after 6, so we can have a talk before he comes 
          in, about 7?<br>
          I have read your book [<i>Theory of Flight</i>]; it is truly exciting 
          in every sense and makes me feel very provincial and back waterish, 
          get all the same, at one &amp; at home in your atmosphere! I did enjoy 
          seeing you. I have written Bryher as she is a great fan of yours and 
          she may want you to meet friends of hers here.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Epistolary connections, social links, ideal knots, 
        elective affinities. In that Summer of 1936, different representatives 
        of modernism were “net-working” in London.</p>
      <p><strong>9. “When this portent wrote….” </strong></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If one follows the threads connecting Rukeyser to 
        her correspondents, and reads the letters kept at the Berg Collection, 
        one after the other as a continuum, one has the impression of reading 
        a hypertextual epistolary novel where nothing is fictitious. Real are 
        the participants—the members of the literary community—as well as the 
        ideas, the events, the artworks which they present, which they explore, 
        for which they take risks. Real are “those men and women / Brave, setting 
        up signals across vast distances.” Real and brave—engaged in politics, 
        engaged in denouncing social crises, engaged in literary debates—they 
        set up multifaceted signals, giving voice to “the unseen and unborn.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this epistolary novel, Rukeyser’s portrait emerges 
        vividly. And not only her portrait, but the picture of an age. We do not 
        have her letters and can only guess what her thoughts, feelings, concerns, 
        joyful reactions were like. We can imagine how she answered and reacted 
        to a praise or an attack, to the refusal of a sonnet, or to the request 
        of series of poems for publication; how she responded to the “signs” that 
        confirmed her achievements, as well as to the veiled or transparent “signs” 
        that left only scars <A HREF="#_edn39"NAME="_ednref39">[39]</a>; to the 
        “signs” that testified to her being a “mediator” of culture.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Weaving this web of her correspondents’ words (from 
        the most formal to the most confidential letters), we get a sense of the 
        power of her personality, her charm, her humor, her generosity; and we 
        understand how Rukeyser lived on paper, continually exploring and elaborating 
        her key themes of connection and growth, since she believed in growth 
        through connections. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One of the earliest steps in this direction was, 
        I think, the founding of the little magazine <i>Housatonic</i>, on which 
        new details are offered by two “buried” papers of the Berg Collection 
        The first is a circular letter announcing the publication of <i>Housatonic</i> 
        and promoting subscriptions to it:</p>
      <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>HOUSATONIC</p>
      <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>This is a new magazine for and about New England.</p>
      <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>Its purpose is to focus the cultural and economic trends in 
        New England <br>
        life. It will include poems and short stories and articles on the arts 
        and <br>
        industries, people and places of this section of the country. Briefly, 
        we are <br>
        trying to define the New England of today as it has evolved from the past 
        in<br>
        order to see more clearly its promise for the future.</p>
      <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>The editors of Housatonic are asking subscriptions from all 
        who love the<br>
        special artistic background of New England, who are interested in the 
        <br>
        changing occupations of its people, and who are looking to it to carry 
        on the <br>
        pioneer tradition.</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>Housatonic is published at Roxbury, 
        Connecticut, by four Vassar students, <br>
        members of the editorial boards of the college literary magazine and newspaper, 
        <br>
        Eunice Clark, Eleanor Clark, Muriel Rukeyser, with Denise Dryden as Business<br>
        Manager.</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>The price is $1.50 for four issues 
        of Housatonic, published semi-monthly<br>
        beginning July 15th.<br>
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The second “buried” paper is the copy of an ad for 
        <i>New Masses</i> which is accompanied by a letter dated 15 July 1932, 
        signed by its business manager, Frances Strauss, that reads as follows: 
        “Dear Muriel, here is a copy for our ad to appear in your honorable journal. 
        I’m anxious to have a look at your first issue. Thanks for giving us a 
        break in New England.” Rukeyser’s “honorable journal” was, obviously, 
        Housatonic. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The ad presented the following persuasive opening: 
      </p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>50,000 WORKERS<br>
        and intellectuals in America, organized and functioning in revolutionary 
        cultural <br>
        organizations in all sections of the country, have as their spokesman, 
        the 
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>NEW MASSES<br>
        (American Monthly of Revolutionary Art and Literature)</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>Contributors: Theodore Dreiser, 
        Sherwood Anderson, John Dos Passos, Michael <br>
        Gold, Whittaker Chambers, Sam Ornitz, Langston Hughes<br>
        and a talented young group of writers from the mills, mines and factories 
        and <br>
        colleges contribute regularly in stories, articles, poems, reviews.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I want to draw attention to two meaningful aspects 
        of Rukeyser’s connections and growth through connections. In offering 
        to advertise <i>New Masses</i>, she meant to establish a significant link 
        and make a precise choice in the literary-political field. In launching 
        her little magazine in the form we have seen above, she showed the wide 
        range of topics that would be covered by a journal published by four women, 
        who would join political, social, artistic discourses in the same “housatonic” 
        “locality.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We do not know what Rukeyser meant to imply by coining 
        that semantically complex name/adjective as the title of her magazine. 
        I wonder whether she intended to convey several connected ideas, even 
        contradictory, within the same term. Was it a homemade journal? Was the 
        verb atone doing something there? and the adjective atonic, with its double 
        meaning? Was that title just a modernist quirk, where the two terms “house” 
        and “tonic” were yoked by “&amp;”? Was Rukeyser starting to draw interdisciplinary 
        metaphors—as she would be doing in her poetry—from the physics of Willard 
        Gibbs, from the explorations of Elizabethan navigator and naturalist Thomas 
        Hariot, from Native American rituals?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As an open window watching on the culture of modernity 
        beyond boundaries of disciplines, genres and genders, that magazine gave 
        rise to several expectations. <i>New Masses </i>defined it an “honorable 
        journal,” and John Wheelwright, clearly seeing in <i>Housatonic</i> a 
        promising “signal” and a “meeting place,” expressed his approval, by writing 
        a letter dated August 18, 1932: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">Thank you for sending me Housatonic, and for asking 
          me to contribute to it. I enclose a poem in five divisions of which 
          you can use some or all, or none as you see fit. Naturally, I should 
          like to see all of it printed and your large pages would seem to make 
          this possible…<br>
          New England has longly needed a magazine of its own, and my only regret 
          is that you seem to plan only four numbers.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rukeyser really believed in what she was doing, as 
        far as <i>Housatonic</i> is concerned. She wrote Pound a letter <A HREF="#_edn40"NAME="_ednref40">[40]</a> 
        in which, aged only eighteen, she was able to communicate quite a lot 
        about herself and about her addressee, both implicitly and explicitly:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">Dear Ezra Pound,<br>
          … you might say something to us—for us… but, magazine article or not, 
          I’d rather know what you were thinking about our sort of thing…. It’s 
          a place-magazine that speaks about New England….<br>
          Officially, I should be asking you what from your point of vantage, 
          you see happening to New England as the nucleus breaks. Writing for 
          myself I am wanting to write to you, or listen to your talk, after the 
          refractions of books like Margaret Anderson’s and Lincoln Steffen’s—and 
          your own.<br>
          Our attack is from the place-poem, place-magazine side, after the person-poem, 
          person-novel and that all facing the avenue of group-works of one or 
          another sort. Of course the validity of that is questionable. I came 
          into the magazine as somebody who’s been for my eighteen years in New 
          York and subject to that education, wanting to see any one place whole. 
          I wish you would say something about that. And about not wanting to 
          be a short-sighted, long-winded romantic, even about writing, even about 
          inflated causes.<br>
          Words like that are falling leaves turning underfoot.—I would like it 
          if you’d answer—that simply.<br>
          Muriel Rukeyser </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In a peculiar mixture of arrogant and deferential 
        tones, Rukeyser showed she was aware of the multiple aspects of modernism, 
        she was conscious that she could be a networking “link,” while her little 
        magazine could be a networking “place” / “locality” where Pound and other 
        “subjects” could meet.</p>
      <p><strong>10. “For our time depends not on single points of knowledge but 
        on clusters and combinations”</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While writing this essay I have often felt tempted 
        to give a graphic image of Rukeyser’s personal connections and immaterial 
        relations. If only I could draw, I would copy (and magnify) <i>Le Miroir 
        Vivant</i> that Magritte painted in 1928 (and that I have recently seen 
        in Rome), in order to make the reader enjoy the colorful and significant 
        clusters of relations that come out through the cross-lacing of the shattered 
        fragments that belonged to Muriel Rukeyser. I would substitute the terms 
        that Magritte uses in his oil on canvas, and I would first “enter” <i>Housatonic</i> 
        in one of his jagged white/yellow clouds, <i>New Masses</i> in another, 
        and then <i>Poetry</i>, and modern/modernism, and leftist, and revolutionary, 
        and Bryher, and the Spanish War, and Elizabeth Bishop, and Horace Gregory, 
        and Marya Zaturenska, and American Prefaces, and H. D., Robert Herring, 
        Ezra Pound, Klaus Mann, William C. Williams. I would place fascism and 
        nazism together in one of his black clouds. Then, I would insert all sorts 
        of keywords (immaterial relationships) of my research, and more names 
        (personal connections)—chosen among those of Rukeyser’s correspondents—into 
        the clouds, in order to show their dynamic interaction.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Going on with our epistolary novel—for which we can 
        now use my “copy” of <i>Le Miroir Vivant</i>, as an ideal cover <A HREF="#_edn41"NAME="_ednref41">[41]</a>—I 
        will quote stretches of letters signed by different senders, that seem 
        quite meaningful for what they reveal about the literary debate that took 
        place in these “localities” and about Rukeyser being both the object and 
        the subject of that debate.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We know that no discourse is neutral, in the sense 
        that, on the emotional gradient, it expresses different degrees of vicinity 
        or distance towards the addressee and towards the object of discourse. 
        Some of Rukeyser’s correspondents, like Horace Gregory, Theodore C. Wilson 
        and Louis Untermeyer—who had a permanent dialogue and exchange with her—would 
        manifest their “vicinity” towards their addressee under different forms. 
        In a letter dated 24 April 1936, Untermeyer, resorting to irony and to 
        metaphoric images, lent his discourse semantically and visually rich resources, 
        in order to convey the importance of their connection and the pleasure 
        of spending some time together in the near future:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">It was good to leave the feverish atmosphere of the 
          Algonquin bar with its blue nudes and hyper-educated drunks (to say 
          nothing of the haughty Greek god who threw out anyone who spoke above 
          a whisper)—it was good, I say, to… come back to the relative quiet of 
          a lawyer-wife and two small boys recovering from measles. It was here 
          that I found you, so to speak, all over my desk: Your letter; a note 
          about you from the lecturing lady to whom I had sent your book; thanks 
          from Allene Tallmey of Vogue; and two references to you in my columns 
          in the just-published Mercury.<br>
          It seems unlikely that I’ll get back to New York in May. There are two 
          lectures to be delivered… then I must open the farm in the Adirondacks…. 
          Do come anytime after June 1st and before Christmas. Borrow a car. Hitch-hike. 
          Come naked on roller-skates. Paddle your own canoe. Swim, volplane, 
          surf-ride, trek, bicycle, or drive an engine. We’ll meet you in the 
          village—we being two miles in the country—or ask any garage-mechanic, 
          bell-boy, or sheriff. But come. Come with the Gregorys. Come alone. 
          But come.<br>
          Get the idea?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Untermeyer’s messages always reproduce the rhythms 
        of spoken discourse, and his speech seems to be interrupted and resumed 
        continuously, sometimes with the help of questions that do not expect 
        any answer, but only mean to prolong or extend the pleasure of being together, 
        on paper.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Some of the letters that Rukeyser received from Horace 
        Gregory were rich in descriptions and evaluations of episodes concerning 
        the political-literary debate of the time, as the one he wrote from Ireland 
        in 1934, <A HREF="#_edn42"NAME="_ednref42">[42]</a> which concludes with 
        a note of sincere admiration toward his addressee <A HREF="#_edn43"NAME="_ednref43">[43]</a>:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Now, POETRY is actually the only magazine published in America that 
          isn’t hog-tied by stupid gang warfare. HM [Harriet Monroe] respects 
          an honest fight, and God knows, even though many of her prejudices and 
          ideas of what “poetry” is are often wall-eyed, she is the sort of editor 
          who believes that, whenever work is interesting it should be published. 
          Much of what she publishes runs counter to her prejudices…. I see in 
          this present row a hopelessly bad poet trying to make a public issue 
          out of personal resentment; I see HM, an old Tory, finding an excuse 
          to air her political convictions by a blanket attack on Communism, and 
          of course, praising a worthless book…. I hope I haven’t bored you with 
          these platitudes. I could go on all night, because I want you, with 
          the particular talents or gifts you have, to understand my position. 
          You’re among the very few for whom I’d take the trouble to open up at 
          all.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Ted Wilson, after opening his letter dated 25 October 
        1935 with “I was very glad to hear from you that we may use your poem 
        in the December issue,” and after speaking of his own poetry, would entertain 
        Rukeyser by making fun of some “characters” of the time, while revealing 
        his political opinion and consequent “detachment” from Ezra Pound: </p>

        IOWA CITY, IOWA</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">.… I should not want to see the correspondence of Pauline 
          Stephens <A HREF="#_edn44"NAME="_ednref44">[44]</a> and Ezra Pound, 
          the more so that they are, as you say, now in the “explosive period.” 
          Pound himself is none too steady mentally these days, and P.S. is a 
          real weirdie. I think she has a certain kind of violent, twisted talent 
          for satire—as evidenced in her poem in Westminster anth., The Unholy 
          Three, which seemed to me very powerful in its way—but she is too hectic 
          a person to have any dealings with personally, for me at any rate. I 
          called on her last winter in N.Y.C. and since then have been deluged 
          with letters, books, etc. I finally told her (in desperation) that I 
          was ill and could not reply to letters any longer. So she continued 
          to write to comfort me in my extremity!…. Ezra and I have reached the 
          parting of the ways for good. My reply to his book on Mussolini brought 
          on the end which came this  fall amid a torrent of abuse, shrieks, and 
          stuttering typography. “You red bastard, you understand nothing like 
          ’em ALL” sez [sic] Ez. Marianne Moore, who is invariably poised and 
          able to cope with any occurrence by her wit, said to me after seeing 
          Ezra’s recent epistles to me, “Ezra Pound has the mechanics of a somewhat 
          rare firearm.” </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the literary debate taking place in our epistolary 
        novel, Rukeyser happens to be both the object and the subject of that 
        debate. The two letters Babette Deutsch writes while preparing her book, 
        entitled This Modern Poetry, illustrate my point. The first, dated 20 
        June 1935, recites:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="justify">I have in preparation a book entitled THIS MODERN POETRY, 
          which Norton is to publish in the fall, and I wonder whether you would 
          care to send me about half a dozen of your poems—or more if you like—for 
          consideration in connection with what I have to say about the younger 
          moderns. My book is not an anthology, but a work of criticism. As it 
          goes to press shortly I should appreciate an immediate response. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the second letter, dated 9 July 1935, Deutsch 
        states: “The ms. [of your poems] came to me so late that I do not know 
        whether I shall be able to include anything in my text, and may be reduced 
        to a mere mention of your work without quotation. But if I can quote, 
        will you be so good enough to give me your permission to do so?” <A HREF="#_edn45"NAME="_ednref45">[45]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Some of these letters—besides being a source of historical 
        insight into modernist culture, and besides giving a truthful portrait 
        of Rukeyser’s strength, wit, honesty, courage, talent—help discover some 
        clues of her poems, and help define their meanings. Moreover, they let 
        us understand how events initially external to the writer’s personal life 
        became absorbed and then expressed by her reportage and/or by her poetic 
        dialectic; as in the case of the “event” of Gauley Bridge that “became” 
        a poem. When “The Book of the Dead” was issued, Ted Wilson, clearly admiring 
        the continuity that existed between Rukeyser’s artistic creativity and 
        her social commitment, disclosed his opinion in a long letter, dated 22 
        March 1938, of which I quote only a fragment:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify">The “Book of the Dead” is, I think, far and away the 
          best thing you’ve done—the whole thing comes through clearly, sharply, 
          with just the right emphasis at the crucial points, making its point 
          firmly and succinctly and without any waving of arms or forced optimistic 
          conclusion, but for that very reason all the more impressive it seems 
          to me. You have gone an immense way since Theory of Flight—there is 
          no blurring of outline, no immaturity in the conception or handling 
          here…. The “Book of the Dead” is really an achievement. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poem was “really an achievement” because it “extended 
        the document.” <A HREF="#_edn46"NAME="_ednref46">[46]</a> As a contemporary 
        critic has recently made clear, Rukeyser responded to the Gauley Bridge 
        tragedy “with a fierce assertion of modernization’s potential both to 
        empower workers and to inspire a specifically modernist poetry.” <A HREF="#_edn47"NAME="_ednref47">[47]</a> 
        “The Book of the Dead” revealed that she “imagined modernist poetry as 
        a productive dynamic force capable of forging connections, connections 
        that could rescue the casualties of Gauley Bridge from oblivion and charge 
        the event with meaning.” <A HREF="#_edn48"NAME="_ednref48">[48]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After all, some years later, in <i>The Life of Poetry</i>, 
        <A HREF="#_edn49"NAME="_ednref49">[49]</a> she would theorize that the 
        defining feature of modernism across disciplines is an emphasis on relationship, 
        and in the course of an interview, she would make clear how she wished 
        “to live in relationships that are all moving but that have their own 
        stability, a kind of musical stability, a spiritual stability.” <A HREF="#_edn50"NAME="_ednref50">[50]</a></p>

        ‘moment of proof’ for Muriel Rukeyser” and, in particular, what I wrote 
        on some lines of “Mediterranean” (p. 392): “…the lines 122-131, with a 
        ritualistically threefold iteration of a protasis, a prolonged anacoluthon 
        and no apodosis, imply severe, although oblique, criticism of the poets 
        who have retreated to an ‘ivory tower’: ‘If we had not seen fighting, 
        / if we had not looked there / the plane flew low / the plastic ripped 
        by shots / the peasant’s house / if we had stayed in our world / between 
        the table and the desk / between the town and the suburb / slowly disintegration 
        / male and female.’ The next verse paragraph, clearly shaped on a form 
        of isocolon (it has both a parallel rhythmical structure and a parallel 
        argumentative system), emphasizes the contrast between the ‘slow disintegration’ 
        of the poets who have chosen a secluded life in their cities (line 132) 
        and the ‘quick recognition’ of Rukeyser (line 142), that is her acceptance 
        and acknowledgement of the role played by Barcelona in her quest for self-definition.”<br>
        Moreover, in a footnote of the same essay (p. 395), I gave this piece 
        of information: “The phrase ‘ivory tower’ was used in the questionnaire 
        which was submitted to the British writers by the Association of Writers 
        for Intellectual Liberty in England. The questionnaire began with the 
        following statement: ‘It is clear to many of us throughout the whole world 
        that now, as certainly never before, we are determined or compelled to 
        take sides. The equivocal attitude, the Ivory Tower, the paradoxical, 
        the ironic detachment, will no longer do.’ Authors were asked to answer 
        two questions: ‘Are you for, or against, the legal Government and the 
        people of Republican Spain?’, ‘Are you for, or against, Franco and Fascism?’ 
        <i>The Left Review</i>, anxious to show that support for the Loyalists 
        was strong among writers, published the pamphlet <i>Authors Take Sides</i> 
        (1937), in which 127 writers indicated they favored the Spanish Republicans; 
        sixteen others were neutral, and only five were pro-Franco. Approximately 
        similar results were obtained from the questionnaire submitted to American 
        writers. A perfect example of the ‘ivory tower’ poet was T. S. Eliot, 
        who declared that the ‘cause’ was just, but a few writers should remain 
        isolated and aloof from the group effort. He, of course, was one of the 
        ‘aloof’ poets.”<br>

        <A HREF="#_ednref6"NAME="_edn6" >[6]</a> Rukeyser has repeated these concepts 
        several times, but most clearly in the Introduction to her <i>Collected 
        Poems</i> (as regards the idea of “extending the document”) and in <i>The 
        Life of Poetry</i>, p. XI: “The relations of poetry are, for our period, 
        very close to the relations of science. It is not a matter of using the 
        results of science, but of seeing that there is a meeting-place between 
        all the kinds of imagination. Poetry can provide that meeting-place.<br>
        I have attempted to suggest a dynamics of poetry, showing that a poem 
        is not its words or its images, any more than a symphony is its notes 
        or a river its drops of water. Poetry depends on the moving relations 
        within itself. It is an art that lives in time, expressing and evoking 
        the moving relation between the individual consciousness and the world. 
        The work that a poem does is a transfer of human energy, and I think human 
        energy may be defined as consciousness, the capacity to make change in 
        existing conditions. It appears to me that to accept poetry in these meanings 
        would make it possible for people to use it as an “exercise,” an enjoyment 
        of the possibility of dealing with the meanings in the world and in their 
        lives.”<br>

        art in <i>The Life of Poetry</i> (pp. 136-37), by referring to “the Kollwitz 
        of the unforgetting eyes”, and “the starving children of Käthe Kollwitz.” 
        <br>
        <A HREF="#_ednref12"NAME="_edn12" >[12]</a> Many years later, these notes 
        would “become” a poem—that is a “meeting place”—entitled “Käthe Kollwitz” 
        (<i>Collected Poems</i>, pp. 479–84). It is the poem (that is the culmination 
        of Rukeyser’s prolonged study of Kollwitz’ art) which starts with the 
        lines: “Held between wars / my lifetime / among wars, the big hands of 
        the world of death / my lifetime listens to yours,” and that presents 
        the famous epiphanic couplet “What would happen if one woman told the 
        truth about her life? / The world would split open.” On the issue, see 
        my essay “Muriel Rukeyser e Käthe Kollwitz: un confronto di segni,” where 
        I draw a comparison between Rukeyser’s poetic “signs” and Käthe Kollwitz’

        are his letters dated January 8, June 25, July 10, July 15, September 
        4, 1936, a postcard from Prague, dated August 8, 1936, with a post scriptum 
        from Bryher, and an undated letter that—thanks to internal evidence—may 
        be assigned to the same period of time. Some of his letters (and the postcard) 
        are addressed to “Miss Muriel Rukeyser, 325, West End Avenue—New York 
        CITY,” some are addressed to “Miss Rukeyser, Queen Anne’s Mansions, St. 
        James’s Park, S. W. 1.” <br>
        From a letter written by Louis Untermeyer to Rukeyser, on June 8, we understand 
        that she left the United States soon after that date. He wished her: “Bon 
        voyage, Glückliche Reise, Godspeed, and Happy Landing”, added some ironical 
        comments (“The Duchess of Richmond is a steady old tub; the journey by 
        way of Canada has less sea sickness per square mile—or square meal—and 
        you will probably get used to the English language on the way over”) and 
        a “networking” remark: “Send me a postal card from the Tower, and if you 
        would like to meet Sassoon drop him a card and tell him I said so.” <br>

        are too obscure at times. You have here some very good lines coupled with

        This is an example of how Marxist journals, especially the <i>Partisan

      <A HREF="#_ednref42"NAME="_edn42" >[42]</a> As a matter of fact, this letter is simply dated “August 10.” One 
        can evince the year from what Dorothy Richardson writes, on September 
        1934, to John Cowper Powys (Dorothy Richardson, op. cit., pp. 270-71): 
        “We have lately been several times visited by the Horace Gregorys, from 
        New York. Do you by chance know these two courageous little poets? Hard 
        up &amp; both more or less ill, but determined to visit England …. Not 
        content with this much daring, they went to Ireland … on a tramp steamer 
        only to be horrified by the general desolation &amp; abject poverty. The 
        sad strange pilgrimage was brightened by … a rather curious &amp; wonderful 
        meeting with W. B. Yeats .… We liked, &amp; admired, Gregory enormously, 
        not only for his triumph over a truly horrible sort of paralysis—he can 
        hardly walk— …. You should read his book on Lawrence (if you don’t yet 
        know it) I wait for her poems, just now due in book form, to know a little 
        more of her. She is an American-born Russian, remote behind an air of 
        frank communicativeness, very weary &amp; fragile.”<br>

        20, 2002.<br>
        <A HREF="#_ednref44"NAME="_edn44" >[44]</a> In the Berg Collection, I 
        found some letters from Pauline Stephens to Rukeyser, all dated September 
        and October 1935. The one dated September 21 is accompanied by her holograph 
        poem “Smoke,” dedicated to Muriel. The one dated October 10 recites as 
        follows: “When is your book of poetry to be published and issued … as 
        I wish to purchase a copy …. I want to keep in touch with the more modern 
        thought, believing that the moderns, no matter what their special trend 
        of thought, are in kinship with one and other, way above the backbiting 
        conservatives … .” In the New York Public Library I found three small 
        volumes of poems by Pauline Stephens, published respectively in 1934 (36 
        pages), 1936 (32 pages), 1939 (20 pages). The last, entitled Columella; 
        a Peace Offering contains the following poems: “Swastika” (to Chancellor 
        Adolf Hitler), “The Fasces” (to Premier Benito Mussolini) and “España” 
        (to General Francisco Franco).<br>
        <A HREF="#_ednref45"NAME="_edn45" >[45]</a> In <i>This Modern Poetry</i> 
        (London, Faber and Faber, 1936, pp. 252-53), Deutsch’s reference to Rukeyser 
        was eventually “reduced to a mere mention” of her work, “without quotation,” 
        as we can read in the following stretch: “Gregory realizes, as sensitive 
        members of his generation must, that a new conflict is in preparation, 
        and that its issue is doubtful. But he does not despair .… His recent 
        poetry proves that he can still draw courage from the American past. It 
        shows him, above this mad, stricken era, leaning forward to hail a new 
        Atlantis. Nor is he alone in this brave hope.<br>
        Poets are turning away from the personal problem, the private vision, 
        to a more inclusive if not a more profound theme …. Not yet bound by any 
        accepted tradition, sharply aware of their misshapen world, they are better 
        able than their seniors to respond vigorously and immediately to the needs 
        of the moment. Muriel Rukeyser, while indebted to Gregory and also to 
        the younger British poets, seems to be developing a strong authentic voice.”
