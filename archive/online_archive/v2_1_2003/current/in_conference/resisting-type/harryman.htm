        </table>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here 
      we see that the poet is inside of an enclosure, with a door locked from the 
      outside. A plaque that says “poet inside” with an arrow pointing to the locked 
      door tells me that the poet has made something she can’t get out of. Or, like 
      Antigone, she has been put away. The poet is either dead or alive and in either 
      case is not accessible.  Below the enclosure is a tombstone in the shape of 
      a pin one can wear on a shirt pocket with the word <b>Iraqi</b> printed 
      on it. The pin is itself a tomb marked as in memoriam to a poet, Dan Davidson. 
      Dan Davidson is the poet who circulated the Iraqi pins during the Gulf War. 
      I wore the pin during the Gulf War fairly regularly and was the recipient 
      of largely friendly looks and pleasantly unanticipated conversations from 
      mostly Arab immigrant and Arab American shopkeepers of various religions and 
      nationalities. I was also the recipient of curious questions, like are you 
      from Iraq? Or, I didn’t know you were from Iraq! from non-Arab literal minded 
      American types, like parents at my kid’s school who did not understand the 
      meanings of the pin as readily as those from the Middle East. One of the more 
      curious conversations involved a young woman who took the pin to be a kind 
      of confession, a mixed declaration of guilty culpability and coming-out as 
      Iraqi. It was for her an invitation to exchange confidences, hers being that 
      she had an excess of facial hair and that she was terrified that her husband 
      would find out about it. To me this made some sense, when I thought about 
      it from her perspective. I was an Arab with non-Arab features, so I could 
      hide behind my western looks and thereby avoid scrutiny and possible condemnation 
      visited upon other Arab Americans. She, on the other hand, could use a razor 
      to hide threatening gender-confusing physical characteristics, thereby avoiding 
      unsettling scrutiny and possible rejection by her husband.  We were both, 
      in a sense, in the same boat: we had had something to hide until this private 
      moment of mutual outing, even if I hadn’t been deliberately hiding something 
      like she had.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
      people from the Arab speaking world understood the emblem <b>Iraqi</b> 
      as signifying human solidarity with their potential suffering—both as subjects 
      of national prejudice and as people who had personal ties to a world under 
      attack. The pin was also understood as a protest against the U.S. raid on 
      Iraq: a person wearing the pin was understood to align herself with victims 
      of war. It was interesting to see who did and didn’t understand or respond 
      to or responded negatively to Davidson’s signifying game.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
      2 Scene 2:</b>  </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“If 
      I meet a stranger how do I know he is a stranger?” Gertrude Stein</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If this 
      were a performance, I would now redirect your attention to another pod of 
      whatever room we happened to be in. You would find yourself in the middle 
      of a play by Gertrude Stein:</p>
     <P>Performer 
      occupies a formally unoccupied piece of turf</p>
        <P >Second Act: What is the earth<br>
          Second Act: The earth is altogether with or without water.<br>
          Second Act: With or without thunder<br>
          Second Act: No, with or without water.<br>
          Third Act: That is what the earth is with or without water.<br>
          Third Act: And what are people.<br>
          Third Act: People are all over<br>
          Third Act: Do you mean all over<br>
          Third Act: No I do not mean all over.<br>
          Third Act: Do you not do you not mean all over.<br>
          Third Act not necessarily sad. No I do not mean all over the earth and 
          even if I did I would not even if I did have it all over.<br>
          Third Act: Why not<br>
          Third Act: Because not.<br>
          Third Act: Because if the people are all over the earth which they are 
          it is not all over.<br>
          Third Act: Not all over</p>
     <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:150%'>       Please kindly notice that “over” is two syllables and 
      that makes all the trouble. Trouble has two syllables too.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In a 
      performance, what would happen in this juxtaposed use of Stein, whose open-to-interpretation 
      values for the performance of her plays I share, is that the discussion preceding 
      the extract from her play would infect the semantic meaning of her work—an 
      inference would be brought forth that at this present moment a poet behind 
      a locked door, a no longer living poet, Iraqi, and people are connected and 
      that there is a simultaneity made between the word “Iraqi” in my exposition 
      and the word “people” in Stein’s play.  Another way to perform this piece 
      would be to deliver each speech simultaneously. Simultaneity, a value incidentally 
      put forth in the Italian Futurist “Synthetic Theater Manifesto” that “captures 
      the confused fragments of interconnected events encountered in everyday life,” 
      is a tactic that encompasses any number of possible outcomes and is a good 
      device for investigating relationships of text to voice to content to context.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">(…so 
      formal strategies are not married to content—and if you want to hear more 
      about this please ask me after the show.)</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Performer 
      then demonstrates two versions of simultaneity</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
      2 scene 3: </b></p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Senator 
      Byrd: “The American people have a better understanding of the constitution 
      than those who are elected to represent it.”</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
      2 scene 4:</b></p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Further 
      discussion</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
      <b>Iraqi</b> pin allowed or dared anybody who had the nerve to wear 
      it to become an artist, a performance artist. The conversations I had at the 
      time with strangers reminded me of some 70’s performance art, for instance, 
      of some of Eleanor Antin’s public performance work of that period, including 
      a piece called something like <i>the King, Duke, or Earl of San Diego</i>, 
      in which she wandered around in a silly get-up—bowler hat and fake mustache 
      and beard piece, the accoutrements of the archetypal Huck Finn confidence 
      trickster nobility—engaging local folks in conversation. I imagine Antin’s 
      performance as an intervention, meant to disrupt the stranger/neighbor barrier 
      in self-guarded sub(urban) Southern California neighborhoods. Her drag/vaudeville, 
      transparent as it was, was probably intended as a user-friendly way of negotiating 
      conversations through gender divides while demonstrating the loosening of 
      the regulations of gender in public space. I thought, I could/would never 
      walk around in a silly costume to attract attention in this way. Well it turns 
      out that’s true, but not true, at the same time. </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Performer 
      removes <b>Iraqi</b> pin and applies <b>illegal alien</b> pin 
      here.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
      2 scene 5:</b></p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“There 
      is no curtain because it does happen.” Gertrude Stein</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What 
      interested me about the Iraqi pin performance is first that I felt compelled 
      to wear the pin whether I wanted to or not. In fact, I dreaded wearing it 
      just as one dreads the turn of events in a tragedy or melodrama. I the poet 
      like being ignored and keeping my own space in public. Therefore, it challenged 
      me the performer to engage with strangers: I am not constituted to converse 
      with people I don’t know. </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I avoided 
      conversations with parents at my son’s school when I could. The person wearing 
      the pin calls attention to the pin and becomes, by virtue of wearing it, responsible 
      to whatever interpretations of the pin one encounters. </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
      objective of Davidson’s performance was to diffuse the theater of war and 
      to dramatize the real life conflations that lead to the targeting of Iraqi 
      subjects as enemies. As a performer of the pin, one becomes responsible in 
      a local context to major world events. The performer citizen engages in a 
      dialogic meditation that exceeds the limits of conventional narrative and 
      argumentation as she becomes aware of her personhood stripped of reductive 
      theatrics and narratives of identity. As with much performance art of the 
      70’s, Davidson’s work is partly about the performer’s experience itself; and 
      like the performance values of the modernist avant-garde, it assertively provokes 
      a response to emerging states of affairs. It is combative and sociable, inward 
      and outward looking, dialogic and positional.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
      3 Scene 1: </b></p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Senator 
      Byrd: “Perhaps it is that the citizen’s understanding is not filtered through 
      the prism of election year politics.”</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Yet, 
      the challenge of writing anything has been at stake for me since the U.S. 
      response to 9/11 became an excuse to militarize against Iraq. The pleasure 
      in the idea that I could be writing about my own art activity and its genre 
      excesses is contradicted by the loss of a sense of what? Form? Desire? Motivation? 
      What do I mean by a loss of a sense of form-desire? And might this then be 
      the very place to begin talking about the text as written for the page and 
      as written for performance and is there a difference? Or perhaps what I am 
      experiencing is not exactly a loss of a sense of form-motivation, but the 
      signal of a breaking point. </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Scene 
      2 Act 3:</b></p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What 
      comes first, the poetry or the theater? What comes first, the poetry or the 
      prose?  First the discourse or the poetry?  The essay or the story?  Narrative 
      or the non-narrative? What comes first, the embodied word or the thrown object? 
      What comes first, the object or the subject? Subject eating the object or 
      the object absorbing the subject? </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What 
      is emphasized, the skeleton or the muscle?</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I would 
      prefer to emphasize the skeleton. I would prefer the movement to be the movement 
      of the muscles lifted by the skeleton. When the muscles are not lifted by 
      the skeleton they become athletic. One becomes aggressive and competitive. 
      The theater becomes a theater of conflict. And somebody has to win.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Mis 
      en scene</i>:  A redistribution 
      of language as testing ground </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
      4: The Middle:</b></p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1982, 
      I wrote an experimental essay, which, now that I look back at it, points to 
      the problem of answering this question about resisting type. </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
      book begins with three short paragraphs:</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Who 
      limits herself to “All I can say. All I can say” gives herself over to a kind 
      of conservatism.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This 
      oblique judgment or observation is mystifying to me. But it is very much part 
      of what interests me.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Characterizing 
      the middle where what’s enlarged (subjective) and what’s reduced (external) 
      by speaking gather.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
      circumambient considerations of this anti-manifesto, <i>The Middle</i>, involve 
      a critique of tragedy and fated, or unidirectional causal narratives, a preference 
      for comedy and playfulness e.g. multiplicity and change, and a performative 
      display of the values for mediating between the abyss of “expressive” subjectivity 
      (hyper self-awareness to the exclusion of the world) and the reduced value 
      of external reality that the intensification of subjective expressivity can 
      entail.  The 22 pages of <i>The Middle</i>—what I am calling here an anti-manifesto—is 
      composed in the following sub-genres and styles, understanding here that sub-genre 
      and style are conflated: aphoristic prose, story telling, the genre of elaborate 
      and prolonged citation, the genre of fake citation, collage appropriation, 
      drama, dialogue, <i>recit</i>, prose poetry, faked poetry (that which imitates 
      another’s style almost effectively), and false autobiography. The essay is 
      art but it is not purely a fictional or poetic essay and thus it has also 
      conflated art and analytic discourse, as have numerous of my other writings.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is 
      a little impossible to construct a narrative by which one can pigeonhole the 
      writing, or stabilize it, long enough to be able to say that it ever went 
      from any one genre to another. My approach to writing <i>per se</i> has elicited 
      its variation in genre. </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Notes to the director </b>of <i>The Ear of the Poet in the Mouth of 
      the Performer</i>:</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">First 
      you will have to decide whether or not this is indeed a play or a performance 
      of any kind. Once you have made this decision, consider the following:</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I sometimes 
      call the kind of theater I do (and sometimes dream about. but don’t do) “poet’s 
      theater” after the American traditions of poet’s theater from T.S. Elliot 
      to Frank O’Hara, after the longer tradition of theater written as poetry, 
      and after the San Francisco Bay Area Poet’s Theater I took part in from 1978-1984 
      or so and have more recently refigured in a broader interdisciplinary context.  
      I could also call it avant-garde performance, a kind of performance that recognizes 
      the sources and values of early 20th c. performance art of Futurism, Constructivism, 
      Dada, Surrealism, Bauhaus, and Gertrude Stein. What I retain of this earlier 
      avant-garde is not a preservation through imitation or slavish copying but 
      an interest—an interest in using live performance as a mode of exploring new 
      ideas or ideas that are difficult, provisional, anti-tragic, in the mode of 
      becoming, on the way, emerging.  </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My earlier 
      demonstrative discussion of Dan Davidson’s <b>Iraqi </b>pin indicates 
      something about the intersection between the practice of poetry and performance 
      art that leads to an approach to poet’s theater. However, what is most important 
      to me, as a playwright, is the performative deployment of language in live 
      space. It is language that is itself character, activity, or event of all 
      of my plays. In this sense, the plays are not dissimilar from my other writing.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Each 
      of my plays assumes a different set of problems in respect to language and 
      performance. And a criteria for my plays thus far has been that they have 
      to have an autonomous integrity on the page apart from performance. Since 
      I think paradoxically about the question of autonomy, e.g. “ìt never wins,” 
      I am interested in making plays that in addition to having autonomous integrity 
      as written literary work, must be recreated from scratch each time they are 
      staged.  The staging is never an illustration of the text just as the visual 
      elements of the <i>mis en scene </i>are never made to illustrate the action 
      or meaning of the play. </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Of this 
      play and essay, <i>The Ear of the Poet in the Mouth of the Performer</i>, 
      the director will need to understand that its site(s) are not an actual locality: 
      it exists in both discursive and referential space. It is to be situated as 
      the work of a political activist, and it is addressing a kind of homework 
      assignment for authors. The bias of the text is that political activism is 
      necessary to the artist (even if not the artist identified as “author”) and 
      that the homework assignment is peculiarly a kind of medium that allows that 
      artist or (did I mean activist?) to communicate with friends, colleagues, 
      and others who want to think about the maker’s relationship to, yes, medium, 
      and yes, genre. </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">So rather 
      than creating a boring <i>mis en scene </i>with chalk, blackboard, podium 
      and the other trappings of pedagogy representing the academic community and 
      with this site in juxtaposition (juxtaposition being another futurist theater 
      strategy) with a political site represented by some kind of didactic style 
      sign system of pins, posters, and banner waving, I suggest the following: 
      imagine an ear and a mouth, imagine a poet and a performer. Imagine nothing 
      or what you want to or Senator Byrd’s filibuster and then imagine anybody 
      who might be willing to consider active protest and civil disobedience as 
      an appropriate response to the forthcoming war. Begin counting and do not 
      be afraid to play telephone or to answer the telephone if it rings when you 
      are counting.  Interruption also counts. If you do as I suggest, you will 
      find a way to direct this play and interpret this essay, and it will not be 
      identical to what you have read on this page.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act

     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Performance 
      has been considered as a way of bringing to life the many formal and conceptual 
      ideas on which the making of art is based. Live gestures have constantly been 
      used as a weapon against the conventions of established art.”  Rose Lee Goldberg 
      </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In her 
      book (now in its 3rd edition) <i>Performance Art</i>, Rose Lee Goldberg begins 
      her survey of the genre with a brief discussion of the early 20th c. avant-garde. 
      Here are some of her claims:</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">1) visual artists, when they have reached an impasse 
          have turned to performance as “a way of breaking down categories and indicating 
          new directions”;<br>
          2) performance has been at the forefront of the activity of breaking away 
          from “successive fields” within the history of the 20th c. avant-garde;<br>
          3) most of the early avant-garde movements tested their ideas in performance.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Goldberg 
      here infers a particular relationship between the art object and performance. 
      A wedge is made between the art object and a performative medium that either 
      breaks down categories of art or becomes a testing ground. Subsequently the 
      art object is reinstated—or at least that is her inference—and if one looks 
      at the history of performance art from an art historical perspective, that 
      narrative works to some extent. The place for performance within her discussion 
      then is a provisional place.</p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">An extension 
      of this would be that the performance medium become a more permanent or significant 
      testing ground—that the performance that tests ideas comes to exist as an 
      object <i>per se</i>, or that it exists more legitimately in an in-between 
      position: one that in part fulfills a provisional role, one directed toward 
      the completion of the art object—as a thing in itself, and one that in part 
      fulfills an open-ended, non-objective mobile role that is exploratory, improvisatory, 
      and that takes language as a medium as seriously as it does the other mediums 
      of innovative theater that have superseded language.</p>

     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“If 
      God’s on our side, he’ll stop the next war.”  Bob Dylan</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This is not what I would have written three or four 
          days ago or a month ago, nor what I might have written today. I gave myself 
          two days to assemble the many thoughts I have had on the topic of resisting 
          type. And these are what they are as recorded on October 12, 2002, one 
          day following the senate vote and the day that my son, having turned 18, 
          has become by law required to give his name to the selective service. 
        </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And 
      so. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">You want to know how and why I write plays when I’m 
          a what? Well, I have figured that since all writing is difficult, any 
          mode is equally available to me. This may be a ruse, but it works. Therefore, 
          I do not decide “now I am going to write a play”—well, unless I have some 
          kind of contract or invitation in advance. What I do is, I think, hmmm…there 
          are all of these postwar French writings, like those of George Perec, 
          that deal with the quotidian. Since the quotidian is a philosophical concept 
          about what philosophy can’t handle, it seems like a great point of entry 
          for a work. A gigantic space opens where anything can happen. So I open 
          a book by Graham Greene because he likes adventure <i>a l’homme </i>(the 
          exotic quotidian) and I get this passage:  “Neither the Spanish costume, 
          which is designed for a flamenco dancer, nor the elaborate headgear is 
          inconspicuous,” and I’m off and running, running circles around gesture 
          and gender and literariness (welcome into this discrete world, <i>La Quotidienne</i>) 
          and it’s all getting acted out by this kind of supplementary excitement—the 
          words are running away with the words—and when that happens, I might decide 
          it’s theater—I can hear this in live space spoken by someone, ideally 
          a cartoon figure in a human body that enjoys being a cartoon when it is 
          not rehearsing for <i>Antigone</i>, or <i>Medea</i>, or <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

        <p  CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>BIO: Carla Harryman</b>’s two experimental novels, <i>Gardener 
      of Stars</i> and <i>The Words: after Carl Sandburg’s Rootabaga Stories and 
      Jean-Paul Sartre </i>are explorations of the paradise and wastelands of utopian 
      desire. Other works include selected writings, <i>There Never Was a Rose without 
      a Thorn</i> (1995) and <i>Animal Instincts</i> (1989). Working extensively 
      in performance, and experimental theater, she has collaborated with visual 
      artists and composers. Her recent play, <i>Performing Objects Stationed in 
      the Sub World,</i> was commissioned by the Oxford-Brookes University's Poetry 
      Center Colloquium, where it was staged (2001) as a reading, later performed 
      at Zeitgeist Theater (Detroit) and the LAB in San Francisco. “Residues or 
      Revolutions of the Languages of Acker and Artaud” will appear in the critical 
      anthology, <i>Devouring Institutions: the Writing of Kathy Acker</i>. Harryman
