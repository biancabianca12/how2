              <P>“I have always had a weakness for donkeys.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — Robert Bresson
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">1.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Two 
      years ago I completed a series of short novels that I had begun thirty years 
      before.  Five of them are set in Boston; and five of them in California and 
      one takes place almost entirely in Ireland on the brink of the Second World 
      War; all of them focus on deracinated women, the youngest in Nod, the oldest 
      in Indivisible.  They add up to one body of work.  When it was done, I knew 
      it.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These 
      books were failures on the marketplace so in fact their fates mimicked the 
      fates of their subjects.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I can’t 
      say that they were experiments but chops and grabs at moments in time, attempts 
      at discovering emotional sequence—that is, the rhythm that flows between the 
      arrival of a moment and its disappearance.  They were like notes for another 
      genre.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">2.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Years 
      before I had read two books, <i>Film Form</i> and <i>Film Sense</i>, by Eisenstein, 
      and these helped me legitimize the process I was already engaged in.  In his 
      chapter on montage he determined that the tonality of a work is established 
      by a rhythmic relationship between its segments.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">He noted 
      that in music the distance of separation between intervals can be so great 
      that it leads to a collapse inside the organic body of sound.  However, its 
      irregularity usually becomes its dynamism.  Like a healthy human heartbeat, 
      which has an intrinsic irregular system, the body of an artwork gets its vitality 
      from a rhythm based in uncertainty.  (Sick hearts have a dull regular thump.)</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Eisenstein 
      believed that there is a social mission for artists—that is, the purpose of 
      any work is to “make manifest the contradictions of Being” and this way to 
      harmonize them, if only temporarily, in the single mind of the viewer/reader.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">His 
      notes on juxtaposition and composition reassured me, because I was working 
      already out of the very far and very near.  I was aware of the wasteland of 
      potential plot that lay outside the margins of my stories and the strange 
      nature of choice in the construction of a narrative.  I used to spread the 
      final draft, sheet by sheet, on floors all over the house and move them around.  
      This way an eruption of action became a self-contained section.  But of course 
      the floors and the air were bigger than all those papers.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Because 
      of the accidents of when and where I grew up, some of the first movies I saw 
      were made by Bergman, Visconti, Rossellini, Fellini and the French New Wave.  
      Janus Films were premiered at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge.  They were 
      all foreign and subtitled. Black and white and speckled with stars and radiant 
      dust.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">They 
      were the remnants of the War, barely separable from the news that was broadcast 
      in movie theaters along with the main feature, and the cartoons.  The blurry 
      subtitles, white on white, oddly selected from the conversation taking place 
      on screen, would come to me as a kind of poetry, scraps fallen from the divine 
      table of babbling tongues.  These half-understood movies were the model of 
      a contemporary fiction because the future inherent in my own stories was only 
      half-known.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Weirdly 
      I didn’t realize this.  Instead I relentlessly pursued a written fiction that 
      had as its model something foreign, half-expressed and highly visual, without 
      ever asking:  Is this an outline for a movie?  Do I have to make the movie 
      if I have just written it?</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My novels 
      were failures undoubtedly because they were not novels.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Conventional 
      (and wonderful) narrative that knows where it is going is like a farmer setting 
      out for the daily tread.  It is a form of lifting and carrying to a pre-determined 
      destination.  My kind of story always had an uncertain goal, and it discovered 
      itself only by shedding what it already knew.  It ran without memory.  No 
      one learned from experience.  In this sense each book was seeking a state 
      of innocence.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">3.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
      barn door creaks on its hinges.  A prolonged rasping like the one you hear 
      in working machinery.  It is as if the use it is being put to is giving it 
      a taste of suffering.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
      depressive sound of a buzz-saw or an electric lawn mower.  A refrigerator 
      groaning at night.  Or something like the bare winter trees forming a syntax 
      that looks like a new sheet music.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It isn’t 
      a barn door creaking after all.  It is a donkey’s mechanistic bray.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Then 
      the donkey comes out into the light and stands aside while the children play 
      nearby.  And this is the beginning of <i>Au Hasard, Balthasar</i>.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">About 
      this film the director Robert Bresson remarked in an interview: it is the 
      life of a donkey going through the same steps that you find in a human life—infancy 
      with its caresses, maturity, work, talent, the donkey who is put in a circus 
      and then some time before dying has a transcendent period, and then he does 
      die from the weight of human sins, and he carries gold to the frontiers.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Au Hasard, Balthasar</i> was one of Bresson’s last two black and 
      white films.  A luminous pallor surges out of the screen, spreads over every 
      face and form in the picture, it is the color of consciousness.  The subtitles 
      are ghostly and easily submerged in the background light.  Squalor bleeds 
      into this whiteness.  Blends.  The plot follows an erratic life-line until 
      it is swallowed in bells and pale sheep.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This 
      film and <i>Mouchette </i>were made in the days when the poverty of resources 
      in film-making were complicit in the stories of human poverty and petty crime.  
      There was no separation between equipment and intent.  The sudden shifts in 
      scene, the unschooled acting, and the engagement in a religious view that 
      carries despair to its last point—where an illumination occurs as a convergence 
      between chance and unexalted labor in the direction of love—have made Bresson’s 
      work one of the few examples of art as conversion.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">That 
      is, the whole movie’s message, its method, its tools function in harmony.  
      The donkey is the hero.  He is the film.  He seems as blind as chance.  Only 
      once is there a scene where the donkey is put in a circus to perform with 
      other long-suffering animals and there is an unblinking exchange of glances 
      among them.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Otherwise 
      the film is at the end what it was at the beginning—astonished.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">4.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My decision 
      to try making videos seven years before I stopped writing fiction was really 
      a desire to escape words and face the world.  First I bought a pixilated Fisher 
      Price toy camcorder that I carried all around the outdoors with me, taking 
      moving pictures of shadows, light, trees, etc.  It was a completely private 
      activity.  And it rewarded me with the adamant silence of creation in its 
      deep dream state.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I felt 
      as if I was carrying a baby on my arm, a baby that was accumulating know-how 
      and so I bought a heavier camcorder, a Sony, and took loads of pictures to 
      store up for later use.  A filmmaker friend began leading me around showing 
      me how to use a super 8 camera and after awhile he and I together made a picture 
      called <i>What Nobody Saw</i>.  We had actors, we had a script, and we all 
      roamed around together inventing according to our surroundings. The open-endedness 
      of the process was pleasurable to me.  Anything that happened only did so 
      because it could. </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Without 
      words, the passage of birds, boats, buses, bags and planes stood in for words.  
      As far as the eye could see, a logic was returned.  But it wasn’t the logic 
      of plot or premise.  It was truly a combination of pre-determined relations 
      and chance encounters.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Simone 
      Weil once remarked, “The beings I love are creatures.  They are born by chance.”  
      It is this relationship to chance that seemed to me profound and pronounced 
      in filming.  It was a liberation from the backward-tendence of writing and 
      rewriting.  On film a donkey is just a donkey.  Even if the fur on its back 
      forms a Cross, it exists in time, is used up by time and labor, and lives 
      in blind subjugation to its fate.  It does not carry a necessary set of premises 
      and arguments along with it.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Sentences 
      and plots for a time seemed dangerous to me, an extension of closed potential, 
      of socialization.  My impulsiveness seemed to fizzle through excess scheming 
      as the life of a nation does.  When I had a chance to break free, the laws 
      of grammar restrained me.  Unfulfilled gestures and cries were excluded from 
      this ”government of words.”  It was what did NOT happen that haunted me in 
      writing, the way the air is more solid than anything in it.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Work 
      that could exist in and emerge from uncertainty, as some music does, seemed 
      both more daring and more realistic than literature.  It was like Eisenstein’s 
      commitment to the intervals and separations that create form.  The blindness 
      that loads our days seemed to have a better chance of being grasped if it 
      could, ironically, and without irony, be seen.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">So I 
      made some more short videos and am about to begin working again with my old 
      pixilated camera whose batteries don’t work.  I will be trapped by the need 
      for a plug, a wall and a light from a window.  I will play it back and see 
      myriad unnoticed shadows, shapes and gestures from people who happen to pass 
      by.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this way I will be limited to chance and liberated 
          by it.  I believe this is the exact paradox that I am chasing, and always 
          was.</p>
