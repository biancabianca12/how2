    <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Kathleen Fraser</P>
    
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This 
        panel was conceived from purely selfish motives.  As a practicing poet for 
        many years, I’ve turned, at different times in my life, to the pursuit of 
        painting, lithography and collage when the language of poetry and its alluring 
        propositions of organization have seemed unavailable or no longer adequate.  
        This errant shift away from the more familiar terrain of written language 
        forms has afforded me—with each departure—that double-edged event of entering 
        into the sheer physicality of the visual world, as well as coming up against 
        its formally-constructed givens.  </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Allowing 
        oneself—in each instance of departure—to take on a less known, unmastered 
        creative activity can be gratifying and frustrating.  But, in my case at least, 
        it has also brought me back to the abandoned materials of a too familiar writing 
        practice, with heightened curiosity and appetite for reconfiguring that earlier 
        language—investing it with structural ideas I’d assigned exclusively to the 
        visual arts.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">At 
        last year’s MSA, Susan McCabe spoke of Elizabeth Bishop’s <i>frottage  </i>technique—involving 
        a tracing and overlay of language fragments akin to the <i>frottage  </i>technique 
        used by Max Ernst —basically “rubbing a pencil on paper over objects in order 
        to defamiliarize them from their ordinary denotation.”  McCabe linked Bishop’s 
        method, in her poem “A Weed,” to Max Ernst’s earlier use of the <i>frottage</i>  
        technique in a small group of prints he entitled <i>Histoire Naturelle</i>.  
        During this discussion, I remembered how right it had seemed to discover in 
        Helen Vendler’s piece on Bishop—published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, years 
        earlier—Bishop’s hands-on engagement with painting.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Scanning 
        my peers, a subculture of genre-departure quickly emerged: poet Barbara Guest 
        turning to the novel with <i>Seeking Air</i>  and her abstract collages and 
        word-painting collaborations, achieved together with painter-friend in their 
        lofts;  poet Clark Coolidge’s comments in a letter, about his parallel practice 
        as a jazz drummer, composing poetry with sound-tracks of  be-bop streaming 
        through his headphones; Norma Cole’s original presence as a painter, shifting—in 
        what seemed like a sudden and absolute departure—to poetry and word collage, 
        as well as translation; and poet Kenwood Elmslie’s cautionary comments re. 
        the precise rigors of writing for musical theatre, how even the most contemporary 
        composers of opera were required to adhere to the conventions demanded of 
        opera <i>libretti</i>… and, subsequently, how his playful, texture-rich collages 
        and postcards turned away from that. </p>
     <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 
        the company of these writers, I’ve become more and more intrigued by the commute 
        between a perhaps more stable or identified writing practice and the departure 
        from that norm.  What happens, I wondered, when the at-first barely acknowledged 
        foreign intrigue becomes a site of equally compelling activity?</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Wanting 
        to hear this question discussed by my own contemporaries, I invited three 
        writers to investigate their relationships to related questions of travel 
        among artistic disciplines and to explore here today what impact that detour 
        or expansion has had on each of their working lives as writer-artists.  How 
        does one genre activity feed and question an/other?  What may  be the unsettling 
        effects and reconfigurations of risk, lure and problem-solving for the writer 
        whose genre-identity has been constructed around reliable materials and working 
        procedures, but who later discovers the need to jump—or divide—into new artistic 
        territory/s as a practitioner? </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Our 
        panelists are Marjorie Welish—poet, painter and art critic; Carla Harryman—experimental 
        novelist, essayist and playwright/director for Poets Theatre; and Fanny Howe—poet 
        and novelist, who began, after writing at least a dozen novels and poem collections, 
        to make video-films in the Nineties.</p>
