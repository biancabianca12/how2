  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">
        <div class=Section1>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What is black and white and read all over?, a question 
            appropriated from a riddle, turns on the semantic confusion between 
            visual and verbal apparatus yet now may suggest that the function of 
            “read” (as in learning or reading) may inform or figure “red” (that 
            is, a color) and not necessarily because an identity finds its coherence 
            through a fixed property for which only one structure obtains: for within 
            mediums there are puns that take effect and are construed in their double 
            identity once the writer, artist, composer, architect, choreographer 
            establishes a<b> local contextual meaning within which an encoded escape 
            is possible</b>. Identity as such in jokes and play may force the issue 
            of hybrid terms and non-synonymous doubling. Identity may be hyphenated. 
            Identity may constellate through a problematic rather than through a 
            particular medium, a problematic for which differing sets of aptitudes 
            and skills concretize research process and even product. Here, then, 
            is a way of understanding how an artist doing both may readily pass 
            from one discipline to another.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The pursuit of poetry and of painting is not necessarily 
            in conflict but may well be<b> functionally synergistic, as substantially 
            productive of creative ideas as is reading to writing</b>. Or as teaching 
            or translating is to writing. In my better moments, the simultaneity 
            of functions will distribute across teaching, writing criticism, and 
            writing a poem or painting a painting, and I consider reading a functionally 
            creative enterprise—as many of us here do. But beyond the reciprocal 
            benefits that accrue with such mobilizing of functions, poetry and painting 
            may not get in each other’s way insofar as certain ideas, being non-specific 
            to either medium, may be realized in both.  Imagine the possibility 
            of, say, <b>the problematic of incommensurate orders</b> as a compositional 
            issue that may range across poetry and painting, or may be pursued in 
            poetry even as the painting be devoted to something else entirely.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Let me demonstrate by reading a couple of shorter 
            poems provoked through my teaching an immersion course in Wallace Stevens’s 
            poetry and poetics (to be found in my book <i>The Annotated “Here” and 
            Selected Poems</i>). For our purposes, note that ringing changes on 
            a theme—the theme of place—in the first instance, distributes in an 
            all-over structure constituted of discrepant doubling; then, in the 
            second instance, distributes a heterogeneity of sentence types to push 
            into the foreground the semantic heterogeneity of a theme. The logic 
            here will be the logics of language for which a post-structuralist querying 
            of the semantics of syntax be an abiding concern.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The ordering in this second poem is a pragmatic order that puts on display 
          not a single cohesive meaning that drives the symbol in Stevens’s poem 
          but a rough relativism: “place” occurs by way of differentiating the term 
          and letting the varieties of sense “fall where they may.”  This, at any 
          rate, what I had set out to do, having noted that the world Stevens would 
          have us acknowledge in “Anecdote of the Jar”—although not in “Thirteen 
          Ways of Looking at a Blackbird”—is a unified vision. A kind of ordering 
          of the world through phenomenological subjectivity in Stevens’s work may 
          have been the provocation but my own work takes as its subject epistemologies 
          that construct a world, over which neither poetry nor painting have exclusive 
          rights.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Switching to painting for the moment, let me demonstrate how similar 
          thought might work in another medium and on its own terms. A painting 
          from the mid 1990s will serve this purpose by showing the heterogeneity 
          of orders packed with as much reference to the literature of art history 
          and theory as does the second of the two poems I just read to its own 
          literature.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <P><i>Small Higher Valley # 9</i>, 1994-5. A montage 
            is a formal device with which poets and painters a century after Cubism 
            are well familiar. For some this is a modern work in the sense that 
            it being a device of devices foregrounds the literariness of reflexivity 
            wherein the grid abruptly reconfigures itself from checkerboard series 
            to disequilibrium and topological slippage—all this across a blank passage… 
            at once a sky, a void and an aporia.  For some the incommensurate orders 
            secreted on the surface, however, express a compositional relativism 
            more akin to post-structural disenfranchisement from unity, and also 
            a post-modern historical and referential gloss on an assumed modern 
            visual priority. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1997, I was asked to be a “line-item” in an institutional grant application 
          to the Trust for Mutual Understanding, which sponsors cultural reciprocity 
          between comparable institutions in America and countries of Eastern yet 
          also Central Europe. Prior to that grant I had given myself a visual template 
          for an epistemological problematic that then became a deliberate project 
          while I lived in Lodz, Poland for six weeks. Reading now from the grant 
          application, I focused on the <b>problematic of incommensurate orders</b> 
          in the following way:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <P>[THE WITHOUT, #1] the project concerns composing 
            works whose difference in structure is that between a red, yellow, and 
            blue passage confronting a passage in black and white—a dramatic difference 
            if there ever one, given that, the two-color “systems” hold their ground 
            against three-color “systems” and do not readily submit to the other.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Incommensurate logics brought into equilibrium are 
          of great interest to me, in part to further the concerns of modern abstraction 
          by opening the givens of modernism to post-structuralist investigations.  
          Last year I took the opportunity to show a triplet of paintings from what 
          developed after this grant. </p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">  To allow for the problematic of Difference-within-Similarity 
          to be much more pronounced—indeed, made radical—from canvas to canvas, 
          this series enables local contextual situations to establish the linguistic 
          rules, rules then exercised for their potential: rules established meanwhile 
          to show how a non-verbal set may act as an interpretant—in Peirce’s term—for 
          an individual member of the set. The series THE WITHOUT constitutes an 
          open work for an open investigation. Related canvases shown at the Baumgartner 
          Gallery in New York brought about my current gallery affiliation.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>How does passing from poetry to painting and back again foreground 
          new questions?</b>  Or, put in other words, how is black and white read…, 
          then reread?  My earlier point centers on the question: how do forms of 
          thought inform poetry, inform painting?  Having said at the outset that 
          the choice of medium does not necessarily drive the conception is another 
          way of saying that certain concerns are not specific to a single medium.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Questions raised include: what is a visual idea?  How may a painting 
          be said to think? Issues of medium mandate that paintings (and visual 
          art in general) not be subject to illustrating poetry.  Much painting 
          one sees is literary in this weak sense—which is why Freud rejected much 
          visual surrealism as off-the-mark and Breton seized happily on Arshile 
          Gorky’s abstract paintings as having understood the principle of metamorphosis 
          better than had many surrealists. (Much art one sees published in literary 
          journals, by the way, is less visually sophisticated on this matter than 
          ought to be given the claims for the poetics.  This topic—on which I have 
          lectured elsewhere—deserves a full discussion beyond the assertion I have 
          just made. I shall however further say by way of explanation for this 
          disjunction between visual and verbal literacy in forms that would conjoin 
          them is that this discrepant literacy is so in large measure because those 
          of us who are sighted mistakenly assume that visual literacy is a natural 
          function—that anyone who can see can read for understanding.)</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>How may a painting be said to think?</b>  Whether or not Hubert Damisch 
          articulates it, the strategic model has indeed long informed the narratives 
          contesting for cultural hegemony. The strategic model is in play whenever 
          the problematic takes the form of “What is the legacy of Jackson Pollock?” 
          for the question presupposes that creating art is not historical happenstance 
          but purposive theory that manifests itself through spatial paradigms, 
          at least, this assumption of spatiality as consonant with a mental conception 
          still may be seen presupposed in the writings of Allan Kaprow’s contemplating 
          the problematic left us by Pollock, as much as by Barnett Newman’s trying 
          to take stock of the same modern narrative. Today, architecture much more 
          than painting sustains a strategic model, through the on-going theoretical 
          dialogue with ideas of tectonics warped through language or as a nexus 
          of social forces and defines its significance as such.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These days, too, poetics writes poetry and informs it with strategic 
          high stakes. So passing from one practice to another may indeed make one 
          aware of the incommensurate nature of the discourse wherein theories of 
          art and literature do not translate one to the other. Then, too, the state 
          of the art is more readily discerned once construed as a thought form, 
          but as a mode of thought in a cultural world largely indifferent to poetry 
          and indulgent of painting yet without valuing either.  </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Even as exclusive privilege to form is less and less at issue, questions 
          of medium do emerge</b>. Passing from one discipline to another does foreground 
          assumptions, practical as well as theoretical, and shows these to be decisions 
          open to question. Shuttling between home and studio does at some point 
          raise the question of choice of medium. Why paint?  This question often 
          put to me means: Why paint at all, what is the justification for this 
          obsolete technology?  Although discussing this question as with the question 
          what does it mean for painting to think? leads us to much beyond the time 
          constraints of this panel, an answer to this not specifically tied to 
          my own practice is: Why paint? Why write?   Meaning: given that so many 
          implements of writing have also become obsolete—the most recent of which 
          being the typewriter—<b>do thought forms lose their cogence once their 
          period becomes marked as happening in the past?</b>  The technology of 
          the typewriter having merged with that of computing, however, suggests 
          that writing itself, while transmuted, is still integral to creative practice. 
          Moreover, materials and techniques associated with painting may encode 
          a sort of critique of painting: indeed my diagrammatic painting is becoming—if 
          anything—more so, in order to sharpen the metalanguage.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What is it for painting to think?  might address technology in this way: 
          <b>what technics are required of this thought form to accomplish thus-and-so 
          rhetoric</b>?  Phrased in this way, the key term is not technology so 
          much as reasoning with the medium to plot a certain thought. Under the 
          aegis of this process of stating and restating the problematic several 
          strong solutions will emerge as worthily effective.  This latter is expressive 
          of the principle of<b> indeterminacy in action, where indeterminacy means 
          “degrees of freedom within a system.”</b> Modernist studies is long familiar 
          with this question: the question is that of interpretation where once 
          explanation had had the upper hand. (Postmodernist studies, meanwhile, 
          recognizes the problematic of incommensurate epistemologies as its own.)</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Discourse theory and questions of institutional framing 
          of practices may emerge, then, as one passes from working in one discipline 
          to another.</p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>BIO: Marjorie Welish </b>teaches as an Associated 
          Professor in the graduate Fine arts program at the Pratt Institute, with 
          guest semesters at Brown in the fields of art criticism and literature.  
          Her most recent collection of poems, <i>The Annotated Here,</i> came out 
          in 2002 from Coffee House Press.  Welish’s writing as an art critic is 
          most admirably represented by <i>Signifying Art: Essays on Art after 1960 
          </i>(Cambridge University Press, 1999); and her paintings have been exhibited 
          in NYC over the last decade, most recently by the Baumgartner Gallery.  
          Perhaps the most eloquent homage to the multiple claims of her fiercely 
          attentive eye and ear was the recent day-long conference at University 
          of Pennsylvania in April 2002, addressing Welish’s multi-genre writing/painting 
          production via live and long-distance responses from a multitude of critics 
          and writers, from coast to coast.  These critical appreciations have been 
          collected and will soon be available in print from Slought Press.  <i>Kathleen
