          Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press<br>
          Contemporary Poetics Series <br>

        <p class="doublespace">Recently I happened to watch 
      <i>Libertarias</i>, a Spanish film about the civil war, and was reminded of 
      the optimism that characterized Marxism and anarchism in the early stages 
      of development. This may well be a characteristic shared by all revolutions/revolutionary 
      ideologies in their initial phases, there’s a very moving quotation from an 
      old woman from the Congo upon hearing the good news that God was a loving 
      god: “There now! I was certain in my heart that there is a God like that.” 
      <A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1" >[1]</a> And it struck me that one of the most impressive qualities of <i>Architectural 
      Body</i> is optimism, the delight, even, with which Gins and Arakawa articulate 
      a vision that, like Marxism and Christianity, offers a version of Utopia: 
      “In architecture we have the means to construct awareness on a new basis<i>.</i>”<i> 
      </i>(56) It is “the greatest tool available to our species, both for figuring 
      itself out and for constructing itself differently.” (xxi) Gins and Arakawa 
      write with the conviction that humans can achieve a version of heaven and, 
      like the Marxists, they locate it here on earth. In “Architecture as Hypothesis,” 
      a vision of this new world is presented in an imagined tour conducted by the 
      writers; their guests, Roger and Angela, move beyond their initial skepticism 
      to pleasure, understanding, ease, even expressing ideas that extend their 
      guides’ perceptions.</p>
    <p class="doublespace">Interestingly, the last lines 
      of <i>Libertarias</i> express a vision of the earth renamed Freedom, the exploiters 
      are cast out and there will be an end to death (this is spoken over the dying 
      figure of a feminist/anarchist). Offers of immortality are ubiquitous in religion, 
      less common with ideologies and positively rare in architectural theory. Some 
      readers may choose to see the immortality promised by Gins and Arakawa as 
      metaphorical but this seems to ignore the integral position of “reversible 
      destiny” in the text. This concept is grounded in the importance of preserving 
      life: “That human life is expendable… is antithetical to any ethics putting 
      the highest value of all on the preserving of life.” (xvii) My difficulty 
      with this is that I’m not sure the preservation of life is or should be “highest” 
      in value. I see ethics as a constant negotiation of the claims of a number 
      of values that will not always unanimously point us in one direction. Anything 
      less seems an unwarranted simplification. But this is a qualification, rather 
      than an invalidation, of what Gins and Arakawa have to say, which is much 
      more complex and nuanced; not so much a program for achieving immortality 
      as a treatise exploring fresh and stimulating concepts of philosophy, perception, 
      identity, contingency and some pertinent hints as to what we should be spending 
      our money on.</p>
    <p class="doublespace">Of course, Gins and Arakawa 
      realize how radical their notion of “reversible destiny” is and suggest a 
      less confronting way to understand it — “an open challenge to our species 
      to reinvent itself and to desist from foreclosing on any possibility, even 
      those our contemporaries judge to be impossible.” (xviii) Their optimism comes 
      without the blinkered certainty of the progress paradigm or the trade-offs 
      some religions extort. They joyously and consciously approach their project, 
      which to the average skeptical reader seems impossible; in fact impossibility 
      is not such an obstacle as the (apparently) sheer absurdity of suggesting 
      we could live forever and one asks — can they be serious? They are: serious 
      and joking/laughing — this work/play simultaneous as a child. They invoke 
      the Don, tilting at windmills: “why not indeed build the whole of the world 
      in which those windmills tilt…”. Acknowledging that their “contemporaries 
      look at the two of us as if we were Don Quixotes,” they relish the comparison: 
      “And indeed we tip our hats to a comparable indomitableness, even as we rush 
      to contrast our impossibilities with his. For our part, we never approach 
      anything impossible unless the setup is right.” (xix)</p>
    <p class="doublespace">There is, however, an odd, and 
      potentially problematic conjunction of ideas running through the text. Gins 
      and Arakawa approach identity and perception in a way that could almost be 
      described as common sense, if only it were common. They acknowledge the contingency 
      of personality in their explication of perception and the “organism that persons,” 
      a term used “because it portrays persons as being intermittent and transitory 
      outcomes of co-ordinated forming rather than honest-to-goodness entities.” 
      (2) Humans are no longer to be considered in brooding separation from life: 
      “the body needs to be defined together with that within which it moves… the 
      surroundings need to be defined together with bodies moving within them.” 
      (xx) “Isolating persons from their architectural surrounds leads to a dualism 
      no less pernicious than that of mind and body.” (44) These claims have that 
      rightness that is both old and new; like the best of visionaries, Gins and 
      Arakawa reveal to us what we realize we always knew.</p>
    <p class="doublespace">Their account of perception 
      is subtle and compelling in its conclusions: “Each of us becomes an everywhere 
      evenly distributed agent, dropping the centralizing habit that members of 
      our species have had for such a terribly long time.” (35) As for those who 
      wish to argue that we cannot trust the validity of sensory perception, an 
      argument I’ve always found not only specious but irrelevant — whether or not 
      this chair exists, I still intend to sit on it — Gins and Arakawa are equally 
      disbelieving: “It would also be ridiculous for someone using a flashlight 
      to find the path out of a labyrinthine cave and bumping up against uneven 
      walls and low overhangs or tripping upon rocks and stalagmites and then sliding 
      into and splashing through shallow puddles to wonder if indeed this might 
      be a hollowed-out figment of her imagination.” (42) This practicality also 
      manifests itself in an attack on abstraction and “thinking taken as a single 
      course of action… an outrageously reductive definition.” (53) Appealing again 
      to that bedrock of knowledge that lies somewhere beneath the accretions of 
      society and culture, they ask: “Does anyone really believe that a person could 
      ever be figured out as such in the abstract?” (6) And again, “Questions about 
      the nature and purpose of our species cannot be answered through reflection 
      alone.” (xiv). The world is a “mass of chaos, this massive mix of order and 
      chaos… people are forced to abstract in order to proceed, but any abstracting 
      requires that not as much be taken into consideration as ought to be. A person 
      can never get to the bottom of her own alertness.” (52)</p>
    <p class="doublespace">Gins and Arakawa seek to restore 
      life to us, in its complexity and difference: “A ruling concern is that nothing 
      conceivably belonging in the picture… be left out of it. This emphasis on 
      an all-inclusiveness, an inclination to attend to everything, naturally leads 
      to more specificity, a searching out of exact placements of, and uses for, 
      the elements and features of architectural environments.” (xix) And simultaneously 
      to restore us to our liveliness which has been dissipated by our consciousness 
      of mortality, we live in a “crisis condition which gets routinely covered 
      up… Much of the liveliness on this planet registers numb… All intellectual 
      efforts thus far, in East and West alike, have been largely stopgap measures.” 
      (xxv)</p>
    <p class="doublespace">However, sensible as much of 
      this is, how practical is a plan to prolong life indefinitely? Might not the 
      preservation of individual life be in conflict with preservation of the species 
      and, of course, the planet? Equally, while one admires the offhand way in 
      which economic considerations are dismissed, how practical or feasible is 
      this? To pose a question that is both banal and yet relevant — where does 
      the money come from? The world’s defence budgets would be ideal as a beginning, 
      of course, but how do we reach the point where that becomes likely? Further, 
      when the need for money for food/health/education is so pressing, can we justify 
      spending “enormous amounts” on developing an architecture that may help some 
      humans resolve their (our) existential problems?</p>
    <p class="doublespace">And yet, what the writers propose 
      is quite different to spending money on, for example, the sort of medical 
      research whose benefits, at best, might eventually trickle down to the lower 
      strata of the world community. If the U.S., say, was to adopt this principle 
      — “[e]conomic priority should be given to the resolving of existential puzzles: 
      What is this species in the first place? What lives and what dies?” (xxi) 
      — it would surely benefit not only millions of Americans, but a multitude 
      of others, inspired anew by the resurgence of revolutionary America. In such 
      a world, food/health/education would be taken care of, people would be taken 
      care of, for can anyone doubt that the importance of this would at last be 
      fully and completely acknowledged?</p>
    <p class="doublespace">As I indicated at this beginning 
      of this piece, <i>Architectural Body</i> is a visionary and revolutionary 
      work. It inspires one to believe that much more is possible than we’ve allowed 
      for, that we can move beyond the small adjustments and consolations of our 
      current existence to a new Eden “where people work and play at figuring out 
      what in the world they could possibly be.” (62) In a spirit of attentiveness 
      and inclusiveness, and acknowledging, as religion and ideology rarely do, 
      our uncertainty and tentativeness, Gins and Arakawa announce the possibility 
      of transcendence: “If we overflow with a sentient tentativeness (read awareness), 
      then transcendence is here and now and can and should be constructively and 
      crisis-ethically reworked — the spiritual and the critical become one.” (81)</p>
    <p class="doublespace">I have quoted extensively from 
      <i>Architectural Body</i> because one of the great pleasures of this text 
      is the way language is used. Poem/treatise/dialogue/manifesto — <i>Architectural 
      Body</i> is all of these. As manifesto, it sounds a note that seems to have 
      been absent too long — “Let our species cease being stunned into silence and 
      passivity, into defeatism, by an architecture that seems so accomplished but 
      that leads nowhere.” (39) Rousing stuff and yet was ever a manifesto so good-humoured 
      as this, so satisfactory in its combination of idealism and practicality, 
      the profound and the obvious (which, being so, is frequently neglected). (I 
      note in passing, this is one manifesto with no hit list.) Read it, read it 
      again and, if you are in a position to supply the authors with the funding 
      they require, do it for all of us.</p>
