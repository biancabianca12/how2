        </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For a long time, to be modern was to not be Victorian. 
        And certainly, the image of Christina Rossetti, retiring and ailing Victorian 
        spinster penning verses about birds and goblins, fits the image of everything 
        modern poetry sets out to oppose. This image has powerful resonance; it 
        intervenes, looms large in any potential discussion about Rossetti as 
        participating—poetically speaking—in the practice and formulation of modern 
        poetics. Rossetti comes far too early, I have often been told, to be discussed 
        in the context of poetic modernism, although this objection is never raised 
        about Charles Baudelaire, her exact contemporary. It seems that Rossetti—“Christina,” 
        as both Woolf and Pound tend to call her—arrived at the wrong time <i>and</i> 
        the wrong place and, as Pound’s distinctly more venomous “Christina” reminds 
        us, in the wrong gender to be modern.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar have famously argued 
        that modernism, in particular, formalist and language-centered, experimental 
        literary modernism, was “constructed not just against the grain of Victorian 
        male precursors” but as part of “a complex response to <i>female </i>precursors 
        and contemporaries” and that reaction “against the rise of literary women 
        became not just a theme… but a motive for modernism.” <A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1">[1]</a> 
        Any reader familiar with the dizzyingly juvenile, quasi-pornographic misogyny 
        that characterizes the rhetoric of Eliot’s and Pound’s poetic collaboration 
        can hardly wonder at this estimation, as Pound disparages the “great passive 
        vulva of London” or mocks Eliot for having “cervic cysts” “honied by hellenists.” 
        <A HREF="#_edn2"NAME="_ednref2">[2]</a> Gilbert and Gubar implicate Pound’s 
        and Eliot’s “twin strategies of excavation and innovation” and “the linguistic 
        innovation associated with the avant-garde—they specify puns, allusions&#8221;, 
        and “arcane and fractured forms”—in a project of cultural elitism that 
        excludes women. Despite the “intermittent” participation of “a Gertrude 
        Stein and a Djuna Barnes,” they contend, formal innovation of this kind 
        is “a men’s club.” <A HREF="#_edn3"NAME="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But this critical logic <i>accepts </i>what it critiques 
        as the underlying premise of modernism: that a formalist poetics excludes 
        women. If this kind of modernist poetic formalism does indeed arise in 
        opposition to what it repeatedly characterizes as a “feminine” poetics 
        of “soft” “sentimentality” but <i>also</i> in opposition to the literary 
        success of actual women, it is convenient to conflate these poetic enemies 
        such that femininity, softness, and successful poetry by women take a 
        form that much resembles a Victorian spinster poetess. Her champions, 
        then, might well wish to repudiate the poetics that seems so to oppose 
        her. Yet the exclusion of a number of poems by Christina Rossetti from 
        a developing tradition of poetic modernism can occur only <i>in violation</i> 
        of this modernism’s own principles of poetic value, impersonality, and 
        formal innovation. On formal grounds alone, Rossetti’s volume <i>Goblin 
        Market</i> features poems driven by formal or material devices that will 
        later be claimed and coded as “modern”: puns, for example, as central 
        or driving textual elements (“May” turns on a month and a possibility 
        (or lack thereof), while “Spring” plays on compression at the formal level); 
        or the metrical collage of “arcane and fractured forms” that is the title 
        poem. If we take poetic modernism on its own terms and abstract the poetry 
        from its poet, then Rossetti’s poetry indeed does have something of “the 
        modern cadence” that Pound reluctantly attributes to her. I’m arguing 
        here, however, not on the evidence of the poems (as I have elsewhere) 
        but rather on the evidence of modernism’s reaction to Rossetti, as embodied 
        in essays by Virginia Woolf and Ezra Pound. For modern writers <i>and 
        </i>for generations of critics educated in their wake, it is difficult 
        to recognize the spinster as a poet; more than awkward, to embrace the 
        Victorian as the modern. Since Pound defined creative thought as being 
        “like the male cast of the human seed” and associated literary form with 
        masculine “hardness,” we can see why acknowledging Rossetti as a poetic 
        predecessor would pose problems. <A HREF="#_edn4"NAME="_ednref4">[4]</a> 
        For Woolf, a modern and a woman much concerned with her identity as both, 
        the acknowledgement is more urgent but no less troubled. Why these difficulties 
        remain so in force today is less clear; perhaps the intransigence of these 
        oppositions is best understood as a testament to the entrenched staying 
        power of a gendered poetics that the moderns only inherited, as did we. 
        Indeed, the following largely unadorned comparison of two modernist reactions 
        to Rossetti demonstrate the just how powerful and deforming a force this 
        gendered understanding of poetic innovation has been.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Ezra Pound: “The Hard and Soft in French Poetry” 
        (1918); “The Prose Tradition in Verse” (1914)</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Ezra Pound several times singles out elements of 
        Rossetti’s work as characterized by qualities he values, but does so almost 
        nervously, deflecting this positive evaluation or simply glancing off 
        it to deny its validity for reasons that remain uninvestigated. In discussing, 
        for example, the qualities of “hardness” and “softness” (he likes “hardness,” 
        of course) Pound evokes Rossetti: “[t]here is definite statement in George 
        Herbert, and likewise in Christina Rossetti, but I do not feel that they 
        have much part in this essay. I do not feel that their quality is really 
        the quality I am seeking here to define.” <A HREF="#_edn5"NAME="_ednref5">[5]</a> 
        Not surprisingly, Pound finds the woman poet not “hard” in the way he 
        is thinking, but he does not elaborate on how her “statement” differs 
        from the “hardness” he has in mind and immediately abandons any further 
        discussion of her poetry. Similarly, in a discussion of Ford Madox Ford, 
        Pound nearly writhes on the page in confronting “Mr. Hueffer’s” understanding 
        that poetry is “‘all Christina Rossetti’”: </p>
      <blockquote> As for Christina, Mr.Hueffer is a better critic than I am, 
        and I would be the last to deny that a certain limpidity and precision 
        are the ultimate qualities of style; yet I cannot accept his opinion. 
        Christina had these qualities, it is true—in places, but they are to be 
        found also in Browning and even in Swinburne at rare moments. Christina 
        very often sets my teeth on edge—but so, for that matter, does Mr. Hueffer. 
        But it is the function of criticism to find what a given work is, rather 
        than what it is not. It is also the faculty of a capital or of high civilization 
        to value a <i>man</i> for some rare ability, to make use of <i>him</i> 
        and not to hinder <i>him</i> or itself by asking of <i>him</i> faculties 
        which <i>he</i> does not possess. [emphasis added] 
        <p>Mr. Hueffer may have found certain properties of style first, for himself, 
          in Christina, but others have found them elsewhere, notably in Arnaut 
          Daniel and in Guido, and in Dante, where Christina herself would have 
          found them. Still there is no denying that there is less of the <i>ore 
          rotundo</i> in Christina’s work than in that of her contemporaries, 
          and that there is also in Hueffer’s writing a clear descent from such 
          passages as:</p>
        <p>I listened to their honest chat:</p> </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><br>
                   Said one: ‘To-morrow we shall be<br>
              Plod plod along the featureless sands<br>
                   And coasting miles and miles of sea’<br>
              Said one: ‘Before the turn of tide<br>
                   We will achieve the eyrie-seat.’<br>
              Said one: ‘To-morrow shall be like<br>
                   To-day, but much more sweet.’ </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p> We find the qualities of what some people are calling ‘the modern 
          cadence’ in this strophe, also in: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote> Sometimes I said: ‘It is an empty name<br>
                 I long for; to a name why should I give<br>
            The peace of all the days I have to live?’—<br>
                 Yet gave it all the same. <A HREF="#_edn6"NAME="_ednref6">[6]</a> 
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Pound does not discuss here, however, what “qualities” 
        of cadence <i>those</i> are nor how they are modern. Nor does he discuss 
        precisely what “man” is being asked for “faculties” that “he” does not 
        possess—since Pound just has acknowledged, however grudgingly, that “Christina” 
        has “the ultimate qualities of style.” In any case, the discussion ends 
        here. Pound’s near approaches, glancing blows, his simultaneous awareness 
        and denial of Rossetti’s relevance: these elements of the essay stage 
        a convincing performance of the internal struggle between prejudice and 
        poetic value, with the former winning only by quitting the game.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Virginia Woolf: “I am Christina Rossetti” (1930)</b></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Not surprisingly, Virginia Woolf approaches Christina 
        Rossetti from a markedly different standpoint. The quotation with which 
        she titles her essay “I am Christina Rossetti” looks much like a radical 
        claim of identification. Yet the essay begins by an evocation of biography, 
        of the “strangeness, amusement, and oddity of the past sealed within a 
        tank.” <A HREF="#_edn7"NAME="_ednref7">[7]</a> Woolf structures her essay 
        such that “Christina”—and she, like Pound, uses the familiar name for 
        much of the essay—emerges first as an odd Victorian character; next, as 
        “a little woman dressed in black” who announces her identity (as quoted 
        in the essay’s title) at a tea-party, and only then, finally, as a poet. 
        Woolf distances Rossetti from the modern by sealing her in the “tank” 
        of Victorian biography even as she proclaims her own self-identification 
        with “little woman” at the tea-party. The opening images of the essay, 
        even if cast here in an ironic light, underscore the tension between the 
        Victorian and the modern woman’s image of herself. To say “I am a poet,” 
        words Woolf ventriloquizes for Rossetti, and to say “I am Christina Rossetti” 
        (a Victorian woman) seems to suggest a conundrum with which Woolf is well 
        acquainted. How to put that past, that context, that identity, together 
        with these words? Woolf dwells on this problem of biography:</p>
      <blockquote> How absolute and unaccommodating these poets are! Poetry, they 
        say, has nothing to do with life. Mummies and wombats, Hallam Street and 
        omnibuses, James Collinson and Charles Cayley, sea mice and Mrs. Virtue 
        Tebbs, Torrington Square and Endsleigh Gardens, even the vagaries of religious 
        belief, are irrelevant, extraneous, superfluous, unreal. It is poetry 
        that matters. The only question of any interest is whether that poetry 
        is good or bad. But this question of poetry, one might point out if only 
        to gain time, is one of the greatest difficulty. <A HREF="#_edn8"NAME="_ednref8">[8]</a> 
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Who are these intractable poets of whom she speaks? 
        They seem at once associated with Christina Rossetti and with the more 
        modern school of pure poetics we would more likely associate with Woolf’s 
        own contemporaries. But is Woolf agreeing with them? Or suggesting that 
        Rossetti can best be understood in context, or that she cannot be removed 
        from the context in which she wrote? If she means, as she later speculates, 
        “[b]etter perhaps read for oneself, expose the mind bare to the poem, 
        and transcribe in all its haste and imperfection whatever may be the result 
        of the impact,” then why the relentless first pages of quaint Victorian 
        context?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Woolf then goes on to recapitulate many a Victorian 
        truism about not just Rossetti, but women’s poetry generally: “You were 
        an instinctive poet… Years and the traffic of the mind with men and books 
        did not affect you in the least… Your instinct was so sure, so direct, 
        so intense that it produced poems that sing like music in one’s ear…” 
        <A HREF="#_edn9"NAME="_ednref9">[9]</a>. Woolf’s admiration of and identification 
        with Rossetti is sincere; it is itself affecting. But just as we might 
        expect from an essay by one woman writer that announces its identity as 
        another woman writer (but in quotes), this essay betrays a tremendous 
        uncertainty about how to read a Victorian woman’s formalism: it must be 
        instinctive—but it seems it cannot be. Woolf claims that “[t]he judgement 
        of contemporaries is almost always wrong” but goes on to cite nineteenth-century 
        critical readings that resonate powerfully with the values espoused by 
        poetic modernism. One she draws from “Professor Saintsbury”:</p>
      <blockquote> The meter of the principal poem [‘Goblin Market’] may be best 
        described as a dedoggerelized Skeltonic, with the gathered music of the 
        various metrical progress since Spenser, utilized in the place of the 
        wooden rattling of the followers of Chaucer. There may be discerned in 
        it the same inclination towards line irregularity which has broken out, 
        at different times, in the Pindaric of the late seventeenth and earlier 
        eighteenth centuries, and in the rhymlessness of Sayers earlier and of 
        Mr Arnold later; </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The other from (a later) Sir Walter Raleigh: “I think 
        she is the best poet alive… The worst of it is you cannot lecture on really 
        pure poetry….” <A HREF="#_edn10"NAME="_ednref10">[10]</a> On the one hand, 
        we have the valorization of metrical collage, of what we might, with Gilbert 
        and Gubar, call “the twin strategies of excavation and innovation”; on 
        the other, an invocation of “pure poetry.” Yet Woolf eschews both of these 
        “Victorian” assessments that nonetheless seem much in keeping with modernist 
        poetic values for her own epithet “instinctive,” a ubiquitous Victorian 
        critical truism about women’s poetry. Ultimately, however, Woolf abandons 
        this rhetoric too, or rather moderates it—and all this in the second person, 
        addressed to the same “Christina Rossetti” the essay identifies itself 
        as somehow being:</p>
      <blockquote> …you were not a pure saint by any means. You pulled legs; you 
        tweaked noses. You were at war with all humbug and pretence. Modest as 
        you were, still you were drastic, sure of your gift, convinced of your 
        vision. A firm hand pruned your lines; a sharp ear tested their music. 
        <A HREF="#_edn11"NAME="_ednref11">[11]</a> </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Pointed, disruptive play is not the province of birdsong; 
        nor is editing, although the strangely disembodied “firm hand” that “prunes” 
        is nonetheless at some distance from the natural outgrowth of the song. 
        Finally, Woolf’s rhetoric (quietly) distances Rossetti’s poetic output 
        from yet another set of clichés that cluster around women’s poetry: “Nothing 
        soft, otiose, irrelevant cumbered your pages.” Poetry that was not “soft” 
        and yet, was by a woman: Woolf makes the same discovery that caused Pound 
        some little distress. “In a word,” as Woolf writes, accepting the equation 
        of “soft” and “irrelevant” and, implicitly, of “hardness” and “art,” “you 
        were an artist.” The next lines of the essay find Woolf herself struggling 
        to put this conundrum together: </p>
      <blockquote> And thus was kept open, even when you wrote idly, tinkling 
        bells for your own diversion, a pathway for the descent of that fiery 
        visitant who came now and then and fused your lines into that indissoluble 
        connexion which no hand can put asunder… Indeed so strange is the constitution 
        of things, and so great the miracle of poetry, that some of the poems 
        you wrote in your little back room will be found adhering in perfect symmetry 
        when the Albert Memorial is dust and tinsel. </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It seems that the “idly tinkling bells” of women’s 
        writing can be visited by the (genderless?) muse of poetry that can “fuse” 
        lines into “indissoluble” (not liquid, not wet) poetry, and that through 
        this miracle, even we moderns can understand a Victorian woman poet who 
        wrote lines that will “adhere” beyond the life of the most monumental 
        of Victorian shrines.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Woolf ends her essay with a speculation that, had 
        she been present for Rossetti’s declaration, she “should certainly have 
        committed some indiscretion… in the awkward ardour of my admiration.” 
        Woolf is aware of and confronts her own awkwardness as a modern writer 
        identifying with a Victorian poetess: she offers her own essay as awkward, 
        and if she has not worked out all the terms of that awkwardness, we can 
        nonetheless applaud her for offering it to posterity. But the extent of 
        this awkwardness should not be forgotten, for who more than Woolf would 
        be likely to embrace Rossetti as a sister, and not a maiden aunt? Yet 
        ultimately, she can not even give “Christina” complete credit for her 
        own poems: for how could “a little woman in black”; “tinkling” “a bell” 
        for “diversion” have written poems of “perfect symmetry”? Pound’s and 
        Woolf’s reactions to Rossetti offer a poignant reminder of the very great 
        extent to which reading, like writing, takes place within a strongly gendered 
        framework—and how difficult it may be to escape this framework, even with 
        the best intentions. Pound claimed modernism and form as masculine but 
        he also seems more than a little blinded by his own issues with sperm 
        (this is his joke, after all). Why should feminist critics continue to 
        accept his attitudes about women and poetic form at face value? Furthermore, 
        the questions Pound raises but does not pose—what makes Rossetti modern, 
        and what has prevented readers from seeing her as such—are key to a renewed 
        debate about reevaluating modernist poetics with relation to women writers. 
        In reading these essays, we see how this same gendered framework has both 
        denied and demonstrated Rossetti’s importance in the development and reception 
        of a modern poetics, and how it has done the same for its own intractable 
        influence, both then and now.</p>
