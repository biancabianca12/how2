        <p class="TITLE2" align="left"> <em>American Women Poets in the 21st Centuy: 
          Where Lyric Meets Language<br>
          </em>eds. Claudia Rankine and Juliana Spahr<br>
          Middletown, Connecticut: Wesleyan University Press, 2002<br>
          Paper (ISBN 0-8195-6547-4), 439 pages</p>
        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I like this volume.  It has my head whirring. Because 
          I am reading this volume, I am busily rethinking my “Experimental Women’s 
          Writing” seminar for fall.  Because I am reading this volume, I am reconsidering 
          the efficacy of other “poetry anthologies” (including my own co-edited 
          one) that lack the structural hybrid that <i>American Women Poets in the 
          21<sup>st</sup> Century</i> quite uniquely presents.   Because I am reading 
          this volume, I am reconsidering the efficacy, and the sheer beauty, of 
          lyric in the charge of women.  For the women represented in this anthology 
          are well versed in the lyric’s problems for women (pun intented).  They 
          are women bold enough to write lyric anyway.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Even if Theodor Adorno was right, that “to write 
          poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.” As co-editor Juliana Spahr notes 
          in her comprehensive introduction, Adorno’s phrase recently has come under 
          feminist challenge.  This volume lets us re-imagine the sense of the “barbaric.”  
          If the “barbaric” becomes a nominal signifier referencing an otherwise 
          indescribable space only superciliously tagged “the confessional,” so, 
          too, the lyric becomes an indescribable space that poets featured here 
          can inhabit.  The American women poets selected by Spahr and co-editor 
          Claudia Rankine seem all too aware of Adorno’s conclusion. A dialogue 
          between issues of “lyric, gender, and innovation,” Spahr promises us a 
          deeper exploration of the politically incorrect lyric, through snippets 
          of these poets’ work, along with their artist’s statements and excellent 
          critical analyses.  All the poets here — Spahr especially cites Lucy Brock-Broido, 
          Brenda Hillman, Jorie Graham, and Ann Lauterbach — seem to be rearticulating 
          the lyric’s “impossibility and difficulty,” working to construct a new 
          formation of lyrical’s “interiority,” as site of resistance.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perceiving “modernist innovation” as “a feminist 
          space,” after foremothers in the innovative field, Kathleen Fraser and 
          Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Spahr is careful to distinguish between a “poetry 
          of uplift” that might attempt to provide “positive images of revised femininity.”  
          These poets rather call for an investigation of “representation itself” 
          through the lyric, suggesting “alternatives to lyrics troubled and limited 
          history for women” (3).  The artists’ statements — what the volume editors 
          call “poetic statements” — help articulate that investigation, on all 
          its fronts.  The inclusion of these artists’ statements alone makes this 
          volume an invaluable resource, as well as an excellent textbook for any 
          advanced women’s writing or contemporary American poetry class.  Many 
          of the artists’ statements are reprinted from small-press poetry journals 
          like <i>Fence</i>.  But some are explicitly written for this volume, such 
          as Mei-mei Berssenbrugge’s “Preparatory Notes” and “By Correspondence,” 
          combining both self-reflective statements about the writing process along 
          with a series of “Letters” addressed to critic Linda Voris, which answer 
          central concerns about Berssenbrugge’s life and work. Anyone who loves 
          Berssenbrugge’s work will find her statement fascinating.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And I particularly admire Rae Armantrout’s statement, 
          the essay “Cheshire Poetics,” which with Armantrout’s usual elliptical 
          and humorous clarity constructs the metaphor of an appearing and disappearing 
          “Cheshire” to call forth what she suggests is “the double bind” of meaning 
          in her poetry: the problem of “what is seen and what is seeing, what can 
          be known and what it is to know.”  Like Ron Silliman, who has written 
          provocatively of his good friend Armantrout’s use of ellipses to create 
          an empirical-epistemological problematic of meaning, Armantrout proudly 
          places herself within a spatialized and sonic reference system in which 
          writing becomes not a means of saying something purposeful but “a poetics 
          of collisions and overlaps, of contested spaces”;  “Various voices speak 
          in my poems, I code-shift.”  Armantrout declares a loyalty to the “slither” 
          that Ezra Pound pronounced was happily missing in modernist poet HD’s 
          writing — a loyalty I would argue is shared by all the other poets in 
          the volume that follow.  While I don’t think Armantrout quite pegged Pound 
          to the wall — I believe he was critiquing the “slither” of Georgian sentimentality 
          in pre-war popular verse and advocating a “cut direct” method that embraced 
          rather than rejected Armantrout’s “slither” — it is her duality between 
          indirectness and oracular precision that compels the reader of her verse.  
          It is our desire for what Barbara Guest called “Fair Realism” (in her 
          1989 book by that title) vying against the “swerving motion” that typifies 
          referentiality in Armantrout’s poetry (quoting Hank Lazer’s fine essay 
          on the matter).  This effect leaves the reader longing for more, for more 
          “slither,” for more “contested spaces.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The inclusion of poets like Lucie Brock-Broido, Jorie 
          Graham, and Brenda Hillman, together with Guest, Lauterbach, Lyn Hejinian 
          and Armantrout, sets up the underlying aesthetic question of this volume, 
          once so beautifully articulated by Armantrout herself: What is the meaning 
          of clarity? And, again, borrowing from Armantrout: what does clarity <i>mean</i>, 
          to <i>whom</i>?  The notion of clarity, and the schools of lyric poetry 
          fighting for and against that expression, create a provocative subtext 
          in the knot of the weave of these distinctive female voices.  Brock-Broido’s 
          poem, “Periodic Table of Ethereal Elements,” seems among the more conventional 
          lines of lyric represented here, in sturdy stanzas such as:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p style="text-align:justify">I was not ready for your form to be cold.<br>
            Ever. Even in life</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">You did not inhabit, necessarily, a form,<br>
            But a mind of</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Rarer liquid element...  (96)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And yet Brock-Broido breaks the mold of the confessional 
          lyric herself in her fractured and ambiguous poem, “Am Moor,” in which 
          sentences seem missing essential components, like subjects or objects, 
          beginning:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p style="text-align:justify">Am lean against.<br>
            Am the heavy hour</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Hand at urge,<br>
            At the verge of one...  (98)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Brock-Broido’s provocative artist’s statement, “Myself 
          a Kangaroo Among the Beauties,” is a series of epigrammatic declarations, 
          which suggest her own lack of lyrical sentimentality when she writes: 
          “I want a poetry which is inorganic, an artifact of artifice, riddled 
          with truth” (100).  Meanwhile, she makes a stern critique of the judgement 
          she feels being not associated with the experimental LANGUAGE school.  
          She writes: “A poem which the world longs to call a language poem is too 
          open for my taste”; and, again, “After I had been the recipient of a particularly 
          thrashing review, Charles Wright, in a letter of solidarity &amp; sympathy, 
          wrote to me regarding LANGUAGE(?) poetry.  He wrote: “What have we been 
          doing all this time anyway, Barking?”  Rejecting the LANGUAGE label, Brock-Broido 
          states, “I aspire to be a New Elliptical.” (101) In his essay on Brock-Broido, 
          Stephen Burt writes of her “Sometimes desperate, often fanciful,” poems, 
          which  “elaborately diverse, allude, and evade.”  These poems, too, “slither.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In fact,<i> American Women Poets in the 21<sup>st</sup> 
          Century</i> helps to reframe the debate about experiment versus tradition 
          in women’s contemporary poetry.  It begs the question: Are you LANGUAGE 
          or not?  I mean it literally <i>begs</i> the question, by refusing to 
          answer it, by refusing to divide the poets into categories that seem exclusionary 
          by design: the outside innovative and the inside conventional, or the 
          inside innovative and the outside conventional — depending on what side 
          one is on. In Sara Lundquist’s wonderful essay on Barbara Guest, “Implacable 
          Poet, Purple Birds,” she describes Guest as bifurcating and blurring boundaries: 
          a poet of some kind of wonderful slither.  She says that Guest “both is 
          and is not a feminist writer…. she both practices and questions ‘experimental 
          poetics’: she both anticipated and surpasses the Language poets.” Such 
          a statement might be made of all the poets represented in this volume.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Instead of the sounds of women arguing, we detect 
          in this volume a more subtle atmosphere, a muted but steady chamber of 
          voices that intersect but never merge, voices that bounce off the various 
          walls of rhetoric others have constructed without colliding. It’s as if 
          there exists in this forum a huge spatial field for all forms of language 
          and imagination and innovation.  If anything, this volume reveals how 
          very distinctive <i>are</i> 21<sup>st</sup> century American women poets.  
          It reveals that women writers are not necessarily tethered to their gender, 
          as Virginia Woolf once suggested of the fictive writer Mary Carmichael 
          in <i>A Room of One’s Own</i>.  But then Mary Carmichael was a novelist, 
          not a lyric writer.  The substrata of intellectual and aesthetic content 
          in this volume makes me think that the multitude of female voices articulating 
          American poetry are not <i>shedding</i> womanhood like a false referential 
          skin; rather they are reworking the physical and cultural synapses of 
          being a woman in the male lyric tradition, through a language and lyrical 
          structure that would divide them and objectify them, like so many fetishized 
          muses.  These voices speak from the “slithery” undefinable world that 
          always characterized “the object.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My criticisms of the volume are negligible.  I might 
          make the criticism that the poets represented here are pretty high-profile.  
          Most are highly published (by such venues as Wesleyan, the volume’s own 
          publisher) and many hold prestigious university positions.  This volume 
          has the effect of recanonizing the nearly canonical in contemporary American 
          poetry.  It takes few risks with its material.  No one really off-beat 
          or marginal gets her say here. The volume might be said to have a proper 
          feel.  Which is not necessarily a defect.  This is an elegant collection 
          that many of us will want to use in our classrooms as well as our research.  
          Overall, I was unusually delighted by the depth of the essays I discovered 
          reading this volume. I did find myself in great disagreement with Craig 
          Dworkin’s assessment of Hejinian’s work as the art of structural “paranoia.” 
          Dworkin clarifies and de-pathologizes his use of the paranoia term, using 
          Naomi Schor’s Freudian explanation to describe a “textual madness.” But 
          I would argue that Hejinian’s writing never constructs “paranoia.”  It 
          is neither “mad” nor a closed system of signs that paranoia represents.  
          Hejinian’s own poetic statement included next to Dworkin’s essay argues 
          for an implicit “host/guest” relationship within poetry, a “xenia,” she 
          writes, which is “the occurrence of an existence which is also an event 
          of strangeness or foreignness.”  It is that experience of “foreignness” 
          that might make such writing seem “mad.”  But like Freud’s uncanny, it 
          is that “foreignness” that resides at home, existing always in an encounter 
          that is cultural life itself.  That life constitutes a continual openness 
          and rearrangement.  And it is this life-as-language that characterizes 
          Hejinian’s work, not the profound sense of isolation structured by the 
          paranoiac.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One of the more successful essays, in my opinion, 
          is Voris’s piece on Berssenbrugge’s unique work. Her detailed analysis 
          of Berssenbrugge’s masterpiece <i>Empathy</i> did much to explain that 
          which always remains mysterious about Berssenbrugge’s lyricism: what Voris 
          calls “a ‘sensitive empiricism’… [disrupting] narrative and the rhetorical 
          representation that simplify experience by insistently tracing the myriad 
          and minute ways in which the phenomenal world enters experience.” (68-69)  
          Berssenbrugge understands “empathy” as those “imaginative acts that create 
          space and with which space is apprehended.” (73) I found this assessment 
          of empathy enormously helpful to my reading of Berssenbrugge’s masterwork, 
          as well as my own thoughts on sympathy and empathy.  Having written on 
          sympathy as a historical construct enveloping the novel, a voyeuristic 
          act requiring a subject’s objectification of the other, I found respite 
          in Voris’ reading of Berssenbrugge’s reading of “empathy”: as a non-linear 
          and non-objectifying set of “formal coordinates, including external and 
          internal boundaries, the sense of limit or of expansiveness…” Many have 
          asked me what is the distinctiveness of empathy from sympathy, and I would 
          turn them to Berssenbrugge (and Voris’ essay) now. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What this volume calls for are more analyses of women’s 
          contemporary poetics, more published artists’ statements, more collections 
          of women’s contemporary innovative writing. We should expand beyond the 
          well-grooved arguments about the lyric, and move the topic of experiment 
          into experimental forms, like the prose poem and intergenre, poems that 
          are no longer clearly “lyric” anymore — for example, the work of Carla 
          Harryman, Bernadette Mayer, and Leslie Scalapino.  This volume gives me 
          thirst — it doesn’t quench.  Which is perhaps the best thing I can say 
          about it.  <i>American Women Poets in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century </i>gives 
          us the desire to desire more contemporary women’s poetry, to read more 
          and beyond what has been already concluded or said.</p>
