          Geraldine Monk<br>
          West House Books, 2001, 118pp.</P>
        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P>
  
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><em>Noctivagations</em> brings together most of Geraldine 
          Monk’s writing since <i>Interregnum</i> in 1994 and her selected poems, 
          <i>The Sway of Precious Demons</i> in 1992.  It is important to stress 
          totality of her work, which is sometimes overlooked in reviews, especially 
          as this partiality is often experienced by women writers. <A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1"> 
          [1] </A> &nbsp;Moreover, much of Monk’s work has appeared in small press 
          editions, which may be out of print or difficult to obtain. Any reading 
          of <i>Noctivagations</i> should, therefore, be carried out in the context 
          of the earlier writing, of which it is both development and reprise.  
          One example is her playful return to the work of the Spanish artist Goya 
          in <i>La Tormenta</i>, reminding us of one of her most influential early 
          sequences “La quinta del sordo” <A HREF="#_edn2"NAME="_ednref2">[2]:</a></p>
  </div>
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>We cannot believe<br>
      our very-eyes oh yes our<br>
      very-eyes we cannot believe<br>
      <i>Sopa Goyesca La Quinta<br>
      </i><i>creps del sordo<br>
      </i><i>vegetal in season</i></div>
  </blockquote>
  <div class=Section1> 
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If Goya is the menu, he is also the heart beat of the 
      poem, in the repeated sound of ‘chin’chin’, recalling his name for the bourgeois: 
      ‘chinchilla’.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Another significant aspect of <i>Noctivagations</i> 
            is the promotional blurb on the back: one quote is from an experimental 
            poetry magazine, <i>Object Permanence</i>: “Eerie, violent… an exhilarating 
            flux of human-animal-alien corporealities approximated in language”, 
            and the other is from the <i>Yorkshire Post</i>: “genuine word magic… 
            a wonderful poet: revelatory, intense, ever surprising”.  By choosing 
            these extremely diverse admirers of her work, Monk seems to be making 
            the statement that she wants her work to cast as wide a spell as possible: 
            for it to be enjoyed both by the avant-garde and by a much wider audience.  
            She wants to break out of the marginalisation of the experimental, not 
            into the mainstream of British poetry, who will continue to marginalise 
            her work, but directly to anyone who may hear or read her.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There are those in the avant-garde too who will regard 
      this as impossible, or who might declare with Keith Tuma that Monk’s must 
      be ‘expressive’ rather than ‘difficult’ poetry:</p>
  </div>
  <blockquote> And the first thing to be said about Monk’s poetry is that while 
    it does not use the ‘dominant modes’ of expression, neither is it difficult.  
    Playful, rhetorical, feminist, it can also be as ‘expressive’ as an insult. <A HREF="#_edn3"NAME="_ednref3">[3]</a> 
  </blockquote>
  <div class=Section1> 
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Yet Monk’s poetry is both expressive and difficult, in 
      the sense of experimental and abstract.  It is as expressive as a Goya:</p>
  </div>
        <blockquote> Le Goya: un écrasis de rouge, de bleu et de jaune, des virgules 
          de couleur blanche, des pâtés de tons vifs, plaqués, pêle-mêle, mastiqués 
          au couteau… C’est le vacarme le plus effréné qui ait jamais été jeté sur 
          une toile… <A HREF="#_edn4"NAME="_ednref4">[4]</a></p> </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The debate about women experimental poets and ‘expressive’ 
      modes of writing continues to raise its head.  Clair Wills defined it, in 
      a much-quoted essay, as a false polarisation of formal experimentation and 
      expressive elements, and also of the private and public spheres:</p>
  </div>
  <blockquote> Thus it is not that ‘expressive’ poetry naively falls back on a stable 
    individuality, and experimental work explores the radical absence of subjectivity.  
    Both are responses to the reconfiguring of the relationship between public and 
    private spheres which makes the ‘private’ lyric impossible, and in effect opens 
    it out towards rhetoric. <A HREF="#_edn5"NAME="_ednref5">[5]</a> </blockquote>
  <div class=Section1> 
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">She has also analysed how the ‘expressive’ female self 
      is still present in the work of experimental women poets.  It seems to me 
      that a lot of experimental male poetry is intensely expressive, or emotional, 
      but generally within a socialist framework.  As a result male reviewers can 
      appear more comfortable with Monk’s ghettoblaster sequences than with her 
      female self.  The problem with ‘expressiveness’ in female experimental poetry 
      often has more to do with feminism than any form of rhetoric.  </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">2</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Noctivagations</i> is divided into nine sections: 
      The Transparent Ones; Trilogy; Songings &amp; Strangerlings; Dream Drover; 
      Hidden Cities; Two Dramatics; Fluvium; Three Short Sorties; and Nine Little 
      Ones.  I wrote a brief review of <i>Dream Drover</i> when it was originally 
      published, and which appeared in <i>How2</i>, February 2000.  Of the nine 
      sections, I think that the most interesting development of the experimental 
      and the expressive can be found in ‘The Transparent Ones’ and ‘Two Dramatics’, 
      with its radio drama ‘Manufractured Moon’.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">‘The Transparent Ones’ was originally a performance work 
      called the ‘Metablethers of Getha’.  The change in title is a more accurate 
      description of these texts, as the first version could be applied to all of 
      Monk’s work.  “Metablethers” is a wonderful neologism which also appears in 
      ‘Fluvium’ — some of the most experimental work in <i>Noctivagations</i>.  
      It combines the old English/ Scots word ‘blether’ or blather, meaning to talk 
      loquacious nonsense, with the multi-purpose Greek prefix ‘meta’.  It combines 
      Monk’s use of sound and nonsense poetry with a very rooted use of dialect.   
      She is both in the locale, the dialect, and rising above it, transmuting and 
      experimenting with it.  The name Getha is evidently one of Monk’s pseudonyms, 
      and is used as such in the radio drama ‘Manufractured Moon’.  It begins with 
      the first two letters of her Christian name, but ends in something suggestive 
      of the East, and other spirits.  This is not invalid even if we realise that 
      Getha has a very specific meaning for computer users: Get Hardware Address.  
      One of the developments in Monk’s work has been her use of electronic technology 
      and terminology, for her own subversive purposes.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">‘The Transparent Ones’ are the poems written out of her 
      time as a writer in residence at a hospice for terminally ill people.  If 
      I like it so much, I think it is partly because Monk is often depicted as 
      a wild woman of experimental poetry, whereas these poems show her capacity 
      for a deep attachment to the people she works with, and her essential humanism. 
      Sean Bonney in the Salzberg Review wrote:</p>
  </div>
  <blockquote> Geraldine Monk is part of a quite easily identified unofficial tendency 
    in contemporary British poetry.  A wild streak… shared with comparable poets 
    like Bill Griffiths and Maggie O’Sullivan. <A HREF="#_edn6"NAME="_ednref6">[6]</a> </blockquote>
  <div class=Section1> 
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This is ‘wild-poetry’, to use Bonney’s phrase, and as 
      indeed the title <i>Noctivagations </i>suggests, but it is also profoundly 
      responsible and responsive poetry.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The first poem is “The Gathering”, which begins as if 
      with stage instructions, and the staccato phrasing also used to powerful effect 
      in prose poem sections such as ‘Hidden Cities’ and ‘Three Short Sorties’:</p>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
  (High noon.  Mid summer.  Terrace.  Round table.  
      High Peaks in the distance.  Round robin of low sleepless talk.  The Transparent 
      Ones.)
  </blockquote>
  
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The reference to ‘High Noon’ is a deliberate one, and 
      it is typical of Monk’s work that she introduces filmic, popular culture references.  
      These are both comic and serious.  The struggle with death at the hospice 
      is as intense as any Western gun battle.  It is also one of the ways in which 
      we attempt to talk about death. </p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">‘The Transparent Ones’ raises questions about life and 
      death which are unanswerable, but Monk plays in deadly seriousness with those 
      questions:</p>
    
  <blockquote>
    <p>your natter-flack<br>
      questions creating<br>
      ineffable Q systems &amp;<br>
      split infinities</p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Her irreverence towards established religion and Catholicism 
      is probably most clearly reflected by one of her subjects in “Keltic Twilight”, 
      who expresses his “apostasy” in vivid dialect, which Monk captures:  “t-poep-sa-nutter”.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There are almost unbearable descriptions and word play 
      on dying flesh, but she never allows the poem to acquire too much solemnity.  
      Nor does she hide the pain of the last agony, and the panic:</p>
    
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Skin Panics.<br>
      Even our words are ridd ~ ~ led.<br>
      Sense disappears at every touch.<br>
      (...)</p>
    <p>In the grip of rising panic<br>
      we watch the solitary leaf unfurl ~ ~<br>
      There are moments of relief<br>
      in every fiction</p>
    <p>(The Unspeakable Softness of Flesh)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here punctuation, specifically the tilde, is used to 
      express the breakage or concealment of words and sense, and then becomes visually 
      expressive of new growth.  We have also become familiar, perhaps unconsciously 
      so, with the tilde on our computer screen where it can be shorthand for a 
      hidden extended document title.  Finally there is probably also an echo of 
      the Spanish diacritical mark, used to represent the sound ‘ny’, where the 
      missing letter is ‘y’.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I particularly like “Across Your Dreams in Pale Battalions 
      Go”,  <A HREF="#_edn7"NAME="_ednref7">[7] </a>in which Monk reworks the myth of Persephone, and features another 
      strong female subject.  It includes one of the technical devices she uses 
      frequently in ‘The Transparent Ones’, but also occurs elsewhere in her writing.  
      There are lines or verses in italics at the left hand margin, and then a verse 
      which is inset in ordinary type.  Sometimes the lines in italics seem to act 
      as commentary on the central verse, but at other times they act more as a 
      dialogue or antiphon.  As the woman (M) reads the “childs/ Persephone”, the 
      language of the poem becomes simultaneously child-like and Miltonic in its 
      desolation.  These are lines written from Eve and Persephone’s perspective:</p>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The female subject, Getha, in ‘Manufractured Moon’, is 
      the poet’s persona, with all her various attributes, some of which I referred 
      to earlier. ‘Manufractured Moon’ is a drama for radio written in the style 
      of a series of emails from Getha to some other person, an unknown friend.  
      I like the urgent, present tense nervy email style, which plays with, amongst 
      other things, the, often violent, urban and rural aspects of her locale late 
      at night.  The first email subject is “Fox barks”, and must also make a sly 
      reference to the Ted Hughes poem:</p>
    
  <blockquote>
    Sat upright and owl-eyed 
      for hours so thoughts got to pellets &amp; droppings of words but to longhand 
      e-mail or fax foxes…</p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">‘Manufractured Moon’ is also the most overtly feminist 
      of the texts in <i>Noctivagations</i>,  <A HREF="#_edn8"NAME="_ednref8">[8]</a> This is manifest in a partial retelling 
      of a child’s street or playground game about wanting to “cross the golden 
      river”.  The children have to ask the “farmer’s” permission, and in Monk’s 
      version the farmer (father) becomes a sinister figure: “Farmer Dark-Force 
      may we par take our father’s boiled dinner as it is in heaven?”  The female 
      self is also evident in her dig at organised religion.  She describes a ‘Last 
      Supper of 2000’ hanging in her room, which shows Christ with a “heart shaped 
      cob” and all the male apostles.  Later she becomes convinced that one of the 
      apostles isn’t male at all, transforms him into Joan of Arc, and finally (he) 
      sashays around like Gilda, a star of the silver screen.  Monk makes her own 
      divinity in “Falling Outs”:</p>
    
  <blockquote>
    The blind even quivered 
      as the iddy girl tungsten thin and burning bright fell out with all gods in 
      a big way such as only youngage can with starry id.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There is real menace in this urban night, particularly 
      in the figure of a threatening male stranger “flickering under the leaning 
      street-lamp”.  There is fear and horror, and an edge of madness in the penultimate 
      email: “Walls grin wetly.  And HE’s there again….”, and she signs off, or 
      trails off, as Get…. In the final email, however, he has been returned to 
      the lower case, and she is simply G. again, “Back on Track”.</p>
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Alison Croggon recently gave a very interesting paper 
      on the writings of women mystics in mediaeval England, direct antecedents 
      (if we need any) of Geraldine Monk.  She writes:</p>
    
  <blockquote>
    <p>…these texts suggest intriguing ways of looking at contemporary practices.  
      They are most subversive in how they assert their rational basis within contemporary 
      orthodoxies, which permits them to clear a space for a largely unheard female 
      vocabulary which then becomes its own authority.  Mere emotion is not enough; 
      mere intellectuality would not satisfy their desires nor permit a language 
      for female expressiveness.  <A HREF="#_edn9"NAME="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
