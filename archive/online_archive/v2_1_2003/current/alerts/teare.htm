      <p class="TITLE2" align="left"> Review of<em> We Who Love to Be Astonished: 
        <br>
        Experiemental Women's Writing and Performance Poetics<br>
        </em>Eds Laura Hinton and Cynthia Hogue<br>
        Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2002<br>
       Paper $24.95 (ISBN 0-8173-1095-9), 308 pages<br>
      </p>
     <p class="doublespace">There are an introduction, 
    eighteen essays, and one poem in Hinton and Hogue’s critical anthology, <i>We 
    Who Love to Be Astonished</i>, and these facts seem ordinary enough. Yet this 
    anthology presents us with the insistent awareness that there’s a substantive 
    difference between the tenor of this venture and those of other critical projects 
    surrounding contemporary experimental poetry. Though there are, no doubt, 
    many more reasons for this difference than those I suggest here, perhaps the 
    essential ones are these: while containing eminently readable critical prose, 
    politically engaged arguments and aesthetically erudite close-readings concerning 
    a <i>truly </i>wide range of women writers of experimental texts, the essays 
    in this volume also undertake to “reject rejoice rejuvenate,” as Stein writes 
    in “Patriarchal Poetry.” <A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1">[1]</a> They reject a tradition of criticism that doesn’t 
    account for <i>both</i> textual and social<i> </i>practices, rejoice in a 
    wide variety of women’s experimental writing, and rejuvenate the ethics of 
    a feminist critical tradition.</p>
  <p class="doublespace">To do this is to subtly 
    but significantly reframe current critical discourse about experimental writing 
    in general. In recognizing a greater number of political contexts in which 
    experimental poetry is written (especially those of gender, postcoloniality 
    and race—though not, alas, sexuality), and by expanding our notions of what 
    such writing might look and sound like, both on the page and in performance, 
    the essays in Hinton and Hogue’s anthology enlarge the notion of what it means 
    to encounter the work of others, and “create… a ‘space of appearance,’” <A HREF="#_edn2"NAME="_ednref2">[2]</a> 
    as Lyn Hejinian writes elsewhere, a place where “aesthetic discovery occurs 
    through encounters, at points of contact, and so [do] political and ethical 
    discovery.” <A HREF="#_edn3"NAME="_ednref3">[3]</a> <i>We Who Love to Be Astonished </i>creates these encounters 
    by questioning, as Kathleen Crown writes concerning the work of Tracie Morris, 
    “whether and how poetic ‘voice’ might be detached from its baggage of transparency, 
    presence, authenticity, and identitarian claims to representativeness <i>without</i> 
    losing its ability to invoke communal participation and meaningful political 
    response.” <A HREF="#_edn4"NAME="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
  <p class="doublespace">Though some strains of 
    this project can be seen at work in the excellent 1990 critical anthology 
    <i>The Politics of Poetic Form</i>, <A HREF="#_edn5"NAME="_ednref5">[5]</a><i> </i>that volume differs from <i>We 
    Who Love to Be Astonished</i> in consisting of critical writing by, and discussions 
    with, the poets themselves, many of whom are <i>already</i> part of the same 
    “avant-garde” writing community. In fostering newfound and surprising contiguities 
    among and between critics and the work of women experimental writers, the 
    clarity and resourcefulness with which the essays in <i>We Who Love to Be 
    Astonished </i>carry this off is as<i> </i>unusual as the project itself. 
    Additionally, it has been a decades-old trope of critics of what’s known variously 
    as postmodern, experimental or avant-garde writing to insist that politics 
    is communicated only by<i> </i>the way a text is organized and how it engages 
    language. Following post-structuralist thought they imply that, though a text 
    may take place within a politics, we as readers mustn’t take seriously the 
    validity of identity-based notions of community, or the politics that both 
    define and arise from these communities: to do so would mean being duped by 
    naïve “narratives.” For these reasons, though critics concerned specifically 
    with the “avant-garde” often engage the political content the text generates 
    through its use of artifice (its <i>conceptual</i> politics), they often either 
    make little of the political <i>context</i> in which the works were written 
    (its <i>contextual</i> politics), or choose to discuss writers whose political 
    context can be taken for granted (as in white and/or male and/or straight 
    and/or middle-class).</p>
  <p class="doublespace">In shifting critical debate 
    away from the “avant-garde” in particular and toward the many practices of 
    experimental writing by women, Hinton and Hogue and the essayists in the anthology 
    have produced a critical discourse in which political and social contexts 
    are determining factors in what Erica Hunt terms “oppositional poetics.” <A HREF="#_edn6"NAME="_ednref6">[6]</a> 
    This is possible, I would argue, because the epithet “avant-garde,” which 
    is so often used in current critical discourse to connote both style and aesthetic 
    market value, has long been the crux to such a problem. Ironically, its vagueness 
    as a marker of value and/or substance has gone as universally unremarked upon 
    as its meaning has been taken for granted. In his essay on the work of Harjo 
    and Waldrop collected in <i>We Who Love to Be Astonished</i>, Jonathan Monroe 
    interrogates both the vagueness of such a critical term and its relationship 
    to social practice: “What characteristic stances toward audience do such approaches 
    imply and what formal strategies do they deploy? What connections can we establish 
    between such strategies and the demands, desires, and needs of particular 
    communities?” <A HREF="#_edn7"NAME="_ednref7">[7]</a> </p>
  <p class="doublespace">By way of answer I would 
    submit that, in the very fabric of its history and usage, the phrase “avant-garde” 
    holds uninterrogated and inherently patriarchal thought-structures that persist 
    into our current critical discourse and create significant blind spots in 
    discussing experimental poetics. Further, its very vagueness protects its 
    status as a critical sign that posits and polices both aesthetic boundaries 
    and cultural value. Without interrogation, it continues to put into effect 
    an exclusionary system of cultural and social hierarchies antithetical to 
    the social practices of many feminist texts. As Renate Poggioli writes in 
    <i>The Theory of the Avant-Garde</i>, the phrase avant-garde first originated 
    in mid-nineteenth century France as a leftist political term that only later 
    gained somewhat pejorative literary and artistic connotations. <A HREF="#_edn8"NAME="_ednref8">[8]</a> Toward 
    the end of the nineteenth century, its political and artistic connotations 
    clearly parted ways, and the notion of a literary avant-garde divorced from 
    a culturally and historically specific leftist politics “passed over the frontiers 
    as ‘exchange currency’ into the international market of ideas,” <A HREF="#_edn9"NAME="_ednref9">[9]</a> where 
    the term both represents and circumscribes an ideology and “therefore is always 
    a social phenomenon.” <A HREF="#_edn10"NAME="_ednref10">[10]</a> </p>
      <p class="doublespace">Poggioli posits that the term avant-garde is nothing 
        <i>without </i>social context; hence critics of the avant-garde are quick 
        to provide one. In this effort, their favorite scarecrow is “Official 
        Verse Culture,” as represented by the work of Anthony Hecht or Edward 
        Hirsch. <A HREF="#_edn11"NAME="_ednref11">[11]</a> But the real problem 
        is three-fold: that this is cultural context, not social context (though 
        in this case what’s cultural is read to imply what’s social); that this 
        is the easiest possible critique for an intellectually sophisticated critic 
        to make against a tradition that values affect over intellect; and that 
        aiming critique outward, toward the aesthetic limitations of other poetics, 
        ensures that the term avant-garde as used in discourse often barely touches 
        upon its own limitations, the very real and specific social and political 
        contexts from which arise the avant-garde’s own particular ideology. </p>
  <p class="doublespace">As Jonathan Monroe writes, 
    the astonishing variety of women’s experimental writing has the potential 
    “to explore the generative possibilities” between cultures and “to move between 
    and among, if not within, to transform communities,” which is “a prospect 
    as unsettling and haunted as it is ecstatic.” <A HREF="#_edn12"NAME="_ednref12">[12]</a> However, rather than aiding 
    such writing in the transformation of community by including a wider range 
    of writing practices and writers in their criticism, critics of the avant-garde 
    insist instead on maintaining the already secured boundaries of avant-gardism, 
    flogging the already chastened horse of “O.V.C.,” and thereby insisting that 
    <i>this </i>is the only context against which the work should be read. Thus 
    we see how what’s “avant-garde” often passes into the marketplace of ideas 
    marked by an always already self-defined social context, its very identity 
    “an argument or self-assertion or self-defense used by a society in the strict 
    sense against society in the larger sense.” <A HREF="#_edn13"NAME="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
  <p class="doublespace">We can also see that when 
    criticism takes from the (usually self-elected) avant-garde its own parameters 
    and values (as Marjorie Perloff borrows from Charles Bernstein both the term 
    “official verse culture” and his rhetoric against it), the avant-garde is 
    thus further reified; and the term remains a closed set, a definition as policing 
    as it is policed, one that allows no entry to “others,” cultural, social or 
    otherwise. <A HREF="#_edn14"NAME="_ednref14">[14]</a> Such critical boundaries both enact hierarchy and define value 
    in a way that mimics patriarchal discourse and logic, or as Stein writes of 
    “Patriarchal Poetry,” it “makes no mistake in estimating the value to be placed 
    upon the best and most arranged of considerations… and as cautiously considered 
    as in allowance which is one at a time.” <A HREF="#_edn15"NAME="_ednref15">[15]</a></p>
  <p class="doublespace">I would suggest that in 
    taking its cues from Erica Hunt’s essay “Notes for an Oppositional Poetics,” 
    the editing of Hinton and Hogue reframes the aim of criticism of experimental 
    poetics, avoiding the reification that results from privileging an already 
    circumscribed group of poets—the “avant-garde”—and instead promoting what 
    Erica Hunt terms “contiguities.” <A HREF="#_edn16"NAME="_ednref16">[16]</a> Hunt’s oppositional poetics is a critical 
    practice that, as Hinton and Hogue write, consists of “finding or building 
    the interconnections among the various audiences of oppositional writers” 
    (what Hunt terms “contiguities”), and whose main advantage is that it is both 
    “a textual and social practice.” <A HREF="#_edn17"NAME="_ednref17">[17]</a> I would further argue two points: one, 
    that this is a particularly feminist ethics of criticism, which draws the 
    first-wave aim of changing the <i>structures </i>of patriarchal thought into 
    a second-wave theoretical framework without losing sight of hope for actual 
    political efficacy; and two, it is an ethics that has been sorely lacking 
    in the work of many critics of “avant-garde” texts. </p>
  <p class="doublespace">The essays in <i>We Who 
    Love to Be Astonished</i> establish their elaborate social/textual network 
    of contiguities in two ways. First, they consider the experimental writing 
    of a diverse range of women writers of color—Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Denise 
    Chávez, Harryette Mullen, Joy Harjo, Erica Hunt, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Tracie 
    Morris, and Jayne Cortez—alongside that of white women writers such as Susan 
    Howe, Fanny Howe, Rae Armantrout, Lyn Hejinian and Rosmarie Waldrop, among 
    many others. Second, they also explore writing whose genre blurs arise from 
    the boundaries between social and textual practice, such as Cha’s multimedia 
    <i>Dictée</i>, Morris’s performance (or “slam”) poetry, Cortez’s jazz performances, 
    Waldrop’s postcolonial and feminist interrogation <i>A Key into the Language 
    of America</i>, Notley’s feminist epic <i>The Descent of Alette</i>,<i> </i>Harjo’s 
    hybrid prose-poem/Native oral history <i>The Woman Who Fell from the Sky</i>, 
    and Hunt’s textual collaboration with visual artist Alison Saar, <i>Arcade</i>.</p>
  <p class="doublespace">The anthology’s organization 
    underscores the task at hand. Its chapters move from “Formal Thresholds,” 
    a relatively de-politicized chapter in which the work of Fraser, Armantrout, 
    Notley and Berssenbrugge is discussed mostly on an aesthetic level, to “Performative 
    Bodies,” a chapter that considers the highly politicized writing and performances 
    of Cha, Morris and Cortez alongside those of Acker and Waldman. Between these 
    two poles lie “In the Margins of Form” and “The Visual Referent/Visual Page,” 
    chapters notable for juxtaposing radically differing contents and contexts. 
    For example, an essay in “The Margins of Form” considers books by Harjo and 
    Waldrop that explore Native American postcoloniality through radically different 
    textual strategies; the essay creates a specifically charged instance of contiguities 
    built between writing with similar political content but radically different 
    aesthetics and political contexts. In “The Visual Referent/Visual page,” another 
    particularly fruitful contiguity is made through the juxtaposition of two 
    essays, each one discussing a differently racialized textual resistance to 
    history. The first analyzes Susan Howe’s use of the page, with its radical 
    re-visioning of the visual/textual history of white America in letters, while 
    the second reads the textual/visual collaboration of Hunt and Saar, <i>Arcade</i>,<i> 
    </i>a project that embodies the “oppositional poetics” of two African-American 
    women artists. And though these essays stand out as stunning examples of work 
    that create surprising social/textual contiguities within their own pages, 
    there are also excellent essays on Harryette Mullen, Lauterbach and Cole, 
    and Fanny Howe and Hejinian, that taken together enact the same project.</p>
  <p class="doublespace">Further, the anthology is organized in a way that does not 
    enforce or police aesthetic categories such as schools or movements. Rather, 
    within its loosely defined chapters, affinities are made across previously 
    well-policed boundaries. Here, poets who would elsewhere be discussed separately 
    as descendents of the New York School, or as Language poets, and poets who 
    wouldn’t be discussed at all (not belonging to any “avant-garde”), meet instead 
    on their own terms: those of their texts. Such juxtapositions both create 
    the social/textual contiguities of Hunt’s “oppositional poetics” and serve 
    as models for reading texts and bodies “raced and gendered in the eye of the 
    western world,” as Linda A. Kinnahan so poignantly writes, <A HREF="#_edn18"NAME="_ednref18">[18]</a> encouraging 
    the reader to do so in her own reading and critical practice.</p>
  <p class="doublespace">Triumphantly, <i>We Who 
    Love to Be Astonished </i>finishes with an ecstatic “Afterword” by Rachel 
    Blau DuPlessis, “Draft 48: Being Astonished,” a section from her ongoing long-poem 
    <i>Drafts</i>, whose early sections were recently collected in her 2001 Wesleyan 
    volume <i>Drafts 1-38: Toll</i>. Composed very much in the spirit of Stein’s 
    dictum “Reject rejoice rejuvenate,” DuPlessis’s poem is at once a polemical 
    record of the critical and experiential conflicts facing the woman writer, 
    an ecstatic and sensual riff of sonic silliness and associative eye- and ear-rhymes, 
    and a call to innovative action, to “Exfoliate rupture genderation by genderation,” 
    to “Get secular, get mixed, get everything you know / and what you don’t know, 
    down, and don’t shun nothing neither: allow.” <A HREF="#_edn19"NAME="_ednref19">[19]</a> In invoking the reader 
    so often and asking her to participate in “Rearrang[ing] arrangement,” <A HREF="#_edn20"NAME="_ednref20">[20]</a> 
    DuPlessis, too, creates textual and social contiguities, builds “of the human 
    confrontation with space / its politics, alphabets / longings and losses… 
    the deep flung crevasses / of…female-historical shapes / that embody the imprint 
    of intricate substance.” <A HREF="#_edn21"NAME="_ednref21">[21]</a></p>
      <p class="doublespace">Taken together, the essays collected in <i>We Who Love 
        to Be Astonished</i> and DuPlessis’s “Afterword” rejoice as palpably as 
        Stein’s wild hybridity, and rejuvenate a feminist ethics by enacting a 
        criticism of aesthetic depth and political engagement that, because of 
        its challenge to patriarchal thought and conventions, contains all the 
        etymological implications of the word “astonish” as outlined by Hinton 
        and Hogue in their introduction. Like the writing that inspired the critics 
        of <i>We Who Love to Be Astonished</i>,<i> </i>DuPlessis’s extended riffs 
        and passionate polemic take aim at criticism and history and, with erudition 
        and accuracy, sublimely stun as well as stupefy, shock and bewilder the 
        tradition that would hamper it. Coming as it does at the end of <i>We 
        Who Love to Be Astonished</i>, one feels the total power of the anthology’s 
        hard-won contiguities behind her lines as the poem rejects: “It’s deposition 
        time,” it warns, “Take down the full ghost”; <A HREF="#_edn22"NAME="_ednref22">[22]</a> 
        as it rejoices—“I want the much-maligned slither / bopping hither,” it 
        claims, “a writing whose condition is lubricated over writing / resisting 
        poetry, the whole contestable site”; <A HREF="#_edn23"NAME="_ednref23">[23]</a> 
        and, when asked “so what’s the point,” as it rejuvenates: “I can’t show 
        you anything,” it says, “except a vast history of radiant practices.” 
        <A HREF="#_edn24"NAME="_ednref24">[24]</a> Which is exactly what <i>We 
        Who Love to Be Astonished</i> reveals to us.</p>
