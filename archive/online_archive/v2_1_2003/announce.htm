<P CLASS="REDHEADER">HOW TO SUBMIT WRITING TO HOW2</P>

      <P>Sending Submissions by Email: Essays, &quot;readings,&quot; scholarly 
        studies or pieces of &quot;new writing&quot; (poetry or mixed genre forms) 
        should be submitted directly to the editor of that particular section. 
        Make sure you identify -- in the subject or the message -- which section 
        of HOW2 the writing is being directed at (e.g.: new writing, readings, 
        conferences, forums, etc.). </P>
      <p><strong>Text:</strong> is best sent as RTF (Rich Text Format) or a Microsoft 
        Word document (Microsoft Word 98 or 2000) as an attachment to an e-mail 
        (not within the e-mail). Most word processors can save a file as RTF text. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>File Title: </strong>Please write the title of each file so that 
        your surname starts the filename, eg. Faganpoem1.doc. Remember also to 
        attach the appropriate suffix (eg. &quot;.rtf&quot; or &quot;.doc&quot;) 
        to the filenames if you are using a Mac.</p>
      <p><strong>Font:</strong> The standard font for all texts in How2 is Georgia 
        or Times New Roman. </p>
      <p><strong>Layout: </strong>In most cases, we produces poems in single space, 
        and prose pieces in double space. If your piece requires a different sort 
        of line spacing, please indicate this and we will try to accommodate you. 
      </p>
      <p>Please use tabs rather than the spacebar when formatting poems. Arrangements 
        using the spacebar are lost when converted to HTML. </p>
      <p><strong>Graphics: </strong>These are best sent as e-mail attachments 
        in the forms of JPEGs. Please add the suffix &quot;.jpg&quot; (not &quot;.jpeg&quot;) 
        in lower case to the file name. If you are are scanning the artwork yourself, 
        please scan it at 100% size, with the resolution set to 300, 150 or 72 
        DPI. </p>
      <p>All manuscripts should include a short bio/biblio note with recent information 
        and publications. In addition, a Working Note must accompany all &quot;new 
        writing&quot; contributions. (See current new writing section for examples). 
        <br>

<P CLASS="REDHEADER">GUIDELINES</P>

<P>Proposals for original artwork should bear in mind the requirements of this journal. A xerox or photograph of suggested graphics should be sent to the editors, rather than original art work. If a piece of work is requested by an editor for a particular issue, the artist will then be asked to send the original art work to a designated postal address.</P>
