 <P><strong>&quot;Michael Field&quot; and Their World <br>
     <br>
An Educational Weekend at the University of Delaware <br>
27-29 February 2004 <br>
<br>
  </strong><br>
This event will be the first devoted to the lives and literary achievements of the British poets and playwrights Katherine Bradley (1846-1914) and Edith Cooper (1862-1913), the lesbian couple who wrote under the pseudonym of &quot;Michael Field.&quot; This weekend will also explore the late-Victorian cultural milieu surrounding them, focusing upon the artists (including the Pre-Raphaelites) who influenced them; the famous friends (such as Oscar Wilde, Walter Pater, John Ruskin, Robert Browning, &quot;Vernon Lee,&quot; George Meredith, Bernard Berenson, and Charles Ricketts) who formed their circle; and the avant-garde publishers and designers who produced their books. Already the subject of recent scholarship, the &quot;Fields&quot; are the center of a transatlantic revival of interest, studied for their approaches to feminism, aestheticism, female sexuality, collaborative creativity, spirituality, and journal writing. In keeping with their interdisciplinary cultural vision, the weekend will include a visit to the Delaware Art Museum , home of one of the largest and finest collections of Pre-Raphaelite art. <br>

        NOSTALGIA IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY BRITISH POETRY </strong><br>

      <p>It might seem paradoxical to consider the century of the Modernist avant-garde 
        from the point of view of nostalgia. However, nostalgia manifests itself 
        in twentieth-century British poetry in a multitude of ways. A selection 
        of papers (in English) will be published in ETUDES BRITANNIQUES CONTEMPORAINES 
        after the conference. </p>
      <p>Proposals in English (200 words for a 25 minute paper) to be sent to 
        Professor Paul Volsik (at:- <a href="mailto:volsik@paris7.jussieu.fr">volsik@paris7.jussieu.fr</a>) 
        before the end of MARCH 2003. Decision on acceptance by the scientific 
        committee (SEAC) before Easter 2003. </p>
