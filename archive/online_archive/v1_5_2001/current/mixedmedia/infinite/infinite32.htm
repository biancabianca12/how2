Rarely is there a single image. Bottles of prescription drugs, a woman,   a hospital building, trees, all merging but somewhat distinct on the screen.   Frames are superimposed once, twice, three times. Images from movies are shot   off the television so that a vertical roll prohibits a clear reading. Images   of writing, writing we can only glimpse at, pervade the film. <i>Here is a language.   I am mute</i>.<a href="footnotes.htm" target="_blank"><font size="2">38</font></a>   Letters make patterns, words are written in shadows, a splice mark in the middle   of a frame is a form of punctuation. Water drops blurring the marks of a felt   tip pen are played in reverse and for a moment one imagines that one will be   able to read the words being unveiled. A new language is being formed. One that   merges, without privilege, text, sound, and image - a language of duration-an   essay which is forty minutes long. Each shot is describable in itself, but the   language formed is one of connections and of experience.<i> She cannot occupy   her body through her senses, the only way which interests her - her reality   - the basis of every other reality - life itself. Yet life continues.</i><a href="footnotes.htm" target="_blank"><font size="2">39</font></a><i>   </i>The film gives an experience to the viewer, not by relating it, but by making   it. </p><p align="center"><img src="senses.jpg" width="288" height="138"></p><p align="center"><i>What I conceive is writing as an actual creation.

The difference only in the rhythm, speed, and pressure   with which each individual typist strikes the keys. The page is a map and through   visual markings a reader can hear her own audio track. Not only the sounds of   the words but the sounds of the image of the words. Italics are unanchored,   floating, possibly the sound of a light rain. Plain text is the typewriter striking   the paper in even tempo. The bold text adds an echo; resonating with its own   imprint. </p><p align="left"><i>And many of us who have no habit of reading not alone with   the eye but also with the ear, have-- especially at a superficial first reading--overlooked   the beauty of it. </i><a href="footnotes.htm" target="_blank"><font size="2">41</font></a></p><blockquote>  <blockquote>    <div align="right"><a href="infinite33.htm"><img src="blarrow.gif" width="28" height="28" border="0"></a></div>  </blockquote></blockquote></body></html>
