<body bgcolor="#FF9999" onLoad="MM_timelinePlay('Timeline1')">
<p><font color="#FFFFCC">When she was in Mexico she swam with a drowned man. It 
  was a small sea town and her friend didn't like it because the water did not 
  move. But they had already paid for the hotel. The heat rose off the sea but 
  it was not turquoise like the other coast. They went in the water and she was 
  afraid because she could not see all the way down. Her friend was from Manhattan 
  and laughed at her. Out of the corner of her eye she could see a body. She asked 
  her friend if she thought he was all right. Maybe he is meditating, said her 
  friend. They did not want to interrupt with their foreign unknowingness. But 
  she kept watching and she said to her friend, I haven't seen him take a breath. 
  Perhaps it is some Zen floating technique, said her friend, but I am from New 
  York and I don't want to get involved. She herself slowly swam closer to the 
  body. She was afraid because she knew he was dead and she was afraid of the 
  heaviness of a dead body. And when she was close, she saw it was true that the 
  body was heavy with it's own death, and so she turned to the beach and she yelled 
  to a man, &quot;un hombre muerte, un hombre muerte.&quot; He swam out to the 
  body and dragged it to the shore by the hair. It stayed there for five hours, 
  surrounded by onlookers, until an ambulance came. She shot super 8 footage of 
  this scene, footage which she has never looked at. An hour after the dead man 
  was dragged to the shore two men offered them a half price boat ride to see 
  the flamingoes. She and her friend laughed and asked if this was the dead man 
  special. The flamingoes were spectacular and she has looked at this footage.</font></p>
