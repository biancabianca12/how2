<p><i>The Four Museums are the Four Mirrors</i>.<font size="2"><a href="footnotes.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#FFFFFF">12</font></a></font> 
  In the film <i>Four Corners</i> there are four paintings reflecting at each 
  other. Four Paintings structuring an eighty minute film. Four paintings make 
  four corners make a room. And in-between, landscape. It has been three weeks 
  or so since viewing the film. Detail is becoming less distinct. <i>There is 
  no end of detail that is without significance</i>.<a href="footnotes.htm" target="_blank"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">13</font></a> 
  The first painting is a Cezanne landscape; the second an African American man 
  by a painter named Moses; the third a wall painting at four corners. The voice-over 
  says the artist who painted the wall was a woman, it states this as a fact, 
  yet the painting is from a time when history was not recorded with names. The 
  fourth painting, the final corner, is a flag painting by Jasper Johns. <i>These 
  inaccessible surfaces deny any definite meaning in the most definite way.</i><font size="2"><a href="footnotes.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#FFFFFF">14</font></a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
  </font>The camera, always static, photographs landscape from the southwest, 
  mostly desert, some urban scapes, and fills the space between the four corners. 
  Four Corners which rest on a flat surface - the film screen. We build our own 
  walls. The viewer can only experience distance.</p>
<p align="center"> <i>I'm sure of a distance from it, and I'm all for fabricating 
  as much distance as possible.</i><font size="2"><a href="footnotes.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#FFFFFF">15</font></a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><i> 
  </i></font></p>
<p align="left">One is not allowed into the postcard landscape, one is constantly 
  aware of oneself as the viewer, forced to be making connections between what 
  is seen and heard. <i>The mistake in it is to have believed that the reflection 
  of nature is nature</i>.<a href="footnotes.htm" target="_blank"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">16</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
  </font>This is a film about identity; James Benning made the film about himself. 
  An American self surrounded by degenerating city scapes and an unapproachable 
  landscape. The west is still wild.</p>
