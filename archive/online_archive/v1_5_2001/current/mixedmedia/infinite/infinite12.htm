<p><font size="3">It is easy to imagine the scene, in the epic historical dramatic 
  film version of Mina Loy's life, where Arthur Cravan sails away never to be 
  seen again. It is easy to imagine how wrong it will be. The blurb on the back 
  of the biography of Mina Loy says "Loy's life is the stuff of Hollywood legend: 
  it would (and probably will!) make a great movie . . ." Rich colors, a fantastic 
  opportunity for a costume designer and an art director. Recreating Mina's clothes. 
  Her self-decorated apartments. Those lamp shades. </font></p>
