<p>Nina Fonoroff''s beautifully fragmented film<i> The Accursed Mazurka</i> chronicles 
  a woman's mental illness. Her own experience of this illness. The subject, now 
  distanced, now clinical, is herself. Bits of images, bits of sound, remembrances 
  personal and cultural (she ignores the copyright - doesn't Rogers and Hammerstein 
  belong to her generation) woven and layered upon each other to make a whole. 
  (That is if one accounts for the hole in a whole.) A woman opens and closes 
  a set of venetian blinds. The patterned light falls into the room and is shut 
  out. Different voices read the medical logs of a patient separated from her 
  body, a body swimming in a depression. She feels distanced from her own body 
  an observer unable to intervene. A biographer? An artists work is sometimes 
  referred to as her body of work. The separation of Fonoroff from her film is 
  one of the elements of the films success. No victimization here, no blame, no 
  confessions, just the richness of an experience, that, as the voice over remarks, 
  was a curse or perhaps a blessing. </p>

<p>Optical printing allows for the mixing, reframing, general alteration of the 
  image. A moment captured is no necessary truth. Peeling, layering, one image 
  on top of another, in the negative, upside down, sometimes this is closer to 
  the experience of the mind. The Doctor writes for the experience of the mind. 
  To distill the imagination. To explode words. This is different from psychoanalysis. 
  Fonoroff's film ends on the note of not allocating blame, of not looking to 
  the family for the answers, of not singing to the narrative of psychoanalysis. 
  Development continues, it does not stop at childhood. Experience is the richness 
  of the blends of images and sounds which make up our environments, an experience 
  that at times our body must withdraw from.</p>
