        marks a crucial juncture in the history of avant-garde writing in America. 
        Feminist avant-garde poets from the 1910s onward have occupied an anomalous 
        position in American letters, resisting the frequent masculinism of avant-garde 
        rhetoric while seeking to forge alternatives, most often without an awareness 
        of a feminist “usable past” from which to draw. Modern-period women avant-gardists—notably 
        Mina Loy, among many others—remained preoccupied by debates with contemporaneous 
        avant-garde groups. By contrast, for more recent women poets, a rich dialogue 
        is enacted not just with a range of contemporaries but with a diverse 
        representation of female (and feminist) precursors. As <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        first showed, women avant-gardists are increasingly creating specifically 
        feminist avant-garde traditions—a various lineage that explores the relationship 
        between the constructions of gender and race and the structures of language.</font></span> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span>            
        </span>The editors of <i>HOW(ever)</i> asserted several goals for the 
        journal: to nurture a community of avant-garde writers caught between 
        the divergent camps of a “mainstream” feminist poetics and the largely 
        male circles of the literary avant-garde; to foster dialogue between contemporary 
        women poets and feminist scholars; and to recuperate women avant-gardists 
        of the modern period. In 1992, in the final issue of <i>HOW(ever)</i>, 
        editor Kathleen Fraser summed up the situation that had led to the journal’s 
        founding nine years earlier:</span> </font>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">we felt unfamilied, 
          without a place in which to find or assert our own particular hybrids. 
          Unpredictable by definition, “the new” seemed to have become quickly 
          over-prescriptive in journals shaped by various male-dominant poetics 
          or a feminist editorship whose tastes/politics did not acknowledge much 
          of the poetry we felt to be central to our moment—the continuously indefinable, 
          often “peculiar” writings being pieced together by women refusing the 
          acceptable norms. We wanted to make a place for these writers. But we 
          weren’t fond of the grip of rules nor the territorial claims of the 
          male manifesto tradition...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We were interested 
          in how works were freshly constructed and language reanimated within 
          the experience of “female”-gendered lives.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=HTMLBody style='
'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>            </span>            
                                                        —<i>HOW(ever)</i> 6.4 
        (1992): 15.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>This 
        statement—its desire for “family” and its inquiry into what constitutes 
        the “female” in women’s lives—reflects Fraser’s sense of the marginalization 
        of feminist avant-garde writing and theorizing in the circles of both 
        second-wave feminism and a burgeoning radical poetics. As one example, 
        elsewhere Fraser points to the exclusion of Barbara Guest from “a major 
        anthology of the works of the New York School” (ed. David Shapiro, 1970), 
        an “erasure [that] was my first in-person encounter with this common historic 
        practice.”(“Tradition” 57). As she notes, anthologies through the mid-1980s 
        consistently ignored the work of women experimentalists, while representing 
        a tradition that comfortably included “Joyce, Beckett, Olson, and Ashbery”(Hogue 
        17), and indeed Fraser’s formal education had supplied no introduction 
        to female modernists.(“Tradition” 54-5) Fraser was not alone in observing 
        such omissions. Shari Benstock argues in a 1984 article that the history 
        of modernism still ignored the work of women innovators, and Susan Howe 
        similarly observes not just that the “American practice” of a poetics 
        that “involves a fracturing of discourse, a breaking of boundaries of 
        all sorts” has been largely excluded from the canon, but that even “when 
        the history of this sub sub group gets written even here women get shut 
        up or out.”(Howe 192-3)</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span>            
        </span>In the late 1970s, Fraser had begun to teach graduate seminars 
        “in feminist poetics and modernist women writers.” Increasingly, in these 
        classes, “working methods [of young women poets] began to include collage, 
        disruption, and sentence fragmentation....Often these works were inspired 
        by the poems and poetic prose of Woolf, Stein, Loy, H.D., Djuna Barnes, 
        Moore, Richardson, Jean Rhys, and Niedecker, all of which investigated 
        states of female mind and experience.”(Boland and Fraser 388) Yet the 
        texts of these precursors remained largely invisible to critics. As Fraser 
        tells it, “Poetry scholarship seemed to be comfortable with Dickinson 
        and then, with the exception of a minimal nod to Marianne Moore, Elizabeth 
        Bishop, and H.D., to jump over the major innovations of modernist women 
        writers.”(Hogue 16) Like Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Carolyn Burke, and other 
        feminists interested in the avant-garde, Fraser began questioning why 
        there was “no acknowledged tradition of modernist women’s poetry continuing 
        out of H.D., Stein, Dorothy Richardson, Woolf, Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes,” 
        among others.(“Tradition” 61) At the same time that scholars engaged in 
        “gynocriticism”—rediscovering and proffering readings of neglected women’s 
        texts, often fiction, by such writers as Kate Chopin, Charlotte Perkins 
        Gilman, and others—the erasure of modernist women innovators was increasingly 
        brought home to Fraser. At the same time, as Fraser recalled in conversation 
        with me, even in the absence of a body of criticism about such writers, 
        “We began to understand the link back to modernist women that we didn't 
        know had been our family.”</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span>            
        </span>As she noted in the above statement about the founding of <i>HOW(ever)</i>, 
        in addition to facing the erasure of feminist avant-garde precursors Fraser 
        tackled an uncomfortable division between male-dominated avant-garde journals 
        and an emerging feminist poetics that privileged what she calls a “common 
        language” aesthetic: Fraser mentions the editorial limitations and frequent 
        sexism of “both the mainstream and more avant-garde publications” of the 
        1970s and 1980s (Hogue 17), yet she found problematic as well the feminist 
        “call for the immediately accessible language of personal experience as 
        a binding voice of women’s strength.”(“Tradition” 58) For many feminists, 
        “the emphasis on finding a common language through poetry was crucial 
        to forging community and establishing a shared identity. But there never 
        seemed to be a comfortable place for experimental women poets.”(Boland 
        and Fraser 398) As second-wave feminism gained momentum, “It was as if 
        women were being told that we couldn’t afford the ‘luxury’ of the more 
        experimentalist texts, in a period urgently focused on female identity 
        and its instatement in the mainstream culture. Some even equated innovative 
        practice with ‘elitism.’”(Hogue 16-17)</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span>            
        </span>Indeed, poet-activists aimed to generate new awareness of female 
        experience, often by exploring previously taboo subjects. As the title 
        of the 1973 anthology <i>No More Masks!</i> suggests, this approach urged 
        political awareness by means of the “naked” truth and an intensely personal 
        voice; as the anthology’s title also indicates, a key predecessor in this 
        poetic tradition was not an experimentalist such as H.D. or Stein, but 
        Muriel Rukeyser, who famously asked, “What would happen if one woman told 
        the truth about her life?/The world would split open.” Developing this 
        largely confessional mode, feminist movement poetry emphasized open form 
        and political message. According to Kim Whitehead, feminist poets were 
        driven by a need “to avoid alienating the rank and file of the women’s 
        movement through the use of the elite’s poetic techniques,”(27) which, 
        as Fraser argues, included any “inaccessible” or unrecognizable avant-garde 
        experimentation with syntax, diction, or form. As Jan Clausen later noted 
        of 1970s feminist poetry, “what had begun as an anti-traditional movement 
        had to a certain extent developed its own dogmas, conventions, cautions, 
        clichés, taboos,” including a prevailing “obsession with accessibility.”(31, 
        23)</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Fraser 
        strongly felt that “feminist and traditional critics [were] failing to 
        develop any interest in contemporary women poets working to bring structural 
        and syntactic innovation into current poetic practice,” and she was hungry 
        for “a place where our issues could be aired and some new choices put 
        forward in women’s poetry—asserted and selected by women.” It was in this 
        spirit that Fraser, Beverly Dahlen, and Frances Jaffer founded <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        with the goal of connecting contemporary innovation to “a revival of modernist 
        figures.” The name <i>HOW(ever)</i> itself enacts this crucial, and fluid, 
        lineage. Alluding to a phrase from Moore’s “Poetry,” signified to Fraser 
        “an addendum, a point of view from the margins.”(“Tradition” 61-3) The 
        first line of “Poetry” famously confides, “I, too, dislike it,” but the 
        poem continues: “Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it one 
        discovers in/it after all, a place for the genuine.”(Moore<i> </i>36) 
        Launching what DuPlessis called a “formal and intellectual critique which 
        did feminist cultural work”[<i>HOW(ever)</i> 6.4 (1992): 14], the journal 
        joined the ranks of the many feminist publishing collectives that had 
        thrived since the late 1960s. But it did so with a crucial difference: 
        the much-needed purpose of voicing an alternative poetics largely ignored 
        in scholarly, activist, and literary circles. <i>HOW(ever)</i> first gave 
        voice to what I see as a burgeoning feminist avant-garde tradition—a strain 
        of women’s dissent that, since the early 20th century, has sought to unsettle 
        the gendered rudiments of language.</span> </font>
