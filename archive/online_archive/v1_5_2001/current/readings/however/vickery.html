      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>HOW(ever)</span></i> began in 1983, more as a broadsheet 
        than a journal, with sixteen to eighteen pages (8½ by 11 inches) stapled 
        together in an inexpensive format. It was modeled on Carla Harryman’s 
        journal <i>Qu</i>, of which each issue could be read in one sitting.  
        After considering titles such as “Parts of Speech,” “Feminine Endings<i>,</i>” 
        “Indefinite Article,” “Alice Blue Gown,” “Red Tulips,” and “Para/phrase,” 
        Fraser, Dahlen, and Jaffer finally decided on <i>HOW(ever)</i>. These 
        provisional titles point to a range of possible influences from Gertrude 
        Stein to French feminist theory. The eventual title alludes to Marianne 
        Moore’s lines about poetry: “I, too, dislike it./However, there is a place 
        for it.” As Frances Jaffer suggests, the very title of the journal suggests 
        a second take after all the givens, or the “exception.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
title=""><span>[1]</span></a> There are no equal signs here; language is seen 
        to inscribe processes of power rather than a democracy of phonemes.  </font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Significantly, the shorthand 
        occasionally used for the journal’s title was <i>H(er)</i>, which foregrounds 
        not only the journal’s feminine focus but also its ties to a modernist 
        avant-garde of women’s writing. The possessive pronoun signals a territorialization, 
        the mapping out of an alternative space to other poetic formations. <i>H(er)</i> 
        also echoes H.D.’s abbreviated title for <i>HERmione</i>. It would be 
        particularly appropriate for Dahlen, whose admiration of H.D.’s writing 
        (including <i>Helen in Egypt</i>) moved her to write <i>The Egyptian Poems</i>. 
        Like Language writing, <i>HOW(ever)</i> emphasized process and method 
        in the foregrounding of the word <i>how</i>. As Fraser pointed out much 
        later, “Perhaps the most pivotal factor in <i>HOW(ever)</i>’s creation 
        was the urgency to provide alternatives to the romantic <i>I</i> of fixed 
        unilateral authority…”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span>[2]</span></a>  
        </font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The opening editorial 
        statements suggest that <i>HOW(ever)</i> began with a complex editorial 
        policy, only part of which was to reclaim forgotten or marginalized modernist 
        women writers and artists. According to Fraser, “<i>HOW(ever)</i> proposes 
        to make a bridge between scholars thinking about women’s language issues, 
        vis-à-vis the making of poetry, and the women making those poems.”<a
href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span>[3]</span></a> She thus aimed the 
        marketing of <i>HOW(ever)</i> at two potential audiences: one academic; 
        the other, comprising women writers not affiliated with institutions. 
        As Fraser notes, the first issue of <i>HOW(ever)</i> was published when 
        “women’s writing” was beginning to be recognized in the academy. Issues 
        that continued to be the focus of scholars or editors at this time included 
        the following:</font></p>

      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In particular, Fraser 
        was interested in theoretical issues that arose when women’s innovative 
        writing was combined with political practice. However, she resisted the 
        idea of a “common language” because it was another way of prescribing 
        the field of “women’s poetry.” Building on the idea of difference within 
        community, Fraser hoped to move away from both master narratives and prosodic 
        patterns in order to show that “our hearts did not belong to Daddy” or, 
        for that matter, to a substituted “mommy” figure still common in feminist 
        strategies of reversal<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span>[5]</span></a> 
        She argued that an all-women editorial collective was a necessary part 
        of the <i>HOW(ever)</i> project: “It is probably realistic to speculate 
        that even as many male writers were extremely supportive of our undertaking, 
        had any one of them been an active voice in our collective editorial labors, 
        a discretely different sum ‘product’ would have emerged.”<a href="#_edn6"
name="_ednref6" title=""><span>[6]</span></a> Fraser felt that men would bring 
        along their own histories, as well as a specifically male style of logic 
        and argument. By working independently, the <i>HOW(ever)</i> editorial 
        group was free to figure out issues one by one.</font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this respect, Fraser 
        seems aware of the likely epistemic and behavioral inflections of gender. 
        Frances Jaffer, in her opening editorial statement, also outlined a praxis 
        that focused on “what can be written in other than traditional syntactical 
        or prosodical structures may give an important voice to authentic female 
        experience.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span>[7]</span></a> 
        As the writing, working notes, and letters featured in <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        reveal, the “truths” of female experience were interpreted broadly, covering 
        a diverse range of subject positions. What became apparent was that no 
        one tendency in form or style captured experience more accurately than 
        any other.  </font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Looking back at <i>HOW(ever)</i>. 
        Fraser reflects that it was a model “not just for a different kind of 
        writing but for the assertion of editorial choices by women.”<a
href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span>[8]</span></a> There was no hard-and-fast 
        editorial policy: “We had to trust our individual responses, our discretionary 
        sense of authenticity and difficult pleasure, to acknowledge variable 
        tastes and persuasions as the work began arriving.” Primarily, they were 
        looking for “that which had not yet been uttered because forms were still 
        being imagined to contain those unsayables.” She notes that although conflicts 
        often occurred in the editorial process, the use of a collective form 
        helped clarify the reasons for their choices.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span>[9]</span></a> 
        It was important to argue for the “necessity and value of a certain work, 
        to ask for reconsideration when there was a strong difference, [and] to 
        think even more closely about why or how a particular piece was causing 
        excitement in one of us and not in another,” for to do so was to open 
        up and interrogate powerful and persistent ideas of cultural value.<a
href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span>[10]</span></a></font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This editorial conversation 
        was supported by the inclusion of a “Working Note” for each poet, the 
        only requirement that <i>HOW(ever)</i> imposed upon its contributors. 
        The “Working Note” was to give some idea of the processes that had gone 
        into the production, and of any formal problems proposed or encountered. 
        This was to reinforce the idea that no text is produced in in a vacuum, 
        but always within a social and aesthetic field. The end of each issue 
        also included a section called “alerts,” set aside for informal commentary 
        and information on new or neglected books by innovative women poets. Its 
        informality encouraged a flexible form of criticism, although it still 
        maintained a far more traditional form than the reviews published by <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i>.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span>[11]</span></a> 
        There was also a “postcards” section which included letters that commented 
        on past reviews or offered information on forthcoming work. Finally, the 
        editors’ notes provided updates on new or forthcoming books, conferences, 
        and readings.</font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While focusing primarily 
        on the literary, <i>HOW(ever)</i> also drew attention to relevant topics 
        in film theory and art. The second issue initiated a visual aesthetic 
        in order to promote similar conversations along a parallel track. Subsequent 
        issues presented art works which generally foregrounded the structural, 
        such as “alphabets, words, [and] de-composition.” This initiative was 
        Fraser’s, whose interest in art was both intense and long standing. Fraser 
        thought that to juxtapose visual work alongside written texts would enact 
        a convergence that would provoke further processes of thought or points 
        of attention. She hoped to give space to “writing as different in its 
        goals and its ‘product’ as a painting by Nancy Spero or Elizabeth Murray 
        was from a picture by [Willem] DeKooning or David Salle.”<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span>[12]</span></a> 
        Such expansions complemented the business of exploding genre, and showed 
        innovative poetry on a broader and more interdisciplinary scale to traditional 
        literary histories.  </font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:

style='font-size:12.0pt'> further set out to show that American and Canadian women 
        writers participate in a common tradition. Frequent postings in the “alerts” 
        and “postcards” section of new Canadian books or forthcoming events in 
        Canada are evidence of this. To a lesser extent, British news was forwarded 
        by writers like Wendy Mulford. By listing Simone de Beavoir and Luce Irigaray 
        alongside Shulamith Firestone and Nancy Chodorow in the very first issue, 
        Fraser also brought together what were seen as quite separate—even conflicting—directions 
        in feminism, namely French feminism and Anglo-American feminism. In doing 
        so, she foregrounded differences within feminism, as well as framing the 
        multiplicity of feminisms that <i>HOW(ever)</i> hoped to feature.</span></font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>One 
        of Fraser’s declared aims in <i>HOW(ever)</i> was to present a set of 
        writings from both “established feminist scholars and working poets” that 
        would move critical discourse beyond those “readings” which sought to 
        impose interpretations on texts from without. As such, she hoped that 
        her journal would enable the two disciplines to cross-fertilize in an 
        encouragingly unofficial space. While poets were implicated in this endeavor 
        by being required to supply a “Working Note” on their practices, Fraser 
        notes that the editors were largely unsuccessful in soliciting any material 
        from critics that did not simply develop an argument with the usual footnotes. 
        She and the other editors put considerable effort into encouraging submissions: 
        </span></font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        sent out a large number of personal letters of friendly invitation to 
        feminist scholars and essayists whose work I discovered in my reading.  
        We handed out flyers at regional and national MLA sessions and at conferences 
        on H.D. and E[mily] D[ickinson] and V[irginia] W[oolf], inviting contributions…but 
        with mostly silence in return.<a href="#_edn13"
name="_ednref13" title=""><span>[13]</span></a>  </font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Although Fraser suggests that academic feminists were 
        not yet ready to move out of a male-dominant academic practice, <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        was also competing for attention against emergent scholarly journals such 
        as <i>Signs</i>, <i>Feminist Studies</i>, <i>Frontiers</i> and <i>Heresies</i>, 
        most of which were refereed and therefore preferable outlets for the work 
        of career academics.</span></font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fraser says she had 
        “envisaged…a place for informal, incomplete response to current and historical 
        works, with particular emphasis on recovery of texts, letters, critical 
        reputations of lost or dimming modernist women writers.” The issue of 
        preservation and cultural memory was of fundamental importance. The brackets 
        around the “ever” in the journal’s title could be seen as a symbolic closing 
        off of any future for women’s work. “[W]e hardly ever heard about their 
        poems where I was sitting listening,” she writes. “You mean in school? 
        I mean where poems were being preserved and thought about seriously and 
        carried forward as news.”<a
href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span>[14]</span></a> Borrowing from 
        Pound’s “literature is news that STAYS news,” Fraser is concerned here 
        not only with the cultural recovery of past women writers, but also with 
        those canonical processes by which the work of present women writers will 
        be made over into a past. She astutely realizes that such survival will 
        depend, for the most part, on the community of feminist academics. While 
        staging itself as opening up a dialogue between writers and critics, <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        is in fact an early intervention into the institutionalization of poetry. 
        As Fraser notes in an editorial preface, “<i>HOW(ever)</i> hopes to create 
        a place in which poets can talk to scholars through poems and working 
        notes on those poems, as well as through commentary on neglected women 
        poets who were/are making textures and structures of poetry in the tentative 
        region of the untried.”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15"
title=""><span>[15]</span></a></font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Her project focused 
        on the academy in several ways. Significantly, the editorial group formation 
        was quite traditional in structure, with a chief editor (Kathleen Fraser), 
        associate editors (Frances Jaffer and Beverly Dahlen), and contributing 
        editors (Rachel Blau DuPlessis and Carolyn Burke). The inclusion of the 
        latter guaranteed an academic editorial perspective. DuPlessis actively 
        promoted innovative writing in scholarly journals and at conferences while 
        publishing her poetry in small presses. Given her interest in <i>écriture 
        féminine</i> and the French women’s movement, Burke could elaborate on 
        the aesthetic and political connections between French feminism and experimental 
        women’s writing. Both editors would therefore be invaluable in shaping 
        an intertext between the academic and the poetic. Another function of 
        <i>HOW(ever)</i>’s editorial structure was to indicate the degree of individual 
        involvement in its publication. The withdrawal of Beverly Dahlen enabled 
        Susan Gevirtz to take on the workload of an associate editor. As <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        evolved, the constitution of its editorial would gradually change. Towards 
        the end, Myung Mi Kim and Meredith Stricker produced three issues as guest 
        editors.<a
href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span>[16]</span></a></font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps the major site 
        of contestation in <i>HOW(ever)</i> was the debate over poetic form. This 
        was particularly evident after the publication in a guest-edited issue 
        of an article by Annie Finch titled “The Sonnet Transfigured.” Three original 
        members of the editorial collective—Beverly Dahlen, Kathleen Fraser, and 
        Rachel Blau DuPlessis—were moved to respond to Finch’s call for a reclamation 
        of the sonnet form. All three disagreed with Finch’s contention that “poetry 
        is to stop fear,” and that “the structure of the sonnet” as “a way of 
        organizing, channeling and making familiar” is particularly well suited 
        for doing this. <a href="#_edn17"
name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> </font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">DuPlessis argued that 
        the desire to situate oneself in relation to power—to take hold of or 
        “ride” power, as Finch suggests—does not make it necessary to opt for 
        the sonnet form.  And for DuPlessis, the use of fixed forms as “stylistics 
        counters” to anxiety or fear was implausible. In such circumstances, it 
        is best to ask what “romantic” might mean in the context of the sonnet. 
        Its recuperation, she suggested, “is only possible within a full analysis 
        of lyric ideology, beauty, and pleasure.” As a genre, the sonnet is “already 
        historically filled with voiceless, beautiful female figures in object 
        position.” Since these are rendered as muses, the sonnet is more of a 
        “son-net” (or medium of a male subject) than a “sound-net” which emphasizes 
        different voices.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span>[18]</span></a>  
        </font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While DuPlessis recognized 
        that for some women writers the muse is arguably a male force, for many 
        others it is female—“maternal, mirroring, lesbian...” DuPlessis seems 
        to add difference <i>per se</i> as a recognizably female force, for she 
        continues to list the female muse “as a child; a family configuration; 
        a community; an old, wise, mischief elf; a dark-colored person; a light-colored 
        person; a force transcendent; a force chthonic…” DuPlessis then encompassed 
        all other difference in a binary model of sex/gender, stating that “[t]he 
        muse for women is labile &amp; bisexed, bigendered.”<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19"
title=""><span>[19]</span></a> This is problematic because it not only elides 
        sexualities within an either-or model but also attempts to fit different 
        sorts of influence into a prioritized sexual paradigm.</font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fraser responds by expressing 
        her concern at Finch’s either/or attitude towards the use of traditional 
        forms. For Finch, the surviving poet might choose to align herself as 
        struggling writer either with the sonnet of the humble and lower-case 
        “i” or with the sonnet of the powerful and even frightening upper-case<i> 
        I.</i> Fraser suggested that to surrender to traditional binary descriptions 
        merely reinforces such “false” structures and that Finch’s bind “is indeed 
        double since it seems to dismiss or discount a third existing position 
        provided for us by dozens of formally transgressive works written by women 
        poets,” namely the exploration of “alternative poetic models and strategies.” 
        As Fraser pointed out, much “breakthrough works of poetry by women and 
        men have engaged the traditional sonnet, etc., by brilliantly reversing, 
        unhinging and <i>trans</i>figuring it.”<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span>[20]</span></a> 
        Her examples included the sonnets of Laura Riding, Bernadette Mayer’s 
        <i>Sonnets</i>, and Alice Notley’s <i>When I Was Alive</i>.</font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fraser found Finch’s 
        position further problematic in privileging the sonnet tradition as some 
        law or authority which must be addressed, “as if it were a Jungian shadow 
        to be conquered.” Her point is that “[w]hen one linguistically links the 
        act of making a poem to that hierarchic purpose of winning and/or maintaining 
        control over chaos with familiar ‘technology’ and methods of ‘writing 
        efficiency,’ one risks courting the clichéd counterpart of this male tradition: 
        ‘female inadequacy.’” Furthermore, arguments about the sonnet tradition 
        illustrate a larger debate over margins and center: “Isn’t it that very 
        attempt to align oneself with an acknowledged center, to win approved 
        product status from the representatives of <i>any</i> established center, 
        that throws the marginalized poet into a condition of fragility and mute 
        chase?”<a

        same issue as the responses by Dahlen, Fraser and DuPlessis (summer 1991), 
        Norma Cole emphasized the importance of determining who speaks when considering 
        poetic form. As Cole points out, readers “are accustomed to having male 
        writing in female characters’ mouths.”<a href="#_edn22"
name="_ednref22" title=""><span>[22]</span></a> She points to the recent practice 
        of gender reversal, as when Carla Harryman puts words into the mouths 
        of androgynous or genderless figures, or when Leslie Scalapino puts words 
        into the mouths of male characters. Arguing for the highly subversive 
        effects of such practices, Cole’s observation rests uneasily alongside 
        Jaffer’s initial call for the representation of women’s lives. Indeed, 
        such strategies are perhaps more contentious as a feminist practice than 
        a return to the sonnet form.  </font></p>

        the term <i>HOW(ever)</i> is often used to denote a specific group of 
        feminist poets attracted a specific group of feminist poets (such as Fraser, 
        Dahlen, Jaffer, Gevirtz, and DuPlessis), the journal itself managed to 
        include a wide variety of feminist practices. Black writers and poets 
        from ethnic minorities, such as Sheila K. Smith, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, 
        and Myung Mi Kim, were presented alongside British writers like Wendy 
        Mulford and Pamela Stewart. For the first time, working projects by both 
        Canadian writers of the feminine (écriture au féminin) and Language writers 
        could be presented in the same forum. The range of contemporary poetry 
        featured in <i>HOW(ever) </i>undid the presumption that there was merely 
        one tradition or politics of practice. The journal also included writing 
        and information about modernist women who were otherwise considered noncanonical, 
        such as Mina Loy, as well as writers associated with later poetic communities 
        such as Lorine Niedecker and Barbara Guest.</span></font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">During its lifetime, 
        <i>HOW(ever)</i> was positioned confusingly as either a rival venture 
        to or subset of Language poetry. In his debate on Language writing with 
        Michael Davidson in <i>Sulfur</i>, Eliot Weinberger takes the opportunity 
        to stage a critical appraisal of <i>HOW(ever)</i>. He argued that, unlike 
        Language writing, <i>HOW(ever)</i> was “the most exciting group activity 
        occurring in American poetry today.”<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span>[23]</span></a> 
        Adrienne Rich, by contrast, collapses the project of <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        with that of Language poetry, when she refers to Susan Howe, Rachel Blau 
        DuPlessis, Kathleen Fraser, and Frances Jaffer as “the Feminist Language 
        poets.”<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span>[24]</span></a>

        of <i>HOW(ever)</i> and Language poetry is misleading. <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        is best viewed as operating alongside the community practices of Language 
        poetry, such that some women writers chose to participate in both. At 
        the same time as Fraser was forming <i>HOW(ever)</i>, Lyn Hejinian and 
        Barrett Watten were entertaining ideas for a similar project to be featured 
        as a special issue of <i>Poetics Journal</i>. This was the “Women and 
        Modernism” issue, which they began planning almost from the inception 
        of the journal. Originally, they had set a 15 March deadline for what 
        was expected to be the spring/summer 1983 issue. If that schedule had 
        been kept it would have coincided roughly with the first issue of <i>HOW(ever)</i>, 
        which appeared in May 1983.<a href="#_edn25"
name="_ednref25" title=""><span>[25]</span></a> Early that year, Hejinian outlined 
        the “Women and Modernism” issue in detail to prospective contributors 
        such as Susan Bee, noting that she and Watten wanted to present two types 
        of essays: “[O]ne dealing with questions in terms of earlier women writers 
        and artists (Stein, Laura Riding, H.D., etc.) and the other discussions 
        by and about current writers and artists and their own personal thoughts. 
        Which is to say, I am interested in both the historical and the’“personal’ 
        approach.”<a href="#_edn26"
name="_ednref26" title=""><span>[26]</span></a> Such a framework distinctly parallels 
        Fraser’s own editorial statement. Together, the “Women and Modernism” 
        issue and the ongoing project of <i>HOW(ever)</i> confirm and contextualize 
        one another, as well as providing a clear example of the illusory nature 
        of strict community boundaries. Indeed, along with Beverly Dahlen and 
        Carolyn Burke, Fraser would contribute essays to the “Women and Modernism” 
        issue.  </font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Criticism of <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        tended to focus less on its choice of writing than on its politics, and 
        particularly its exclusive interest in women’s writing and the prioritizing 
        of gender.  Some felt that <i>HOW(ever)</i> was in effect essentializing 
        or decontextualizing the writing. According to Jane Miller, for instance, 
        “[t]here is always a new sentence, a new voice, a new timing that needs 
        to be found, and it may come out of a female experience <i>but must be 
        transformed into something else</i>, larger, to move from construct into 
        art and from report into rite.” Although Miller agrees it is important 
        “to have one’s own sexual imaginings” or environment “mirrored in art,” 
        she believes that “Great poetry is always…about more than one thing.” 
        Besides, “[T]here’s a time and perhaps the time is now, when feminism 
        blocks transcendence (not to another world, but in this one) and is another 
        crutch…”<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span>[27]</span></a></font></p>

        that many reactions to <i>HOW(ever)</i> were grounded in old debates about 
        the “woman question.” She cites a review of <i>HOW(ever)</i> by Robert 
        Peters that illustrates the persistence of Victorian anxieties about women 
        writing. Noting that Gertrude Stein and H.D. “seem the primary goddesses 
        behind this sort of writing,” Peters stated that he had yet to meet anyone 
        who could remain excited “after twenty pages or so.” Arguing that “[a] 
        poem is not a set of easy metaphysical speculations on the nature of grammar, 
        guilt or the primal flood,” he concluded, “Let’s not keep the trope flying, 
        let’s strangle the little creature in his crib before he soils his pants 
        and screws up our life.”<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span>[28]</span></a> 
        The metaphor of infantilization parallels the one used by Wayne Koestenbaum 
        in theorizing the results of collaboration between male writers.<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><span>[29]</span></a> 
        While the “child” of such masculine literary processes is culturally acceptable, 
        textual births by women writers are deemed unnatural creations.</font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Peters’ comments are 
        part of a general backlash against the proliferation of feminist magazines. 
        In the face of this narrow-minded and negative reception, both the format 
        and practice of <i>HOW(ever)</i> have become a model for many other magazines. 
        Apart from journals like <i>Big Allis</i>, <i>Black Bread</i>,<i> Chain, 
        Motel, </i>and <i>6ix</i>, which are edited by women and present a forum 
        for contemporary women’s writing, the Canadian broadside <i>(f.)Lip</i> 
        most closely reflected <i>HOW(ever)</i>’s editorial practice.<a href="#_edn30"
name="_ednref30" title=""><span>[30]</span></a> As Fraser points out, <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        was deliberately modest in size, and therefore something which could be 
        read between work commitments and familial obligations. One of <i>(f.)Lip’</i>s 
        editors, Angela Hryniuk, states that their journal took a similar form 
        for the same reasons: indeed, it got its title partly for being something 
        that women could “flip” through. Aimed at formally innovative writers 
        and women in the academy, it also hoped to attract a broader community 
        of women readers. This ambition was not altogether successful. As Hryniuk 
        notes, “A lot of people who weren’t already reading similar writing or 
        weren’t in the academic community didn’t know what to do with us.” Consequently, 
        “[w]e had to deal with feminist anger that we weren’t like everyone else.”<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31"

        a much-needed community; the talent and invention of women poets is clearly

          It is unclear why the “Women and Modernism” issue was delayed for so 
          long that it appeared one year after the first issue of <i>HOW(ever)</i>.  
          The clash of schedules between the two would not have helped matters.</font></p>

          Lyn Hejinian, letter to Susan Bee, 26 February 1983, Hejinian Papers, 
          Mandeville (74, 2, 10).  Although Carla Harryman, Erica Hunt, and Diane 
          Ward proposed papers on Jane Bowles, Louis Zukofsky, and Bernadette 
          Mayer respectively, none would reach publication.  Hejinian also wanted 
          to expand the focus of the <i>Poetics Journal</i> issue to include articles 
          on art and film.  A primary distinction between <i>HOW(ever)</i> and 
          the “Women and Modernism” issue would be that one-third of the eventual 
          contributors to the latter would be male.  As with Fraser, Hejinian 
          hoped to attract an academic readership for the issue.  She told Susan 
          Bee that she and Watten planned to distribute the issue to Women’s Studies 
          programs.  See Lyn Hejinian, letter to Susan Bee, 23 March 1983, Hejinian

          </span>Wayne Koestenbaum argues that “men who collaborate engage in
