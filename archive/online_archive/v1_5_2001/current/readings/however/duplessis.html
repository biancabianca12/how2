      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My 
        association with <i>HOW(ever) </i>began when, in response to my essay 
        “For the Etruscans” and other work, Kathleen Fraser involved me as a corresponding 
        editor of the distinctive newsletter-format journal that she had just 
        founded. Beverly Dahlen and Frances Jaffer, the other first editorial 
        contributors, were also my friends and long-distance colleagues.</font></span> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It 
        is important to understand that Fraser&#146;s vision, commitment, power, 
        sense of style and nuance were the animating force of this journal at 
        all times. This journal was a remarkable cultural intervention, unifying 
        as it did an interest in “feminist” thematics (women&#146;s life, subjectivity, 
        narratives, pressures, choices, and agency) and what has been called a 
        “feminine” poetics—not, theoretically, limited to women, but involving 
        anti-closural, anti-Aristotelian sensibility, disparate centers of interest, 
        multiple vectors and tones, “beginning again and again,” and dialogic, 
        discursive variety.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In 
        the first issue, Vol I, no.1, May 1983, glossing the “however” motif in 
        two directions (towards feminists and towards avand-garde formations), 
        Frances Jaffer noted “Unhappily, most feminist publications have ignored 
        the experimentalist work which women are writing now and have been writing 
        since early in the century.” I knew this for a fact, since, at the same 
        time, I was working hard to make the publication with which I was closely 
        affiliated—<i>Feminist Studies</i>—receptive to such work. It&#146;s not 
        that experimental work was not-say, available in at least <i>one</i> such 
        venue. It's that it made no appreciable dent on anyone's sensibility, 
        so far as I could see. I served in a variety of ways on <i>Feminist Studies</i> 
        for about 15 years, first on the board as an editor most concerned for 
        literature and culture, helping to create its intense feminist analytic 
        stance. At a certain point in the late 70s and early 80s, I became the 
        Associate Editor for Creative Work. In that capacity I solicited work 
        from, and published Dodie Bellamy, Judith Small, Diane Glancy, Valerie 
        Fox, Lyn Hejinian, Rae Armantrout, Naomi Replansky, Cheryl Clarke, Kathleen 
        Fraser, Heather Thomas, Rosmarie Waldrop, and (I think) Beverly Dahlen 
        and Jaffer herself. Probably others as well. But the point is that Frances 
        was right: the presence of this work in a centrist-feminist though left-analytic 
        journal did not catch the attention of what Alicia Ostriker was going 
        to call the &#147;feminist poetry movement.&#148; Indeed, when I moved 
        from those editorial positions on <i>Feminist Studies</i> (to be simply 
        a manuscript consultant), Ostriker became the Associate Editor for Creative 
        Work. It would take a large cultural history of the braid of feminisms&#151;what 
        was acceptable, legible, visible, and meaningful and when&#151;to sort 
        out why the occlusion of work that did not participate in a realist or 
        apparently realist aesthetic occurred. To me it was the premature formation 
        of one feminist ethos that was taken, almost triumphally, as the whole 
        ethos. So, as I said, Frances Jaffer was right, despite such cross-over 
        efforts as the one I have just detailed.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If 
        you look at the second issue of <i>HOW(ever)</i> [I, 2 (October 1983)] 
        with a commentary on &#147;what's on my bookshelf&#148; by Fraser, you 
        will see that cross-over impetus working in the other direction.  Fraser 
        is proposing to assimilate as the ground for <i>HOW(ever)</i> academic 
        and university based work, mainly feminist, on women modernists by Friedman, 
        Perloff, Gubar, DeKoven, Burke, Ostriker, myself, Juhasz, and others, 
        and she adduces issues of journals ranging from<i> College English</i> 
        and <i>Feminist Studies</i> to <i>Montemora</i> and <i>Contemporary Literature</i>. 
        You can see that we were trying a certain kind of brave intervention&#151;literally 
        bridging a gap that was quite wide at first. It now seems clear that a 
        new generation of poets, critics, and poet-critics were paying some attention.</span> 
        </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Let 
        me say a word about Kathleen Fraser&#146;s editorship, for she was at 
        all moments the journal&#146;s animating force, giving time and life&#146;s 
        blood to the endeavor. The journal involved a brilliant repositioning 
        of forces already at work in the community of poets and poetics, but forces 
        that would not have gotten as effective a hearing without her intervention. 
        Fraser had a gift both for awareness of schools and for a utopian transcendence 
        of schools. Because of her struggle, when the literary history of these 
        decades is written, <i>HOW(ever)&#146;s</i> space, flexible and decisive, 
        will be seen to have contributed to poetry, poetics, and the burgeoning 
        study of innovative women writers in the university and in other institutions 
        of artistic production and reception, like the Poetry Project or Naropa.</span> 
        </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        nurtured four generations of women artists. Strange to say it this way, 
        but first, it nurtured the dead, but recoverable modernists, already the 
        subject of feminist criticism, and given further poetic currency in this 
        journal&#151;I am talking about H.D., Mina Loy, Marianne Moore, Gertrude 
        Stein, Lorine Niedecker, Dorothy Richardson. It gave serious attention 
        to living writers whose full reception had been blocked, twisted, or delayed: 
        Barbara Guest and Laura (Riding) Jackson. It seriously enhanced and engaged 
        the work of those poets of about the same generation as Fraser whose work 
        was brought into an intellectual and poetic community and seen in constellation 
        with each other even when poetic groupings had divided such women as individuals 
        (such as Armantrout, Notley, Harryman, Mulford, Owen, Cole, F. Howe and 
        S. Howe, myself and many more). Finally, it nourished a vibrant generation 
        of younger women poets. In a phrase, it made older modernists, understudied 
        writers, and current poets all contemporaries of the present.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><i>HOW(ever)&#146;s</i> 
        and Fraser&#146;s editorial position repeatedly made the point that these 
        issues in dissemination and reception of women&#146;s work were part of 
        one recurring problem in the twentieth century. Fraser made this point 
        not punitively or dourly, but by creating an effervescence and excitement 
        about the recovery and new presentation of work by innovative women. In 
        part because of its brevity, each issue had zip. It had&#151;if this is 
        not too wild a thought&#151;a feminist Poundean flair&#151; &#147;ideas 
        into action.&#148; <i>HOW(ever)</i> was prescient and forward-looking 
        (with issues focused by topic, with statements in poetics and worksheets, 
        with elegant visuals)&#151;those are ideas that a more recent journal 
        like <i>Chain</i> has picked up (ed. Jena Osman and Juliana Spahr). The 
        recent anthology by Mary Margaret Sloan called <i>Moving Borders: Three 
        Decades of Innovative Writing by Women</i> (Talisman House,1998) and the 
        forthcoming anthology edited by Laura Hinton and Cynthia Hogue <i>(&#145;We 
        Who Love to Be Astonished&#146;: Experimental Women's Writing and Performance 
        Poetics</i>, University of Alabama Press, 2001) are also clearly indebted 
        to the ethos, poetics, and intellectual position taken by <i>HOW(ever)</i>.</span>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I 
        could say again what I said in January 1992-nine years after the first 
        issue&#151;when asked to comment on the existence of this journal that 
        was, apparently going to cease. I wrote:</span> </font> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">HOW(ever) was a 
          bridge between underknown modernist women and ourselves. It continued 
          radical modernism. It was a space of positive resistance to and powerful 
          critique of the period style in poetry, making a formal and intellctual 
          critique that did feminist cultural work. It was a space for heteroglossias, 
          for conflictual discourses. It was a space for radical eagerness, for 
          swift shifts, for coupure and splicing. It was a place in which one 
          felt comfortable, buoyant, testing many genres (ode, pensée, essay) 
          and many arts (sounds, as if music; visual fields, as if collage). It 
          was a space for a sisterhood of exploration. I am grateful to have had 
          it&#151;grateful most especially to the generosity, brilliance, and 
          labor of Kathleen Fraser, its founder and editor. I see the fruits of 
          its experiment in many places now. But still, I am sorry that its time 
          is up.</font>
