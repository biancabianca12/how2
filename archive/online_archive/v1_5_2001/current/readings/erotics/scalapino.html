        Mayer’s choice is writing as “experiments” in the scientific sense of 
        a set of perimeters or structure designed to enable discovery (“an operation 
        carried out under controlled conditions in order to discover an unknown 
        effect or law”). Examples of this mode are her books <i>Studying Hunger</i> 
        and <i>Midwinter Day</i>, the first being a month-long period-of-time 
        as structure of the book, the second being a single day as the structure/process 
        of the experiment. The pressure or the looseness of time in (or as being) 
        a designated time-period has itself an effect on what occurs <i>then</i>.</font></span>

        only barely separates observation and analysis. The discrepancy (language-border 
        <i>not being the same</i> as memory) is the code that transcribes an event?</span><br>
        <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayer 
        says:”I had an idea before this that if a human, a writer, could come 
        up with a workable code, or shorthand, for the transcription of every 
        event, every motion, every transition of his or her own mind, &amp; could 
        perform this process of translation on himself, using the code, for a 
        24-hour period, he or we or someone could come up with a great piece of

        Mayer has to be separated from the experience by the structure/design 
        of the experiment. </span> <br>
        <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>She may mean transcription of every event, every motion, 
        every transition of one’s mind—is looking intensely at the mind’s present, 
        which dissolves memory and language border. In this dissolution the two, 
        <i>always separate from each other but as if ‘solely’ able to transcribe 
        each other</i>, are simultaneous.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be no lineage 
        in order to see what the mind is. That’s just a construct, also. As lineage

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Transcription (as writing) of mind or transcription of 
        one’s/the person’s characteristics is different from the “social.” This 
        is related to lineage.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the relation 
        of one’s mind to people’s behavior (including one’s own). Writing is itself 
        separation of these and could see relation—by showing they aren’t ‘as’ 
        each other, aren’t manifestations of each other.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Behavior” implies “long-term” 
        and also “transient”—people’s patterns, but which are events. Behavior 
        is fact/action/events, and also characteristics and repetition.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If writing is viewed 
        as a given or prior form, then it is not the relation between a mind and 
        (that person’s or people’s) behavior.</span> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>If writing’s form is <i>mind-formations</i> it is a relation 
        to people’s behavior, outside one. In parks say. We’d see our relation 
        to our own mind. “One formulation of emptiness characterizes it as absence 
        of true or inherent existence within phenomena. In the alternative linguistic 
        formulation, however, emptiness is characterized as the fact that the 
        referent labeled by a term is not found when searched for by an analysis 
        that examines the ultimate nature of the object. As a corollary...nothing

        free-floating model, a hierarchical model of allusion-based writing is 
        streams of quotations from, or allusions to, luminous ‘figures’ who become 
        figures only (by being simply ‘referred to,’ a hidden support in, and 
        of, a fabric of such)—or they are ‘figures’ by being quoted briefly in 
        a stream (in a series of epiphanies, as if anthologizing or it has the 
        same effect as anthologizing). The form of the fabric of allusions seems 
        thus to transcribe ‘them,’ the people. And the substance and connections

        <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ‘meaning’ 
        or ‘ideology’ of the fabric is the revered ‘being’ (not the thought or 
        writing) of the referenced person. Thus while apparently submissive, the 
        fabric of allusions is a hidden narrative.</span> <br>
        <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, 
        academic format assigns lineage and describes a poet’s body of work <i>in</i> 
        relation to that prior manifestation or example. It is as if history or 
        thought is hierarchical and a poet’s work is only seen in that hierarchy. 
        What occurs as the shape/motion or sound that is the language is not in 
        the description or seen to be there, only the writing’s relation to other 
        things—that is, the background and its connections to the present are 
        not assessed, rather the background is simply reified. In that way, background 
        and present are both inert.</span> <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is suggesting an 
        anti-rationalist bombardment of one’s own mind by/and writing being always 
        (only, that is essentially) literary allusion. As language it is separate

        rely. To risk even inertia ‘to see what’s there.’ “Whalen’s doing something 
        very difficult” (Charles Bernstein observed, noting the sound as the different 
        readers’ rendering of Philip Whalen’s poems in a two-hour group reading 
        from Whalen’s <i>Overtime</i> at St. Mark’s in New York, May 6 1999).<kbd>(<a href="#note7">7</a>)<a name="text7"></a><br>

        Bernstein pointed out, even risking inertia in the writing so as not to 
        hold onto any particular element (such as continued sound pattern or there 
        being resonance)—the writing to be simply phenomena.<br>

        even plateaus—seems that momentarily. Where a fabric is pushed to no resonance 
        or to inertia and no conclusion or no structure. “[W]ords do have referents, 
        but these referents have no substance to them, being themselves merely 
        labeled entities that depend on other labeled entities in a giant web 
        where the only reality is the interrelatedness of the entities. There 
        is no real substratum to this...and the only existence that things can 
        be said to have is a very weak, conventional one that is reflected in 
        the patterns of interconnection, that is, in the usage of language. What 
        emerges is a picture of a world of elements in free fall. Because they 
        all fall at the same rate, however, there is the appearance of solidity; 
        but in fact there is no stable substratum on which they all rest.”<kbd>(<a href="#note9">9</a>)</kbd>
