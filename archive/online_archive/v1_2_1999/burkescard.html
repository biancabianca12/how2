        from Carolyn Burke</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i>When Does Scholarship 
        Become Fodder for Fiction: The Case of Mina Loy</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear HOW2 editors 
        and readers,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mina Loy's life is 
        the stuff of drama. Given her expatriate experience, participation in 
        the radical art movements of the early twentieth century, and romance 
        with the boxer/poet Arthur Cravan, it is not surprising that her life 
        has been recast in a work of fiction. It is disturbing to note, however, 
        that Antonia Logue's novel <i>Shadow-Box</i> (Bloomsbury, Grove/Atlantic, 
        1999) relies heavily on my biography<i> Becoming Modern, The Life of Mina 
        Loy </i>(Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1996)--not only for historical facts 
        but also for overarching themes, treatment and interpretation of cultural 
        milieux, and in some cases, narrative structures. A comparison of the 
        two books shows that while Logue sought to transform this material, her 
        novel piggybacks on my work, often interweaving innovative parts of the 
        biography and presenting them as "fact."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On Logue's behalf 
        one could argue that since the publication of <i>Becoming Modern</i> Mina 
        Loy's life has entered the public domain. Judging by the stares of nonrecognition 
        that still greet me in bookshops, however, such a claim is misleading. 
        When I began work on the biography twenty years ago, she had been so thoroughly 
        forgotten that most people thought I was writing about the film star. 
        Since its publication critics have recognized <i>Becoming Modern</i> as 
        the definitive work on Loy. As such it has a different status from lives 
        of figures like Gertrude Stein, Hemingway, or Pound, about whom new biographies 
        are written every decade: for this reason Logue's appropriations are all 
        the more salient. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Moreover, although 
        she does credit <i>Becoming Modern</i> as one of two outstanding sources," 
        this acknowledgement is misleading. It suggests only a partial recognition 
        of a much greater indebtedness and could be thought to imply some form 
        of cooperation on my part. While Logue appears to have done no original 
        research into the life of Mina Loy, relying entirely upon the biography, 
        I was never asked to lend my support to her project.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Excerpts from recent 
        reviews of <i>Shadow-Box</i> demonstrate the extent and nature of the 
        appropriations:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">thematic: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">-- the biography's 
        major themes reappear as those of the novel: "the conflicting forces at 
        work in the first decades of the century; the dynamism and energy of new 
        movements in art and thought, as opposed to the left-over Victorian propriety 
        that traps the talented, intelligent Mina in an early loveless marriage; 
        forward-looking New York, where her first poems are published and appreciated, 
        versus stuck-in-the-past Europe" (<i>Literary Review</i>)</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        cultural milieux &amp; forms: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        -- While the biography is what made it possible for Logue to evoke the 
        lively artistic backgrounds, from Post-Impressionism to Futurism and Dada, 
        not to mention Loy's lovers and friends like Marinetti, Duchamp, and Picabia, 
        she is credited with original portrayals of "the intellectual excitement 
        and controversy surrounding the arts in the pre-WWI period," even with 
        creating "witty and illuminating" glimpses of the period's luminaries 
        (<i>Kirkus</i>)--the details of which derive from my treatment of these 
        movements and figures some uses of specific details, settings, and structures:</font></p>

        to these uses of my biography, it is for someone else to judge <i>Shadow-Box</i>. 
        Others will decide whether it transforms the biographical materials or 
        whether it remains a derivative work.</font> 
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It would also be 
        instructive to compare Logue's novel with Albert Guerard's<i>The Hotel 
        in the Jungle</i> (Baskerville, 1996), a work of imaginative fiction composed 
        before my book appeared and based on what was then known of the Loy/Cravan 
        story. Guerard made the legend his own by creating a setting for their 
        romance (the hotel) and a group of characters who retrospectively piece 
        together their story.</font> 
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While it is a pleasure 
        to see novelists' creative transformations of historical material (and 
        there are many successful examples), Logue's raises serious questions 
        about literary method and publishing ethics. <i>Caveat lector!</i></font>
