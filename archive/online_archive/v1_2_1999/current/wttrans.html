However, it is </NOBR><BR><NOBR>this impossibility </NOBR><BR><NOBR>that I intend to examine. That is, the poetic space which intentionally displays itself as </NOBR><BR><NOBR>unreadable. </NOBR><BR><NOBR>I would like to explore what this <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=90>				unreadability </NOBR><BR><NOBR>implies </NOBR><BR><NOBR>for 					<IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=126>	the reader </NOBR><BR><NOBR>and under what conditions does a poetry like Cole's lend itself to defy the perhaps naive or  </NOBR><BR><NOBR>canonical standards of </NOBR><BR><NOBR>readability. </NOBR><BR><NOBR>This poetic inaccessibility underscores the process through which meaning is conveyed: in  </NOBR><BR><NOBR>other words, the process of reading. </NOBR><BR><NOBR>After all, what does it mean to read and to be read? </NOBR><BR><NOBR>The act of reading is a heavily connotative act for it implies that a reader u n d e r s t a n d s  </NOBR><BR><NOBR>under what genre or category to place what is before him or her. If I call Cole's work p-o-e-t- </NOBR><BR><NOBR>r-y then I will read it accordingly, which is perhaps why her visual construction of words  </NOBR><BR><NOBR>and her use of language itself seem to be </NOBR><BR><NOBR>unreadable. </NOBR><BR><NOBR>The condition of 					<IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=126>mis  <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=9>  reading </NOBR><BR><NOBR>is what is most compelling about experimental or avant garde art and writings. The mis </NOBR><BR><NOBR>comprehension of a text, if addressed, leads one to think about what it means to read, to see,  </NOBR><BR><NOBR>to acquire meaning. Ultimately, mis </NOBR><BR><NOBR>comprehension leads one to reassess how a text is being constructed; it brings one to a  </NOBR><BR><NOBR>Brechtian distanciation from the text where one can then </NOBR><BR><NOBR>rethink how meaning is being performed by language </NOBR><BR><NOBR>and how, subsequently, </NOBR><BR><NOBR> </NOBR><BR><NOBR>the reading subject is also being performed by language. </NOBR><BR><NOBR> </NOBR><BR><NOBR>		<IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=54>Space is something that I do not see as a neutral abstraction that is </NOBR><BR><NOBR>"a-logical" and "without explanation," as one critic writes of Mallarm&eacute;.  Space  </NOBR><BR><NOBR>could not be more political: it is the primary field upon which all order is imposed  </NOBR><BR><NOBR>and subsequently conceived.  </NOBR><BR><NOBR> </NOBR><BR><NOBR><IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=54>false topography reflecting different intentions </NOBR><BR><NOBR><IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=54>and starving </NOBR><BR><NOBR><IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=54>both sides of the page at the same time<BR><IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=134><FONT FACE="Palatino" SIZE=2>Norma Cole<I> Paper House</I></FONT> </NOBR><BR><NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      Space is what dictates relationships and <BR>      <NOBR> associations in every circumstance: </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> it is the visual plane that structures meaning. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Space is only a universal phenomenon </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> insofar as it is greatly relevant for </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> every artwork, genre, city, country, and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> increasingly, for the global community. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Space defines how a subject maps his or herself </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> in relation to the outside world and subse </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> quently how that subject understands his or her </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> inside world. Space constructs the inside/outside </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> dynamic that is neither culturally un </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> iversal nor absolute. To misread a </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> text such as one of Cole's is to become de-centered, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> de-stabilized, to experience a sort of violence because of it utilization       of space. To </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> misread is also to become dislocated in space. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>My thesis will explore through Cole's       poetry and other primary sources the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> translation of space(s). Using Henri Lefevbre's <U>The Production       of Space</U> and Teresa de </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Lauretis's <U>Alice Doesn't: Feminism, Semiotics, and Cinema</U>,       among other texts, I will stage </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the conflict between the homogenous representational space of ideology       (Lefevbre) and the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> heterogenous spaces that are unaccounted for by ideology (de Lauretis)       and how this </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> conflict is manifest in Cole's poetry. It is this moment of conflict       that is pertinent to the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> phenomenon of misreading. What misreading implies is that a reading       subject is </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> experiencing a mis-identification with what is being read, either       because s-he as a reading </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> subject is not written into the text or because the text purposely       writes its own misreading. In </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> this sense, the position of mis-identification can be one of empowerment,       especially where </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> ideology is concerned. Mis-identification reveals the presence of       a dialogic, an active almost </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> aggressive interaction between a reader and a text, in which the       result, as Judith Butler </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> writes in "Sex/Gender/Desire," "may entail acceptance of divergence,       breakage, splinter, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> and fragmentation"(14-5). </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>In <U>The Production of Space</U>, Henri       Lefevbre shows how space is a production of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> ideology, how the very basic and often times unacknowledged factor       of space, that in which </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> we live (absolute space) and that in which we think (abstract space),       is a pervasive and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> powerful structuring force. However, he also points out that space       is not homogenous, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> meaning, we do not all live and experience our spaces in the same       way, but that space is </NOBR><BR>      represented as homogenous. Similarly, in <U>Alice Doesn't: Feminism, Semiotics,       and <BR>      Cinema</U>, Teresa de Lauretis argues that "semantic fields" or "non-linear       semantic spaces" <BR>      <NOBR> are not constructed by a one system language but "by the multilevel       interactions of many </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> heterogeneous sign-vehicles and cultural units"(35). This is to say       that language and space </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> are neither universal nor linear, although they both are represented       as such by ideology. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> The crucial factor that is often unacknowledged by ideology is that       identity, unlike its </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> representations of homogeneous space, is not a stable or conclusive       unit. On the contrary, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> identity is replete with often times contradictory elements that       can neither be totally </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> fulfilled nor completely accounted for. In other words, the moment       of conflict that I have </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> described as instigating a subject's mis-identification also includes       the conflict between </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> his/her social and personal histories. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> It is in this sense that I would like to examine how space, both       the spaces </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> within and outside of the text, function in Cole's poetry. I will       explore the cinematic, </NOBR><BR>      the poetic...[and finish with a discussion of the ever more pertinent topic       of cyberspace--<I>not <BR>      included here</I>.

Eventually, I found that I could locate </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> it in many spaces. Although not all of them "literary," I have </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> found it crucial to branch out into other disciplines such </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> as architecture and film in order to effectively create the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> foundation for an analysis of Cole's poetry. As a </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Comparative Literature thesis, this work seeks to explore </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the relationships that exist between disciplines and by </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> doing so argue that the finite distinction between them is no </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> longer relevant. (I do not mean to imply that the disciplines are       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> irrelevant, but that the boundaries separating them are). Architectural       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> theory may be just as appropriate for a discussion of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> poetry as one of poetry may be for architecture. In the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> introduction of his book, <U>Architecture and Disjunction</U>, Bernard       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Tschumi argues that his use of theory from disciplines </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> such as film and literature in his discussions about architecture       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> is necessitated by the fact that any cause-and-effect </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> relationship between form, use function, and socio-economic </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> structure has become both impossible and obsolete (4). This </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> phenomenon can be said to be the result of a postmodern </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> culture that perhaps is best characterized as a culture </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> of representation in which "authenticity" has been supplanted </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> by the simulacrum. Despite the array of definitions, (or non-definitions),       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> that surround Postmodernism, it, as a theory of culture that includes       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> theories of the media, cyberspace or otherwise, foregrounds </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the importance of the visual for late twentieth century Western European       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> culture. What the numerous arguments surrounding Postmodernisms </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> show is how much this period is concerned with </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> crisis, whether it be the crisis of the subject, the crisis </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> of meaning, the crisis of captialism, of authority, etc. In the late       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> twentieth century, nothing seems to be real, everything </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> is a simulation of difference, an image of an image. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>According to Lefevbre, the visual is       that which </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> represents: "in space, things, acts, situations are forever </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> being replaced by representations. The Ego no longer relates </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> to its own nature but only to things bound to their own signs </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> and indeed ousted and supplanted by them" (311). </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> The visual, the fragmentation or dissolution of boundaries </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> between various genres and the crisis of the subject are </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> all very pertinent to not only Cole's poetry, but to my </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> discussion of it. Writing about writing, about poetry, is as </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> much about the poetry as it is about the writing itself. The goal       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> of my thesis is not only to analyse and interpret Cole's poetry,       but </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> also to explore what it means for me to write about it. In </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <U>Woman Native Other</U>, Trinh Min-ha states that "to write is       to </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> become. Not to become a writer (or a poet), but to become, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> intransitively"(19). The idea that writing is intransiate, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> is constantly in the process of becoming, is something that is </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> integral to Cole's poetry and to my understanding of it. To conceive       of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> writing as process, as a continually forming and reforming act without       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> conclusion is to not only recognize the inconclusiveness of language,       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> but also to recognize that this inconclusiveness contributes to the       argument </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> that there is no one language through which meaning is conveyed.       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>It is significant that both Roland Barthes       and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Jacques Derrida have focused on the crisis of criticism when </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> confronted with avantgarde or difficult writings. In <U>S/Z</U>,       Barthes </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> writes that "to interpret a text is not to give it a meaning, but       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> on the contrary to appreciate what plurality constitutes it"(5).       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> However, Barthes also writes that the work of the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> commentary, once it is separated from any ideology of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> totality, consists precisely in "manhandling the text, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> interrupting it"(15). This manhandling is precisely what </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> I will inevitably do. Nevertheless, I do not necessarily </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> agree with Barthes's description of manipulating a text, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> because it does not acknowledge the general crisis of criticism </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> that difficult writing inspires. For his part, Derrida, explains       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> that for rhetoric or criticism to have something to do before a text,       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> a meaning has to be determinable (114). However, in referring </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> to Mallarm&eacute;'s writing, Derrida illustrates that when a simple       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> decision is no longer possible for the critic or the reader, the       choice </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> between opposing paths is suspended. This suspension instigates a       crisis </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> of criticism that obstructs the critic's ability to decide on a meaning.       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> As for my thesis, the non-traditional handling of a poet and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> her poetry is all perhaps in recognition of the crisis of criticism       and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the intransience of writing, both of which are essential components       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> of Cole's poetry and of the act of reading and writing about it.       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR>       <HR>      </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20> In creating a visual poetry, (a poetry       that utilizes movement much like cinematic </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> images do, which through their movement on the screen, create a narrative,       or, in some </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> cases, a non-narrative), the way in which the words function upon       the blank space of the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> page becomes essential. In <I>Memory Shack</I>, a poem from <U>Moira</U>,       Cole cites the reader as a </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> spectator: "a string shadow or space / the spectator is alive / as       a messy site" (20). Words </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> understood visually on the page can become much more then signifiers       that are locked </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> onto a specific manner of signification, but they can, like images,       move on the page creating </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> multiple readings, readings that are both visual and connotative.       In his essay on Mallarm&eacute;, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Derrida describes this phenomenon as <I>&eacute;criture</I>: </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>"the marks and white spaces on the page       [which] are only one realization of the articulations and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>systems of difference upon which the       operations of significations rely and which prevent signification </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>from ever closing on itself or on the       world." (7) </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> &Eacute;criture is language that understands or includes the spaces       that already exist in language; </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> &Eacute;criture is about writing the spaces back into language, exposing       the systems of difference </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> that make up language. However, unlike images, words are classically       understood to </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> function not in a pictoral or visual manner, but in a stricly signifying       sense. Words are, in a </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> way, locked into the manner in which they are supposed to be read.       In a fax that I received </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> from Norma Cole, where she refers to her recent struggle with an       editor concerning the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> layout of some of her poetry, she writes: </NOBR><br>      <BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>The titles of these poems are sometimes       onomastic in their function, sometimes like introductory or </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>prestanzic, or, in some cases, want to       be read into the first lines of the text, as text. Such relationships are       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>crucial to the work and to one's reading       of it. How this exploration, with its provocations, moves toward </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>resolution, or new forms, reveals itslef       in the more recent work, where there are not titles in the sense of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>separators, where the text moves along       with small breaks as a serial piece, and where its visual texture in </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>the page might be experienced as ..<B>.BLACK       AND WHITE FILM MOVING THROUGH A PROJECTOR</B>, a </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>composition of light and dark that is       constantly shape-shifting.8 </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> &Eacute;criture, writing that formally situates itself in the visual,       alters the reading experience. For </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Derrida, the advent of<I> &eacute;criture</I> marks the end of literature       as classically understood. It </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> marks a crisis of meaning because the realm of language has shifted       to include itself so that </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the "semantic fields" and the "non-linear semantic spaces" of language,       about which de </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Lauretis writes, become implicated in the writing itself. In other       words, the apparatus is </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> exposed. The inside of writing is no longer insular, but open to       the confluence and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> divergence of other languages or sign systems. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>It is interesting that once a poetry       decides to create "new forms," it begins to reference </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> other medias. A poetry that is visual, that is exploring the visual       and seeking to create the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> space for other reading experiences, becomes a poetry that feels       "cinematic" </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> "architectural,"or "textural." It also becomes a poetry that can       no longer be read as </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> "poetry;" it becomes a poetry that entices misreadings, that runs       over the poetic parameters </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> of stanza, verse, rhyme and rather then evoke readings, evokes experiences       of readings. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> The poetry becomes writerly rather than readerly, to use Roland Barthes's       distinction. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR>       <HR>      </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>Misreadings, in their renaming or re-experiencing       of images or words, can ostensibly </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> create the space(s) in which seemingly homogenous meaning and experience       can radically </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> be undermined. Misreading can bring to the surface differences that       are hidden by ideology </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> and consequently underscore transparency as the artifice that it       is. It is my argument that </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> radical poetry such as Cole's constitutes a remapping of meaning       as plural and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> inconclusive, as open and therefore always subject to change, as       above all heterogeneous. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> However, this remapping entails a certain condition of being lost,       of accepting the horror of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> being lost. Really, it entails nothing other than what is already       there. But to foreground it, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> to make this the ground from which to work, is to not only defy certain       standards of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> readability, it is to create a space of destitution with which the       reader and writer are </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> confronted. The reader can no longer be a passive spectator expecting       a condition of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> meaning that is predetermined and hence readable, but the reader       must learn to reread the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> spaces in which meaning is formed and therefore reread new spaces       in which new forms </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> and or meanings can be created. The reader must examine the power       relations that make </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> certain dialogics possible and perhaps question these dialogics in       the hopes for new ones. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR>       <HR>      </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Poetic Space: Paper House</NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=90>"moving about in worlds not realized"</NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=216>- Norma Cole <I>Paper House </I></NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Paper House - space of violence, space of destitution. House of a       book made of paper, paper </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> housing spaces, spaces inhabiting the house of paper. Paper House       a space of fraility where </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the structures are showing through the decor. The House threatens       to fall, to cease being </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the protective structure that it is desired to be. A House is a space       of shelter, one that like </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the apparatus seeks to veil all signs of turmoil from both the inside       and the outside. Once </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the structures are bare then the inside and outside are no longer       protected from each other. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> The outside can see in and the inside can see out but be seen by       the outside seeing. A Paper </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> House is one that does not promise shelter. It promises transparency,       not the transparency </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> of meaning, but the transparency of structure. The apparatus is thus       seen as structure that is </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> structuring the internal and external spaces. The idea of the Paper       House indicates the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> importance of the boundaries that separate the inside from the outside.       This distinction is </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> one of the fundamental bases for our understanding of our world;       it allows us private and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> public space divisions. It attributes to our understanding of our       bodies and their relation to </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the space that they inhabit and are subsequently framed by. If this       division is weakened </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> then bodies are exposed, violence is exposed, the boundary between       private and public </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> space is eradicated. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>The notion of the House functions on       various levels in Cole's poem. It is that in </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> which we live and that with which we speak. It is a structure, symbolic       of the apparatus of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> language, symbolic of the nation. The House structures us, it defines       our notions of the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> spaces in which we live. In <u>The Politics of Poetic Form</U>, Bruce       Andrews writes that political </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> or "radical" writing "reads the outside, it doesn't just read itself"       (24). In many ways, the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> House is the boundary marker between inside and outside space or       between private and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> public space. A Paper House is a visual manifestation of language.       It is the walls, the floor, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the doors that we shut, for without language they all disappear.       The House reveals the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> architectural importance of space and of language. It is a rudimentary       structure like that of </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the alphabet which structures Cole's poem. The House reads the outside       because it defines </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> it. Similarly, Cole's poem reads the outside because it reveals it.       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>The form of <i>Paper House</i> incites       many issues concerning the structure of language in </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> poetry. There is indeed a poetic architecture that constructs how       a poem can be read. Be it </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> stanza, verse, fragmentary form, the architecture of words builds       the walls of the poem, or, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> in this case, takes those walls apart. Cole's poem is divided into       twenty five small poems, </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> one for each letter of the alphabet except for y and z. Almost instinctively,       one looks for the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> logical correspondance between each letter and its poem finding that       the connection, if </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> there is one, is not obvious, perhaps is not even there. Under the       seemingly elemental </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> structure of language, the alphabet, there lies a heavy and complex       network of signs and </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> meanings that pull with it numerous histories of memory, experience       and violence. That </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> the poetry consists of the same letters as the simply laid out alphabet       reveals the inherent </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> inconsistencies within language. Which is to say that the process       by which meaning is </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> conveyed and constructed is neither linear or clearly maintained:       there is always a certain </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> violence inherent to the act. In poem "d" of <I>Paper House</I>,       Cole writes: </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=54>why does it turn to me, a reductive story       all white, all red </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=90>I'll jump into the sea </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=54>dig a hole with both arms, bury eyes       in it </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=54>a nation that apologizes to its war dead,       securing the chain </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=90>that binds both arms </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR></font>       <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><FONT FACE="Palatino"><nobr>(excerpts from a Senior Thesis, 1998) </nobr><BR>        </font></p>      <FONT FACE="Palatino"><NOBR>       <HR>      </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> WORKING NOTE: Wendy Tronrud </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Throughout the process of writing my thesis, I have been constantly       asking myself </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> why is space important, why is poetry important, and why is it important       that I am writing </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> my thesis on them both? To a certain degree, it is easy to throw       around theories about </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> gender, the crisis of meaning, the crisis of the subject and so forth,       without recognizing the </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> important role that theory, art, literature, poetry, architecture,       etc., play in actively shaping </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> our conceptions of the spaces in which we exist and subsequently       the ways in which we </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> define ourselves and others. It seems like such an inconsequential       thing to write a thesis on </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> an avant-garde poet and admittedly it is. At least, to a certain       extent. Who reads Norma </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Cole anyway? Certainly not academia. Certainly not the general public.       Whoever that is. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Her poetry is difficult. A difficulty, however, that must both be       understood in relation to its </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> opposite and in relation to a specific historical moment that happens       to discourage </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> difficulty. At least at the level of the arts. A difficultly that       must be examined in order to </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> ascertain why it is that it is named difficult and why it is that       clarity is important to begin </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> with. Clarity, as does everything, has a price and that price is       arguably paid for by those who </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> are excluded from the vision / representation that defines it/. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <IMG SRC="0.gif"  HSPACE=20>I began my thesis with a simple statement:       I do not understand Norma Cole's poetry. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> What this means exactly is, of course, unknowable, but what this       means for me to say it is </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> that I freed myself from the responsibility to have to know something       enough to write </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> about it. This confession has, ultimately, enabled me to write. And       as it has enabled me to </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> write, it has enabled me to write "intransitively," as Trinh T. Minh-ha       says. To move in </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> different spaces and to rethink the spaces with which I thought I       was already familiar. </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> <B>Bio</B>: Wendy Tronrud has recently finished her B.A. degree in       Comparative Literature at </NOBR><BR>      <NOBR> Barnard College of Columbia University.
