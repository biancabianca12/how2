It looks at women artists working with<BR>the animal, the beast and related imagery.  It cites Marina Warner's _From<BR>the Beast to the Blonde_, which has become an important reference text for<BR>women poets too.  I particularly liked a feminist critique of the<BR>animal-becomings in "A Thousand Plateaux: Capitalism and Schizophrenia" by <BR>Deleuze and Guattari. There is also a review of <I>Diva: the Video<BR>Installation</I> by Fabienne Auteoud.<BR>      -- Frances Presley<BR><BR><BR>      <B><i>Fragmente: Psychoanalysis and Poetics</i>, edited by D.S. Marriott       & Vicky<BR>Lebeau, no.  8, Summer 1998.</B><BR><BR>This special issue tends to assume, in some of its articles, a rather<BR>specialist knowledge of psychoanalytic theory.  It includes an article by<BR>Vicky Lebeau on "Clinical Poetics" which looks again at Freud's analysis of<BR>the dream of Irma's injection.  Irma was the patient who suffered from<BR>hysterical choking and was unable to open her mouth properly.  There is<BR>also an article by Suzanne Raitt: "Love in the time of Lacan"--the poetry of<BR>Veronica Forrest-Thomson.  In both writers Raitt finds a subject impossibly<BR>dispersed by the operation of the signifying order in which it must,<BR>somehow, find its being; but also of a subject which is inconceivable<BR>except as an effect of desire.  Also of interest for women experimental<BR>poets is Anthony Mellors' thorough-going attack on Charles Olson's phallic<BR>mysticism.  There are two poems by Marjorie Welish in this issue.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    <BR>      -- F.P.<BR><BR><BR>      <B>Claudia Rankine, <u>The End of the Alphabet</u>, Grove/Atlantic.</B><BR><BR>A series of extended meditations--fragmented, impressionistic, often<BR>elegiac, both lyrical and resistant.  Rankine's writing is incredibly<BR>      evocative of mood & situation, even as it completely eschews narrative structures.<br>      <BR>      -- Elisabeth Frost<BR><BR><BR>      <B>Deanne Lundin, <u>The Ginseng Hunter's Notebook</u>, New Issues (forthcoming,<BR>April)</B><BR><BR>This is a collection of often interlinked poems, some very visual in form &<BR>others more traditionally formal, exploring questions of knowledge,<BR>history, & the nature of healing, both modern & ancient.  They're poems<BR>that take leaps & seek, I think, to reinvent the lyric in new forms.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    <BR>      -- E.F.<BR><BR><HR><FONT FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="index.html">go to this issue's table of contents</A><HR></font></font><p><FONT FACE="Palatino">  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../../../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object>  <FONT FACE="Palatino"></font></font></p></td></TR></table></BODY></HTML>
