This is a daunting and overwhelming question, one which         many others could answer better than I. Since I've been invited to speak         on this question, I'll do my best by beginning with a story (a long-winded         anecdote really, but not such a bad story after all), of one San Francisco&#146;s         Bay Area publishing dramas by the name of <i>Idiom</i> (http://www.idiomart.com).         In this story I will sketch a romance of the mid-1990s avant-garde, including         the seduction of the young by utopian ambitions; their awakening to the         logistical, fiscal, and temporal realities of the publishing world; and         their eventual exploitation of and counter-exploitation by the altered         reading habits and new technologies of virtual late capitalism. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The <i>Idiom</i>         publishing collective began around 1994. Its half a dozen or so editors         were intelligent, well-meaning young people who had newly discovered in         themselves certain ideals about poetry. Many of us had met as students         at Berkeley where we had been influenced by developments inspired by Language         Poetry and the New York School, as well as revisions of canonical authorship,         criticism and art. We were also interested in collective organizing, coterie         movements for mutual support and promotion, and a model of literary activity         more akin to the tradition of the artists' salon than that of the lonely         author. We were swept away by the plethora of what we perceived to be         exciting, innovative work happening around us&#150;work by many fine verse         and prose writers who had been practicing in the Bay Area since the 70s         and 80s, as well as work by emerging young writers whose poetics and even         aesthetics were as yet unarticulated. Some of these emerging writers,         still in their early twenties, harbored "heroic" notions of poethood,         but we were confident that many of them could be nudged in a more provocative,         radically explorative, and tonally adventurous direction. We hoped that         this would occur partly by their engagement with <i>Idiom</i>, which (while         yet to assume material reality) would through its reckless enthusiasm         and charming ways hopefully foster significant discussions and works of         the next wave. To this end a reading series was organized, placing in         dialogue the works of more established writers with those of the emerging         generation. This was delivered before a semi-informal audience composed         of listeners from both these groups and others. Serious thought was also         given toward a mode of publishing which might provisionally represent         the community of emergent writers from an area including Oakland, Berkeley,         and the San Francisco Bay region. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;There was an         abundance of inspired past examples. We were drawn in particular to the         chapbook series of Burning Deck and Tuumba, finding in their spare designs         and expansive range of titles, an ethos of budget-conscious book circulation         whose momentum and artistic currency we desired to emulate. We also admired         and were stirred to action by the go-getting East Coast productions of         <i>O-blek</i> and Leave Books. They provided standards of diligence, widespread         circulation, and critical scope which we felt certain would emerge any         day without warning among the twentysomethings of the opposite coast.         On the other hand, the journal, <i>Proliferation</i>&#150;with its cumulative         insanity of erratic paper stock, illegible marginalia, diecut covers,         postfeminist typesetting, and anachronistic letterpress prints wedded         to toner-crazy photocopier ejectorama&#150;deeply influenced our inchoate         attraction to impracticably elaborate, fiscally draining design schemes,         fetishistic juxtapositioning of textures, and nonstandard book elements.         <i>Proliferation </i>introduced us to the idea of design as the signature         of publishing, of content as an extension of excessive and excessively         signifying media. Thus our personalities found confirmation, and we soon         abandoned efficiency in favor of the baroque as our primary mode of functioning.         It soon became not only necessary, but a principle of pride for us, to         reinvent the wheel with each new chapbook project. Four years and six         chapbooks later, we are veterans of desktop publishing and the scrap heap.         We have developed enduring intimacies with paper cutters, letterpress         ink rollers, hand stitching, woodblock prints, silkscreening, the zen         of saddle stapling, docutech printing, permanent markers, velvet, acetate         plastic, xacto knives, high-volume Costco film processing, office resource         embezzlement, Federal Express envelopes, and a particularly beautiful         silver can of almond-scented Italian archival paste. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In addition to         the chapbook series, we lumbered characteristically toward the development         of an online journal. This would feature the emergent Bay Area writing         which we had originally solicited over many years and planned to feature         in the inaugural issue of a massive print journal (also to go by the name         of <i>Idiom</i>). By our perpetually preliminary estimates, this print         journal would consist of two hundred perfectbound pages of new writing,         along with visual art reproductions and book reviews, to be paid for with         the nonexistent revenue we felt for sure would be earned by our reading         and chapbook series. Needless to say, the print product never surfaced.         Instead, we shifted our focus to producing a quarterly journal on the         Web, which enabled us to bypass the formidable costs of offset printing         and to churn out virtual publications at a slightly less slow pace. We         discovered several advantages and idiosyncrasies of our new medium. One         advantage was that it was suddenly possible to achieve international circulation         in a utopic sense, at no extra cost to us. Another was the relative ease         and fidelity of reproducing full-color visual art, especially art dealing         with themes of visual textuality. It occurred to us that the limitations         of print publication did not have to be paralleled onscreen. By reproducing         multiple views of an artpiece, for example, we were able to create a kind         of virtual gallery experience, and to make accessible to the public work         which had previously been viewable only in the rare original. Yet another         advantage was the ability to present in website form the <i>Idiom</i>         project in its entirety. Quarterly issues could deal with special topics,         and also interact with promotions for the print chapbook series. The <i>Idiom</i>         project as a whole could exist as a coherent archive, growing bit by bit         by accretion rather than replacement. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;We also discovered         that our electronic existence placed us squarely in a new community of         readers who had developed reading habits peculiar to the Internet. In         particular, we found ourselves part of a reading experience situated largely         and furtively in the gaps between official, corporate or institutionally         sanctioned uses of computer technology. We became part of a model of poetry         that was exactly the opposite of pulling a book down from a shelf and         reading it leisurely. Rather, we thrived on the culture of email breaks,         procrastination, and clandestine browsing which had evolved to make the         white-collar workday bearable on a minute-to-minute level by undermining         its file-o-fax narrative of efficient productivity. We capitalized on         the fidgety down time of working poets and readers, and our survival was         in turn ensured by the workplace&#150;by the innocuous and officiously         anonymous guise of the computer monitor and by our own resourceful pillaging         of the lush resources and equipment of one of Silicon Valley's corporate         giants of desktop publishing. All of this typing and double-clicking helped         to promote the appearance of increasing third-quarter earnings, when in         fact it was only poetry which benefited from this balance of labor. Thus         a sub-narrative of art found itself sponsored by the reported narrative         of industry. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;And so our story         pauses here in midswing. We continue to champion idleness in the face         of maximal productivity, and California-style lassitude in a culture of         accelerating deadlines, compulsory day care, and declining sleep hours,         in which even poets are not exempt from the vicissitudes and demands of         the rat race. In particular, one might consider how the "SuperMom" paradigm         of the 1980s and 90s has worked its way into the world of today's working         writer or artist. In place of or in addition to "family," substitute "poetry"         or "publishing" as the surplus yet essential term which must somehow be         squeezed into a cramped schedule of high-tuition, debt-inducing classes;         increasingly competitive and high-pressure academic careers; longer workdays;         and long commute hours from culture-rich urban centers to job-rich exurbias.         Fortunately, others more stout of heart and better organized than <i>Idiom</i>         have moved in to wrangle the scene. Presses and journals like <i>Explosive         Magazine</i> and Spectacular Books, Melodeon Poetry Systems, ghost-i,         <i>Tripwire</i>, <i>Shark</i>, <i>Krupskaya</i>, <i>Interlope</i>, <i>Lipstick</i><u>         </u><i>Eleven</i>, Double Lucy Books, Second Story, and <i>Log</i>, to         name a few, are keeping bookshelves stocked with the latest new writing         and manuscripts of our generation. It is to them that we look, eagerly         and expectantly, for what looms on the horizon.</font><font face="Palatino">         </font></p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="148" height="199" valign="top"></td>    <td width="4" height="199" valign="top"></td>    <td width="465" height="199" colspan="7" valign="top"><font face="Times">       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#top">(back         to top)</a></font> </p>      </font>       <p>       <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BIO:</b> Pamela         Lu was born in Southern California and studied mathematics at the University         of California, Berkeley.
