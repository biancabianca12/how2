It occurred to her then that she             wanted to try to get that degenerating syntax into a poem, even though             the great poems she&#146;d been assigned didn&#146;t read like that.             She had no idea how she would locate such a counterpoint on the page,             but understood that <u>her</u> interior soundtrack while shaped by             system was not systematic...but interested her for its unacknowledged             music.

It simply needs time enough for dissatisfaction to         erupt and a poet of sufficient inventiveness to give it voice. Its propelling         impulse has been essential to twentieth-century American prosody. We find         it profoundly illustrated in Charles Olson&#146;s 1950 manifesto, &quot;Projective         Verse&quot; (Allen 1960, 386) where he articulates his physical inability         to <u>fit</u> into the inherited forms of &quot;closed&quot; verse. While         those forms have inspired other writers, they have not proved to be expansive         enough for his own body, his own breath--the energy field that propels         his language. He <u>must</u> break all visible and invisible restraints         and invent a page--a &quot;field&quot;--in which his line, his spoken         &quot;energy discharge,&quot; can &quot;declare for itself.&quot; Reading         his essay in the Sixties and reading it now, one is forcibly struck by         Olson&#146;s ability to listen, recognize and insist upon the efficacy         and necessity of inventing an entirely new system for thinking about language         composition. One sees how his concept--so urgently proposed--released         immense amounts of poetic energy and invention in his peers, Robert Duncan         and Robert Creeley, and in many poets of succeeding generations, each         of whom, while developing a unique tonality, proposed (in certain of their         own poems) a reading of the page&#146;s visual potential and syllabic         particularity as demonstrated by Olson.&#9;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Almost every         great poet has needed to resist the law-abidingness and administrative         presence of the superintendant and the foreman, even if the act of resistance         is unheralded by theoretical preface. Even the most playful exorcising         of grammar and syntax should not be underestimated as a repudiation of         traditional guardianship--the refusal of sterile ground--as Stein so steadily         demonstrated.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;But it <i>does         not matter</i> to the poet who is just coming into a mature understanding         of writing that others have preceded her in their practice of </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">the continuous present,         stream of consciousness, field composition and other named forms of disruptive         polyphony. These stand as important companions in the formal recognition         of devolutionary necessity.
