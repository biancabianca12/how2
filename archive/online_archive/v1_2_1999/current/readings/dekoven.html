Though she was contemporaneous with modernism, and helped to         engender it in <i>Three Lives</i>, and though there are many points of         intersection between her work and modernism, particularly in her poetics,         her work is eccentric to the mainstream of modernism. A comparison of         her work to fiction that is indisputably modernist makes this liminality         apparent, and in doing so reveals as much about what modernism is as about         what, in Stein, it is not.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In December,         1991, I presented a version of this essay at the MLA meeting of the James         Joyce Society, a panel entitled "Joyce, Stein, Woolf, Richardson." My         first association with that panel title had been the Sesame Street jingle,         "one of these is not like the others, one of these just doesn't belong,         can you guess which one is not like the others by the time we finish this         song." On a number of counts, Gertrude Stein is the one that just doesn't         belong, and the fact that her name is not associated with the term stream-of-consciousness         may be the least interesting of those counts.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Different as         Joyce, Woolf and Richardson are, the simple statement can be made that         they are all modernist novelists. In engendering modernism, in their early         works, they rewrote the rules for fiction. Joyce, in <i>Ulysses</i> and         especially <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, and to a lesser extent Woolf in <i>The         Waves</i>, went on to push the novel to and perhaps beyond its limits.         But they still, deeply and meaningfully, worked in relation to the history         of the novel, including the history which both of them, and Richardson         as well, had already remade. Throughout her various phases of narrative         writing, Stein was responding to a different set of concerns.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In an interview         she gave near the end of her life, Stein said "You see it is the people         who generally smell of the museums who are accepted, and it is the new         who are not accepted. You have got to accept a complete difference. It         is hard to accept that, it is much easier to have one hand in the past.         That is why James Joyce was accepted and I was not. He leaned toward the         past, in my work the newness and difference is fundamental" (<i>Transatlantic         Interview</i> 29). "The smell of the museums" is at least in part the         smell of sour grapes, and postmodernism has deconstructed Stein's simple         modernist valorization of "newness" and "difference." Those qualifications         aside, however, and reading Stein somewhat against the grain, the issues         of "past" and "present" are crucial to understanding the distinction I         want to make between Joyce's, Woolf's or Richardson's modernist fiction         and Stein's experimentalist, avant-garde narrative.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Stein called         a number of her works "novels" (<i>A Novel of Thank You</i> is an even         more radically experimental text than <i>The Making of Americans</i>,         whose subtitle is <i>A Novel</i>) and even wrote some of them according         to the conventions for prose fiction--lines unbroken, consecutively numbered         chapters, named, described characters who act and speak. But her constructions         of narrative time, particularly her attempt to banish "memory" and to         articulate a "continuous present," where writing recreates itself anew         in each successive moment, made impossible the persistence through time         of a single universe of fictional material, however vast, diverse, and         shifting; a persistence upon which the novel depends.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In discussing         her attempt to write in the continuous present, Stein says "the making         of a portrait of any one is as they are existing and as they are existing         has nothing to do with remembering any one or anything" ("Portraits and         Repetition" 175). Her writing must always be in the present&#150;she must         write in each moment what she knows without allowing herself to remember         what she knew. She rejects the mimetic art of remembering, of the reproducible         and continuous, of knowledge that is converted into an artifact of itself.         Remembering invokes what Stein considers the nineteenth-century English         linear mode of successivity; she calls it elsewhere "beginning middle         and ending," and considers herself to have replaced it with the twentieth-century         American mode of simultaneity, a thing not accreted through time but composed         instantaneously of its various, interchangeable, equally important parts.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Stein's response         to the actual impossibility of banishing memory, of writing or living         in this idealist construction of a pure present, is to compare her work         to film, the twentieth-century genre par excellence. She says "Funnily         enough the cinema has offered a solution of this thing. By a continuously         moving picture of any one there is no memory of any other thing and there         is that thing existing" ("Portraits and Repetition" 176). Ironically,         film can be used to make just the opposite case: that "continuously moving         picture" depends entirely on memory and on successivity through diachronic         time for the impression of continuous movement that gives Stein the sense         of an absolute present and the abolition of memory. But the film analogy         can also be used to support Stein's argument in a crucial way, a way that         points to a radical difference between her narrative and the fiction of         Joyce, Woolf or Richardson.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The essay from         which I have been quoting, one of the <i>Lectures in America</i> called         "Portraits and Repetition," contains Stein's most useful discussion of         her particular deployment of a type of repetition she calls insistence.         The use of repetition in the service of a continuous present is a characteristic         Steinian paradox. Repetition would seem to depend utterly on memory. To         repeat is precisely to reproduce the past in the present. But Stein's         argument implies that it's the avoidance of repetition that links the         present to the past, through denial, or, as in the adage "those who forget         history are condemned to repeat it," through memory. A work that moves         successively through linear time changes in relation to its own past.         But the kind of steadily shifting repetition Stein calls insistence, that         reinvents itself anew in each moment of narrative, is unaware of its past         and therefore free to repeat it. Insistence is never verbatim repetition,         rather it's a function of looking at the same thing in a different present         moment, in which, if it is alive, the thing looked at has minutely changed.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The useful film         analogy is not to the overall impact of "no memory of any other thing"         that Stein describes in "Portraits and Repetition," but to the film strip         itself, in which each frame largely repeats but slightly shifts the frame         before it. Each frame is a new picture shot in the present moment, and         therefore it is different from the one before because each present moment         is different from the one before, but, when the camera has remained focused         on the same thing, each frame largely repeats the one before. So, repetition,         which seems to presuppose memory, can in fact negate it. In the Steinian         continuous present, the shifting repetition of insistence is inevitable         because you rediscover and reinvent in each moment what you know. If you         knew you'd already known it you wouldn't have to say it again.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The purest form         of Steinian insistence comes in the narrative writing she did between         1906 and 1912, or <i>Three Lives</i> and <i>Tender Buttons</i>, a six         year period in which she wrote shorter, longer, and much longer narratives,         including <i>The Making of Americans</i>, <i>Matisse</i>, <i>Picasso and         Gertrude Stein</i> otherwise known as <i>GMP</i>, <i>A Long Gay Book</i>,         and <i>Many Many Women</i>. Stein's style changed radically during the         course of this period, from the style I call insistence to what became         the style of <i>Tender Buttons</i>, the style I call lively words. Lively         words is as different from insistence as two kinds of writing by the same         person can be. I can't think of another writer whose work diverged so         drastically and totally from its own past in such a short time. The best         analogy that comes to mind is, not surprisingly, the difference between         Picasso's blue period and his so-called heroic cubism. This stylistic         shift happens for Stein <i>within</i> several of her long 1909-1912 narratives,         so that the end of <i>GMP</i> or <i>A Long Gay Book</i> is entirely unrecognizable         to its beginning. <i>A Long Gay Book</i>, for example, begins in characteristic         insistence:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;When they             are very little just only a baby you can never tell which one is to             be a lady.</font></p>          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;There are             some when they feel it inside them that it has been with them that             there was once so very little of them, that they were a baby, helpless             and no conscious feeling in them, that they knew nothing then when             they were kissed and dandled and fixed by others who knew them when             they could know nothing inside them or around them, some get from             all this that once surely happened to them to that which was then             every bit that was then them, there are some when they feel it later             inside them that they were such once and that was all that there was             then of them, there are some who have from such a knowing an uncertain             curious kind of feeling in them that their having been so little once             and knowing nothing makes it all a broken world for them that they             have inside them, kills for them the everlasting feeling; and they             spend their life in many ways, and always they are trying to make             for themselves a new everlasting feeling.(13)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The book ends in         pure lively words: "Lead kind in soap, lead kind in soap sew up. Lead         kind in so up. Lead kind in so up. Leaves a mass, so mean. No shows. Leaves         a mass cool will. Leaves a mass puddle. Etching. Etching a chief, none         plush" (116). All other obvious dissimilarities between both of these         styles and Joyce's or Woolf's aside, a more diametrical opposition to         the perfectly circular structure of <i>Finnegans Wake</i> or the implied         circular structure of <i>The Waves</i> I cannot imagine. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;<i>Ulysses</i>         and <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> are a day, <i>The Waves</i> is at once a day         and the duration of six lives that are also one life, <i>Finnegans Wake</i>         is a dream. None of Stein's soi-disant novels after <i>Three Lives</i>         has any such deep-structural cohesion, nor any of the other myriad forms         of artful cohesion Joyce and Woolf wove into their novels. <i>The Making         of Americans</i> is supposed to be the history of "everyone who is or         was or could be living," but most of it instead records Stein's alternation         between assertion of her intention to write that history and, increasingly         as the pages mount, despair at the impossibility of doing so. The narrative         is the record of its own failure to be written as a novel. But to say         that is in no way to condemn it, or even to judge it negatively, nor do         I intend to disparage Stein's narrative by contrasting it to Joyce's,         Woolf's or Richardson's. The pleasures of reading Stein are great, but         different.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Stein's narratives         of 1909-12 are the most extreme instances in her oeuvre of the narrative         discontinuity produced by the continuous present. In the late twenties,         she began to reintroduce certain modes of cohesion into her writing, and         the narratives she wrote in the thirties and forties are brought under         the rule of various kinds of organizing forces. Does the late Stein, then,         belong on the list with Joyce, Woolf and Richardson? Or, for an even stronger         case, the late Stein plus the very early Stein of <i>Fernhurst</i>, <i>Q.E.D</i>.         and <i>Three Lives</i>? No. Only <i>Three Lives </i>is a work of modernist         fiction, devoted like the work of Joyce, Woolf and Richardson to inventing         new fictional means to represent the processes of consciousness. Even         <i>Three Lives</i>, however, is so American, so much an eruption of modernism         from within Jamesian pragmatism and American naturalism, that it occupies         a different space within modernist fiction than that associated with the         other three.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;With Steinian         narrative of the thirties and forties, despite its moves back toward narrative         convention&#150;its adoption of modes of cohesion, particularly the recurring         motif&#150;we are still in a different universe of writing. Even if we         ignore the issue of genre, which we would have to because most of Stein's         narrative work in this period, especially the most interesting work (for         example <i>The Geographical History of America</i>, and <i>Lectures in         America</i> itself), is not fiction at all but rather some form of extended         meditation, the narrative time in which Stein wrote was still a version         of the continuous present. <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, for all its limitless         plenitude, can be and has been outlined. The significance of this outline         for my argument here is not so much that it implies an ordered whole,         but that none of its constituent parts reproduce one another. Each chapter,         and each subsection within each chapter, opens up a new, different portion         of the fiction's universe. Even in the most apparently outlineable work         by Stein, <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, which is divided         into successive chronological chapters, subsectional summaries would be         forced to repeat one another. It is not that the chronological chapters         are nonfunctional&#150;the text does in fact roughly follow its announced         chronological ordering. But within each chapter, the text circles and         recircles, repeats and rerepeats, jumps ahead and jumps back in time,         moving with the associative movement of Stein's memory as she writes.         Again, the narrative fact most significant for both production and reception         of this text is the Steinian continuous present of writing, in which knowledge         is reinvented and rediscovered from moment to moment, not the chronological         time of the overall, in a significant way artificially superimposed, narrative         structure.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Even when discussing         the shift in the clientele at her famous Saturday evening salons, as they         became progressively more famous, for example, Stein undermines the chronological         progression as soon as she establishes it. She says "Everybody brought         somebody. As I said the character of the Saturday evenings was gradually         changing, that is to say, the kind of people who came had changed. Somebody         brought the Infanta Eulalia and brought her several times" (123). "As         I said" establishes the essential motif of repetition that dominates the         text. "Was gradually changing," implying steady progression, shifts within         one sentence to "had changed," an accomplished fact. This shift destabilizes         the distinction between the present of remembering and the past that is         remembered. "Everybody brought somebody" levels the sense of hierarchy         implied by increasing fame and by the Infanta Eulalia. The Infanta Eulalia         herself becomes a moment of repetition, as the "everybody" who "brought         somebody" is converted into the "somebody" who "brought the Infanta Eulalia         and brought her several times." Four paragraphs later, after a few more         famous names are mentioned (Lady Cunard and Nancy Cunard, Lady Ottoline         Morrell, "a roumanian princess"), this social ascent is definitively levelled,         and the diachronic time in which social ascent must live is effectively         annihilated: "It was an endless variety. And everybody came and no one         made any difference. Gertrude Stein sat peacefully in a chair and those         who could did the same, the rest stood. There were the friends who sat         around the stove and talked and there were the endless strangers who came         and went. My memory of it is very vivid" (123-4).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Finally, it is         the issue of memory that most powerfully differentiates Stein from the         other three, especially Joyce, and from the quintessential modernism they         represent. There is hardly anything that Joyce does not remember, and         memory itself is a crucial preoccupation for him, while a moment of vivid         memory for Stein, that presents itself to her as a memory, is unusual         enough to be remarked upon. Generally the past, to have reality to Stein,         exists as the present. There is no cultural or psychic past for her to         hold up to the present, to hold up the present, to be faithful or unfaithful         to, to be guided by, to reinvent, rediscover and transmogrify into art.         Modernism in fiction can be said to have memory, "la recherche du temps         perdu," as one of its raisons d'etre and central tropes. Stein's work         in narrative is defined by her repudiation of that trope. It is a commonplace         to label Stein a postmodernist before her time; in this respect, if we         follow Jameson's analysis of the postmodern as annihilation of history,         as subsumption of all history to an inescapable present, then Stein certainly         qualifies.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;But let me not         seem disingenuously to ignore the James Joyce Society's obvious reason         for including Stein on its panel's list of names. Most people would look         at that list and think not of Sesame Street but of a great man and three         great contemporaneous women. Or if they did see the list within the grid         that jingle enacts, perhaps then it would be Joyce who didn't belong.         Or the other three. There are many ways of aligning Stein, Woolf and Richardson         according to gender and distinguishing them from Joyce. One way would         be a modified version of the argument I have been making about Stein's         difference from the three modernist novelists. While Woolf and Richardson         wrote very much in and of the passage of time, and not in any sort of         continuous present, neither of them felt the need, pull or support of         a legitimating, authorizing, or threatening connection to any officially         sanctioned version of cultural history. This is precisely where accounts         of modernism based primarily on works by men, and uninformed by considerations         of gender difference, are distorted and inadequate. Neither Daedalus nor         Icarus, cultural god nor his victim son, Woolf and Richardson were free         to rewrite the past, in "women's sentences" (<i>A Room of One's Own</i>),         as a different history of women, and Stein, writing in "a little language         such as lovers use" (<i>The Waves</i>), more or less to abolish it altogether.</font></p>      <p align="CENTER"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Works         Cited</b></font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">DeKoven, Marianne.             "Breaking the Rigid Form of the Noun: Stein, Pound, Whitman, and Modernist             Poetry," in <i>Critical Essays on American Modernism</i>, eds.
