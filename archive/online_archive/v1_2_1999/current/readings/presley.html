In doing so I shall         also refer to her philosophical and autobiographical prose writings which         provide an indispensable context for her theory of the female subject.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;A few critics         have already referred to this aspect of her work. Clair Wills has written         about the ways in which women's lives as a political issue are taken up         in experimental poetry; and gives a close analysis of texts by Lyn Hejinian         and Denise Riley. I quote here from her conclusion:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My discussion             of Hejinian's and Riley's work has suggested that, despite their use             of experimental poetic forms, which question the coherence of the             poetic &quot;voice&quot; and the consistency of the speaking &quot;I,"             their poetry is nonetheless strongly weighted towards articulating             questions of interiority and emotional inwardness. But that interiority             is defined less as a fixed identity than as a series of processual             identifications with elements of both the private (familial) sphere             and the public world, in which language comes to us already moulded             by the media. (1)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;I think that         Wills runs the danger of too closely identifying Hejinian's work with         that of Riley, and of linking both of them too closely to a critical discourse         of post modernism and feminist psychoanalysis. It is important to look         at the formative influences on Riley's work and how these shape her theory         of identity.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Romana Huk has         also examined Riley&#146;s poetry and how it does, or does not coincide         with the experimental, especially Language oriented poetry. She has described         Denise Riley as bridging the gap between more traditional poetic form         and the experimental. Huk, like Wills, also focused on the retention of         the subjective lyric in Riley's work, and argues that Riley casts an &quot;I&quot;         into her poems which is not stripped of flesh and thrown into the word         horde, but that demonstrates historical, gendered, socio-economic and         other particularities of positioning. Huk concludes that Riley contains         theoretical &quot;universalisms&quot; by moving with them through time         and space from within her own subjective limits.

Its title is undercut by the poems which follow in         which the infants are her own, and what she has to teach them has far         more to do with feminism and feminist linguistics, than with Marxism.         The first poem is "A note on sex and `the reclaiming of language.'" This         is another title which sounds like a treatise or a crib (in all senses).         The poem combines allegory and statements about sex and language, and         succeeds in challenging most traditional conceptions of how a poem should         conduct itself. It is structured around an allegorical figure, the female         depicted as the Savage, and identified with a lost and idealised tribe.</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The         middle section of the poem abandons this thin allegory, and presents an         unvarnished manifesto:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The             work is</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">e.g.             to write &quot;she&quot; and for that to be a statement</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">of             fact only and not a strong image</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">of             everything which is not-you, which sees you</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Not&quot;         is a key word in this statement. In Riley's feminism and her language         it is easier to say what a woman is not, and it is much more dangerous         to start saying what she is. She resists both feminist mythopoeia, and         also, to quote Clair Wills, the type of women's poetry in which `the emphasis         on the body as locus of representation... constitutes a denial of the         fact that identifications, like identities, always have to be constructed.         (1)</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;It         is also true that Riley's feminism derives originally from Simone de Beauvoir,         and from existentialist philosophy. The woman has to be the subject-for-itself,         a consciousness, and not a thing-in-itself, the other, the Savage.

It's called &quot;Liberty Belle," and is interesting         because it raises other issues in her discourse. In &quot;Waiting," an         account, which is not an account of her childhood, she writes: &quot;I         have no way of writing fluently about this past.&quot; She adds &quot;All         that counted was the detail," and then proceeds to give us a broken string         of vivid details from her childhood. In her poetry, however, she finds         other ways to avoid fluency, and &quot;Liberty Belle&quot; is not a typical         poem. It is a found poem, consisting of instructions from a <i>Girl's         Annual</i> for making a Liberty Belle ballet costume. It is also a reliable         detail, because she copied it into her exercise book. She is not falsifying         the past.</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;As         well as her own childhood, Riley writes about being a single parent, and         raising children on her own.

If &quot;A Shortened         Set&quot; is about the lyric as music, it is also about the stuff of lyric-feelings&#150;those         things we find it so hard to talk of accurately. In the second stanza         the scar tissue of the wound turns to the red bricks, the &quot;hot ghosts,&quot;         of the city, and she looks up for relief to the coolly distant sky. The         stanza ends with an abrupt switch of tone to the statement:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your             feelings, I mean mine, are common to us all:</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">that             puts you square between relief and boredom</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">under             the standoffish sky.</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">That         feelings, or words, are held in common is not to denigrate them, nor to         exalt them.</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;She         questions the distinction between thought and feeling, emphasising what         is common, even banal, in both:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It             is called feeling but is its real name thought?</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Moons             in their spheres are not so bland as these.</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A             round O says I feel and all agree.</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We         are a long way from the romantic lyric &quot;O&quot; which thinks itself         unique.

(10)         Riley seems to be saying that thoughts are clich&eacute;s too, but that         doesn't matter, because we have to stick with the common, with the democracy;         even though it is, in her sound bite, a social democracy of loneliness.</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">She         reflects on her history and ours, our youth and hers:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I             was signed up for a course </font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">on             earth by two others who left me and</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">left             me impossibly slow at Life Skills</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">at             admitting unlikeness...</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We         are reminded of her search for &quot;likeness&quot; in <i>Marxism for         Infants</i>.

The voice of these stanzas is still in         the city, but refreshed by rain, the possibility of communication, and         the chance of resting. It isn't, of course, all good news. For instance,         although there is a friend's shout, it is blown inaudibly.
