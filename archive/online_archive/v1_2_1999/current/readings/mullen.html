At the same time, it's not unusual         to find that what intrigues and inspires me as a poet may not necessarily         be an experimental work, or a work of poetry. Something like an alternative         strand of African-American innovation is beginning to emerge, one that         includes a quorum of black women writing in the U.S. The textual experimentation         of Julie Patton may have an antecedent in the visually graphic poems of         poet Julia Fields, just as Adrienne Kennedy's plays opened aesthetic possibilities         for Suzan-Lori Parks. My own work with prose poetry and with the idea         of multiple voices probably owes something to Ntozake Shange's choreopoems,         and her mixed genre novel, <i>Sassafrass</i><u>,</u><i> Cypress, and Indigo</i>.         I also know that my sense of the sentence and the paragraph in prose poetry         is as much influenced by Gwendolyn Brooks' prose poem novel,<i> Maud Martha</i>,         as it is by Gertrude Stein's <i>Tender Buttons</i>. The novels and short         stories of Gayl Jones, which might have influenced poet and performance         artist Akilah Oliver, have also left a deep impression on my consciousness.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Other black women         whose work explores the possibility of innovation include Erica Hunt and         Charlotte Carter, who also frequently write in the form of the prose poem.         If I include black Caribbean and Canadian women, some of them living now         in the U.S., I can point to Michelle Cliff's essay-memoir, <i>Claiming         an Identity They Taught Me to Despise</i>, Jamaica Kincaid's <i>New Yorker</i>         short stories collected in <i>At the Bottom of the River</i>, and M. Nourbese         Philip's poetry in<i> She Tries Her Tongue: Her Silence Softly Breaks</i>         and <i>Looking for Livingston.</i> Amazingly, all of the women I've named         here are, so far, still alive and still publishing their work. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two others I can         name, Alison Mills and Fran Ross, are probably still living, although         they apparently have ceased to publish new work. Both have disappeared         from sight as active writers. In the same year, each one appeared as a         blip on the radar screen, publishing a single, eccentric novel, before         disappearing from sight. Alison Mills' novel, <i>Francisco</i>, was published         in 1974 by Reed, Cannon, and Johnson, an independent press established         in Berkeley by three black writers, Ishmael Reed, Steve Cannon, and Joe         Johnson. Before turning my attention to Fran Ross, the subject of this         paper, I will briefly mention that <i>Francisco</i> is a novel with a         first-person narrator who could be described as a "blippie," that is,         a black hippie.(8) Mills's female protagonist, a disillusioned actor,         lives &quot;from place to place,&quot; in a succession of apartments,         cottages, beach houses, and spare rooms as the guest of relatives and         friends, an itinerant cast of bourgeois and bohemian characters including         lawyers, filmmakers, dancers, musicians, writers, acid heads, sexual adventurers,         con artists, and petty thieves.(14) The narrator begins the book by confiding         to the reader:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">i got up at eleven             this mornin after layin round, rollin round in the bed, huggin round             in the bed with this friend of mine. i say friend cause i ain&#146;t             heard him qualify the relationship yet.</font></p>          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">i&#146;ve heard             girlfriend which does not exactly appeal to me. besides in all nonbullshit,             friend is the truest and best word.<a href="#1">[1]</a></font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the end of the         novel, she and her lover, a black independent filmmaker named Francisco,         have broken up, and the book ends:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I mean I woke             up at eleven this mornin, after layin round rollin round, tossin and             turnin round with this friend of mine. me.(92)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This slender diary-like         novel reveals the emotional and social range of a sensitive and thoughtful         young black woman who is as likely to see her friends at the Polo Lounge         of the Beverly Hills Hotel, or on a nude beach in Malibu, as at the upright         piano of a Bay Area blues club, or at a &quot;greasy recordin studio&quot;         in a garage &quot;near watts.&quot;(21) While the writing itself is not         strikingly innovative, I recall how surprising and how inspiring it was         to find this delightfully different black character with an emergent feminist         consciousness. The other novel, published in the same year as <i>Francisco</i>,         is one that I missed at the time it came out. I only discovered it later,         in the early 1990s, and by then it was already out-of-print. But even         then, it was an exciting find, a headstrong, quirky, and capricious novel         with an artfully playful approach to language.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Fran Ross&#146;s         <i>Oreo</i>, the Ancient Greek myth of Theseus' journey into the labyrinth         becomes a linguistically riotous feminist tall tale of a young black woman's         journey from Philadelphia to New York in search of her Jewish father.         <i>Oreo</i> is a formally inventive picaresque novel written as a series         of language games, jokes, riddles, comic translations, and arch etymological         puns that call to mind crazily erudite vaudeville routines performed by         comedian Professor Irwin Corey; elaborately constructed shaggy dog stories         with absurdly farfetched punch lines delivered with the raised eyebrow         of Groucho Marx; the high hipster monologues of Lord Buckley; and the         X-rated comedy of Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As far as I know,         this is Ross's only published novel, and it seems to have been almost         completely forgotten, as if readers and critics were struck dumb by the         unanticipated kicks, jabs, and gags of this outrageously pun-filled polyphonic         novel which, like Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>, is loosely based on a classical         text. Ross's etymological puns trace her tongue back to its Latin and         Greek roots, at the same time that her novel updates an ancient myth with         several new twists, including a heroic feminist protagonist.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Oreo</i> apparently         failed to find its audience, possibly because, in the process of commingling         two ghettoized vernaculars, African-American and Yiddish, the novel also         draws upon material that both black and Jewish readers might find offensive         or perplexing. Ross's double-edged satire includes a reverse-discrimination         tale of an all-black suburb where a local ordinance is selectively enforced         to keep white people from moving into the neighborhood, a black radio         announcer's script of an advertisement for Passover TV dinners, a joke         about the heroine's odds of inheriting sickle cell anemia and Tay-Sachs         disease, and a fight in which Oreo beats a predatory pimp to a pulp while         wearing only a pair of sandals, a brassiere, and a <i>mezuzah</i>. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ross's episodic novel         indiscriminately mixes high and low comedy, marrying sophisticated bon         mots with crude scatological humor. I can well imagine that its title,         plot, subject matter, and irreverent satire must have been at odds with         the cultural nationalism of other works published by black writers in         the 1970s, not to mention the works of established Jewish authors such         as Saul Bellow, whose Mr. Sammler makes a brief cameo appearance in Ross's         novel. I found a copy of its first and only edition while browsing in         a used book store that has since gone out of business. Throughout the         novel, Ross shows off a repertoire of word play and linguistic gags, as         well as her own particular sense of feminine humor, as in the dialogue         between the heroine and her mother in a passage titled &quot;Helen and         Oreo shmooz&quot;:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Helen said, &quot;Have             you seen the TV commercial where the housewife is being stoned to             death for using the wrong detergent, and this voice comes from out             of the burning bush to egg the stone throwers on?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot;             said Oreo. &quot;The bush is your father. Have you seen the one where             the housewife gets a rash when a little man jumps out of her toilet             bowl?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;The bowl and the rash&#150;your             father. What about the one where the man is thinking of telling his             wife she has dandruff, while the woman is thinking of a good way to             break it to him about his b.o.?&quot; &quot;The b.o. and the dandruff&#150;my             father,&quot; said Oreo. &quot;No, the woman.&quot; Helen explained             that Oreo's father was now the king of the voice-over actors... &quot;Any             reason why he never visited [us] or bothered to drop us a line or             even acknowledge our existence?&quot; asked Oreo. &quot;Of course             there's a reason.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;He's a shmuck.&quot;             That made sense to Oreo.(78)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Christine Clark,         nicknamed Oriole, the bird, but called Oreo, the cookie, is the child         of an African-American mother and a Jewish father. Oreo's parents divorce         shortly after her younger brother is born, and she grows up knowing only         the black side of her family: her African-American mother, Helen, her         brother, Jimmie C., and her mother's parents, James and Louise Clark.         Each member of the family has a different idiosyncratic relationship to         language, thus contributing to Oreo's linguistic skill, and opening the         text to a variety of verbal experiments and variations on the spoken and         written word. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">James, Oreo's grandfather,         is speechless following a paralyzing stroke that occurs minutes after         hearing that his daughter "was going to wed a Jew-boy." (3) Her grandmother,         Louise, speaks an almost incomprehensible Southern dialect. Oreo's mother,         Helen, speaks standard English sprinkled with Yiddish she learned from         her father, who before his stroke ran a mail-order publishing business         selling religious books and pamphlets to an exclusively Jewish clientele.         Helen is a gifted professional musician and eccentric amateur mathematician         who ponders whimsical "head equations" whenever she suffers from boredom         or distress. Oreo's younger brother, Jimmie C. expresses himself with         a secret musical language of his own invention, and prefers to sing rather         than speak. When a neighbor's tomcat loses a fight with an alley cat,         the woman announces, "My cat's a coward." The sensitive Jimmie C., who         has put his fingers in his ears during the cat fight, hears "Mah cassa         cowah," thus providing the family with a strange new idiolect: </font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jimmie C. was             delighted. He decided to use this wonderful new expression as the             radical for a radical second language. &quot;Cha-key-key-wah, mah-cassa-cowah,"             he would sing mysteriously in front of strangers. &quot;Freck-a-louse-poop!"             Oreo recognized the value of Jimmie C.'s cha-key-key-wah language             over the years. For her, it served the same purpose as black slang.             She often used it on shopkeepers who lapsed into Yiddish or Italian.             It was her way of saying, &quot;Talk about mother tongues&#150;try             to figure out this one, you mothers.&quot;</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ross's novel can         be read as a deliberate extension of the possibilities for expression,         humor, self-defense, intellectual stimulation, and aesthetic pleasure         in the various mother tongues and acquired or invented languages that         the heroine can claim as her own, from the almost unrepresentable dialect         of her African-American grandmother to the gevalting Yiddish-English that         is the lingua franca of several relatives on both sides of her family.         In addition to the vernaculars of her own blood relatives, Oreo can also         claim fluency in the salty street talk of hustlers, pimps, and prostitutes,         as well as the obscure erudition of cranky scholars.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a discussion of         Oreo's grandmother's southern speech, Ross embraces black vernacular English         as an expressive medium and a variety of language with its own distinction,         subtlety, and complexity, while also refusing to privilege it as a badge         of African American authenticity:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Louise Clark's             southern accent was as thick as hominy grits. No one else in the Philadelphia             branch of the family had such an accent. Her mother and father had             dropped theirs as soon as they crossed the Pennsylvania state line.             Her husband could have been an announcer for WCAU had they been hiring             [black people] when he was coming up. While all about her sounded             eastern-seaboard neutral, why did she persist in sounding like a mush-mouth?             One reason: most of the time her mouth was full of mush or some other             comestible rare or common to humankind.</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The text continues         with the following aside on Louise's speech: </font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From time to             time, her dialogue will be rendered in ordinary English, which Louise             does not speak. To do full justice to her speech would require a ladder             of footnotes and glosses, a tic of ostrophes (aphaeresis, hypherisis,             apocope) and a Louise-ese/ English dictionary of phonetic spellings.             A compromise has been struck. Since Louise can work miracles of compression             through syncope, it is only fair that a few such condensations be             shared with the reader. However, the substitution of an apostrophe             for every dropped g, missing r, and absent t would be tantamount to             tic douloureux of movable type. To avoid this, some sentences in Louise-ese             have been disguised so that they are indistinguishable from English.</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Oreo's linguistic         heritage is as much a product of her hyperliteracy as it is a legacy of         oral culture. We are told that "Oreo did not go to school" but instead         received an unusual education with a private tutor funded by her anti-Semite         grandfather's backlist of Judaica, her grandmother's winnings from playing         the numbers with the aid of a dream book, and her mother's earnings as         a concert pianist (45). In short, although this book is a novel, Oreo's         training is suitable for the work of a poet. Chiefly, she learns to go         back to her linguistic roots as a native English speaker, digging up buried         puns and resurrecting long dead metaphors that lie below the surface meanings         of words in the substrata of the language. The following passage sums         up the pedagogical relationship and its effect on Oreo's linguistic prowess:         </font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Oreo became adept             at instantaneous translations of the professor's rhizomorphs. &quot;Mr.             Benton is worn out by childbearing. Of course, his paper was an ill-starred             bottle. I don't wonder he threatened to sprinkle himself with sacrificial             meal.&quot; &quot;You mean,&quot; said Oreo, &quot;that Benton is             effete, his paper was a fiasco, and he wanted to immolate </font></p>          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">himself.&quot;             The professor was impressed but not struck dumb. &quot;I am phonofounded,&quot;             he said logodaedalyly.(47)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With the formal education         she receives from an impoverished linguist, plus the informal tutoring         of an opinionated milkman and the neighborhood nymphomaniac, Oreo acquires         both book knowledge and street savvy. Not only can she compete in any         contest of verbal wit, but she also practices her own brand of martial         art when forced to protect herself from physical assault. Oreo's grandfather         is silent for much of the novel; her grandmother speaks a Southern dialect         alien to the Northeast; her brother sings a secret invented language that         resembles a cross between baby talk and the ooga-booga lingo of natives         in old Tarzan movies; her mother communicates with her mostly in writing;         and one of her acquaintances spends entire days speaking English with         the accent, inflection, and syntax of various foreign languages. With         such influences, one might expect that Oreo's approach to language is         idiosyncratic as well. She is a child who entertains herself by reading         the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> for the insider jokes she dicovers         in the etymological speculations of lexicographers. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Oreo's linguistic         prowess and her arsenal of wit enhance her self-confidence and provide         her with the means to turn ordinary tasks and events into opportunities         for play. Her homework assignments become Oulipo-like exercises in textual         transformation, as she finds alternative modes of thinking and writing.         Significantly, the moment that signals her readiness to begin her quest         for complete self-knowledge is a test of her verbal ability. Just before         she leaves home to search for her father, who has left her a list of cryptic         clues, she completes her final essay-writing assignment and applies a         compositional procedure that turns a sample of dull expository prose into         a work of potential literature. </font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For her last             assignment, the professor had given her a standard treatise in the             field of economic agronomy upon which she was to model an essay on             the same subject. She read the first and last words of the treatise,             titled <i>Lying Fallow, or What You Should Know About Federal Subsidies</i>,             and started and ended her essay with similar words. In <i>Lying Fallow</i>,             the first word was snow and the last word was potatoes. Oreo experimented             with monsoon and broccoli as her first and last words, but decided             they were too exotic, and, what is more, monsoon had too many syllables.             Already she had strayed from the obvious pattern of Fallow's author             had established with his forceful yet sensitive first and last words.             After an evening with Roget, Oreo decided that her first word would             be rain and her last word rice.
