Stoker's Mina Harker, &quot;this plain         Jane secretarial adjunct,&quot; in Bellamy's hands becomes her own subject         who vows never to &quot;perish in domesticity like a Jane Austen heroine."         In the wings: AIDS and death exercise their insatiable appetites. By blurring         the lines between sexual and literary articulation (&quot;my throat is         a cunt"), Bellamy/Harker &quot;suck up the silence." Gender, genre, and         class crash in <i>The Letters </i>in a culture bomb. "I am a post-punk         Milton waging a one woman war against structure, taste, logic and even         words themselves."(207)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bellamy's "bestiare         d'amour" has an affinity with Kathy Acker's no-holds-barred approach and         the work of Dennis Cooper and other "new narrative" writers. Identity         is always in question; boundaries always at risk. Mina and Dodie defy         pinning down. They're shifting, in constant motion. Bellamy constructs         a sophisticated doppleganger effect between author and subject, undermining         her own position of mastery by implicating herself on the page. &quot;Dodie's         so much more constructed than I. She makes a clone of herself, Mina Harker."         Mina/Dodie's voracious appetite/cunt/writing (where does one end and the         other begin?) gulp down everything&#150;cum, pop, cock, culture, films,         history, literature, horror, philosophy, fast food, sex, and anything         else she can get her hands and mind on&#150;spewing it back &quot;bursting         with plots you never stop narrating." (Although this is said about Sam         D'Allessandro, it also describes <i>The Letters</i>.) Narrow and binary         definitions of form and content, theory and creative work, high and low         life, authenticity (&quot;Who cares if it's true or merely a dream spiraling         into the darkness, a piece of cheap dinnerware covered with jewels"),         class, and gender are uprooted and exposed in all their complexity in         <i>The Letters</i>.(62) This mish-mash of high and low raw matter is the         stuff used to create a glittering universe. &quot;Yet all that was sick         or hysterical about her behavior in day-to-day life could be turned into         something valuable through the act of writing."(15)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Historically, the         epistolary novel has its origin as a form used by male writers to tell         the private, supposedly &quot;authentic" (read unmediated) story of a         woman's seduction, abandonment, and fall. Claire Goldstein points out         that &quot;from the seventeenth century on, the letter becomes associated         with the feminine" and is encoded feminine in several ways: &quot;as an         activity engaged in by women, as a published genre appreciated by a largely         female audience, and also as <i>a reflection of a certain cultural image         of female character</i>."(575, emphasis added) The letters are usually         presented as written for private not public purposes. Once they have been         made public&#150;after some remarkable or fortuitous chance&#150;they         are presumed to be part of a secret and therefore more revealing, more         authentic text. Frequently the female subject, as in <i>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</i>         or <i>Clarissa</i>, is of a "propertied" family. That is, she is not working         class. There would be no tragedy to reveal in telling the tale of a poor         or working class woman's fall. She is already fallen. She is always the         other woman: sexualized, disposable, already erased, not part of the cultural         economy. Middle and upper class women are located as pure, clean, virginal,         marriageable, and therefore part of the cultural economy though often         as an object of exchange and consumption. Goldstein notes that &quot;the         style and format attributed to epistolary prose&#150;natural, light, naive&#150;resemble         the style of conversation cultivated in <i>aristocratic</i> women and         enforced by cultural discourse and instruction.&quot;(575, emphasis added)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As Kathy Lou Schultz         points out, "while it is now possible to identify a trajectory of experimental         women's writing, to inhabit a vocabulary of gender and sexuality, references         to class often remain just that: mere codes." Bellamy's <i>The Letters         of Mina Harker</i> challenges codes of social decorum and propriety, and         their relationship to class, at every turn. In <i>The Letters</i>, Bellamy         takes the form of the epistolary novel and wrests it from its &quot;high"         ground. She launches her culture bomb, exploding the discrete notions         of anything that could be considered &quot;natural," &quot;authentic,"         &quot;light," &quot;naive," and makes something new and endlessly expandable,         exponentially multiplying the details, descriptions, digressions sounding         out&#150;&quot;in medias mess"&#150;&quot;the joyful, troublesome, gender,         genre [class] exploding noise."(Retallack 351)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bellamy&#146;s challenges         expose even while acknowledging that the codes of gender (and I&#146;d         add class) make anything she does twice as shocking than anything a man         might do. &quot;I like to talk dirty too,&quot; Bellamy states, &quot;But         sometimes it's such a yawn since all the cards are stacked on my side&#150;being         female, anything I do is automatically twice as shocking as anything you         do...&quot;(19). She out-others the notion of Other, thereby overturning         one of the organizing principles of the epistolary genre: &quot;...having         been an Other since the day I was born, being the other woman was small         potatoes to me."(56) Our author is seductress; married woman (to a gay         man and writer, &quot;KK"); the other woman; a woman fantasizing about         her favorite &quot;Victoria's Secret&quot; model, Fredrique; the frump         in a torn bathrobe at the keyboard, writer; woman who sits apart from         another woman&#150;&quot;her face every inch of it covered with lipstick"&#150;to         &quot;show they have different futures", and a host of others.(22)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Identity is always         fluid and gender open for appropriation: "I loved it when my tits or my         cock or my asshole would destroy my own ego with their needs."(181) &quot;I'm         amazed at my erection long and hard and colorful."(23) And while the effects         of class in the hands of many may be buried in codes, Bellamy takes a         different tactic: &quot;Thus did I understand that Rendezvous and I were         involved in a conflict of form&#150;he approached me from behind sneaking         up on my subconscious like a tracking missile (he calls this letting things         pass, I called him a passive-aggressive asshole). I'm the William Tell         type, firing at a person point blank (he called me a controlling bitch,         I call this getting things out in the open)..."(214). Bellamy eradicates         boundaries between what can be articulated and how in public or in private         and risks the consequences of doing so, particularly at the heart of the         intersection of class, gender, and innovative writing. Bellamy has remarked         on the SUNY poetics listserv that &quot;the feminist poetics scene in         San Francisco nourished me&#150;but it became quite clear fairly early         on that I was not going to be supported there (quite the opposite) for         the sexuality and vulgarity I was moving towards. (Though it wasn't as         bad as when I recently read in Cambridge and nobody would look me in the         eye or talk to me after my reading.)&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By assuming multiple         positions (or what Schultz calls &quot;complex and mediated identities"),         Bellamy marks herself as someone struggling against the system of fixed         social, class, literary, and gender structures/strictures. She is then         invested with the power to address, unseat, lay bare, redress whatever         may fall under her gaze and pen. And yet, as Bellamy says in &quot;Reading         Tour&quot; from <i>Tripwire</i> 2, &quot;While I believe&#150;really believe&#150;that         formal innovation opens new vistas of expression, better allows me to         track a psyche's collisions with a fucked-up misogynistic culture, I'm         still plagued with self-doubt. Am I an elitist, I ask myself, am I like         one of those social climbing neighbors my mother scorned, the ones who         traipsed around with shopping bags from Marshall Field when Sears and         J.C. Penney have everything a reasonable person would need?&quot;(&quot;Reading         Tour&quot; 127-28) She still questions her particular strategies for addressing         vulgarity and sexual and innovative literary pleasures/pressures (class,         gender, genre). She remains poised, sometimes hilariously ("Life is like         marriage: who could stand the constancy if you didn't take it for granted")         at an outpost on the edge of some nether world. (119)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Bellamy's hands,         Harker is no polite, anorexic, aristocratic debutante. Right at the outset,         Bellamy's voracious appetite ("This book is the bag. So is my cunt.")         is unleashed, chowing down everything from <i>Nosferatu</i>, Duchamp,         Bram Stoker, &quot;Hill Street Blues,&quot; William Gibson, <i>The Hunger</i>,         Newton's machinery, herbaceous plants of the Amazon, bloody sanitary napkins         used as literary and sexual fodder, literary theory, and Gregory Corso,         to name just a few (and this is just in the first letter or two!).(11)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As Joan Retallack         has said in another context, but which aptly describes Bellamy's <i>Letters</i>,         "[T]he very act of attending entails a radical figure/ground shift."(345)         Good middle class girls and women are polite, taught not to discuss (or         even see) the monstrous; indeed this is part of the education for becoming         a woman in middle class society. In discussing the social pressures to         silence adolescent women, Michelle Fine notes, &quot;The voices ... echo         powerful, diverse, and yet share messages to domesticate, submit, and         be nice, if not mute." Bellamy speaks about topics which are often veiled         or kept hidden by the codes of polite, middle class conversation, literature,         and sexual politics, such as "my nose against his soft-hard cock, <i>nostrils         itching with fabric softener and urine."</i>(11, emphasis added) As she         states elsewhere, &quot;The monstrous and the formless have as much right         as anybody else.&quot;(10)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bellamy addresses         these things using a vocabulary and diction that is the marriage of street         and poetry, "I am so aroused my clit flicks like a tongue."(9) She violates         rules about where it is O.K. to speak as well: &quot;...in...the Roxie         Theater...I shout, 'That's me on the screen you assholes!"(9) &quot;Bad         metaphors are the only way we can approach the really important things,         don't you agree?" she confides, continuing by way of example, "the stars         are astonishing, the sky speckled like the black-suited shoulders of a         guy with really bad dandruff."(11) She understands the conventions of         authenticity, privacy, gossip and voyeurism on which the epistolary novel         rests: "DON'T TELL ANYBODY are the three most erotic words in the English         language."(20) Bellamy challenges what one can speak about (subject matter),         how one can talk about it (vocabulary, diction, form, taste), where (context),         and by whom (gender). This Mina is no disgraced, fallen woman. Having         joyfully positioned herself in opposition to this system, she revels in         the full menu of pleasures (and pain, rage, etc) to which she has access         and can give voice. In <i>The Letters</i>, sex, life, death, characters,         the body, desire, the text will not be contained by rules of class, gender,         and social decorum. There is mutiny here, but no muteness.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is writing without         shame. Bellamy presents the particular details of her characters' existence,         giving voice to their complexities as educated people living at a lower         economic status. An example is her description of the Kentucky Fried chicken         wedding meal, which is had while sitting on a sofa with "springs poking         my butt" in front of a 12 inch black and white TV (this is not a description         of a first married meal in middle class land!), alongside an invocation         of a Duchamp nude.(10) Others might include &quot;KK&quot; fixing his         zipper with a staple gun or the kitschy apartment with a photo of Deneuve         ripped from a magazine, strewn dirty clothes, and an ashtray from a local         restaurant. &quot;KK's&quot; face is lovingly described as being &quot;like         his thrift store clothes: worn but to the innovative never beyond mending"         while his TV dinners come from Canned Food Outlet (201). Or there is the         description of sex in the car with Dion, whose day job is hauling around         carcasses&#150;and Dion holding up a bloody finger (She has her period         and he's not cleaned up from work).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bellamy addresses         without simplifying the intricacies of class, suggesting that any elision         of such distinctions would itself be a wrong: &quot;Voice spit tears shit         a cry&#150;the refusal to emit seems like a crime."(158) This notion of         complexity is enacted formally, as the letters are addressed to multiple         others: the reader; an individual who is dead (the writer, Sam D'Allessandro);         fans; lovers; personal friends; and others who may be "fictional" characters         (Qunicey, Dr. Van Helsing). Bellamy locates the class, gender and social         pressures/conventions underlying the epistolary form and plays with those         conventions. Out of this is created a form that performs a complex relation.         It's both kitschy and sublime.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In <i>The Letters</i>,         Bellamy marries high and low culture. Texts, movies, and a host of other         second-hand material are used as jumping off points to create something         new. And because the reader may be familiar with many of these other materials,         and because of the resemblance to seemingly real people, say in the San         Francisco writing scene, the boundaries between these things are constantly         moving and in question. The novel is a performance in which, willingly         or not, everyone participates.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The writing itself         is sexualized in what could be considered a particularly female strategy.         As Genre Tallique says, "Attention to the complex discontinuities of the         feminine in language will explode the shortest distance between points         and turn it into a field of sinuous, labyrinthine lanes." Dodie/Mina say         that "the simplest narrative is the history of a gratified desire" but         then go on to create a world/text in which "she cannot resist cannot withhold         she reveals things too early, slips in the vulnerable the unwise the embarrassing         the scandalous."(42) Writing is sexy, sexual, generative, voracious, expansive:         "Writing has always been more sexual than sex, the sustained arousal of         never quite getting it right."(73) Desire is anything but gratified, certainly         not simple, or linear. Yet Bellamy understands the allure of narrative,         "I am eager for his ejaculations as I was for Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth         Bennett to marry," although she refuses the mousetrap of plot.(38) The         book openly struggles with how to "end" such a text: "So here I am, working         on my ending, going crazy with endings..."(197). The writing is full of         desire at every turn. "Eagerly he licks his cum from my mouth: I want         to bring the reader this close to writing." And she does.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps the social         and reductively defined codes of middle-class life and literature, or         any bounded area&#150;feminist writing, the novel, relationships, for         example&#150;attempt to too narrowly structure the world, whatever particular         world we're talking about. Bellamy gives voice to the complicated, the         messy, the vulgar and explicit. Her writing is multiplicitous and interwoven,         blowing up boundaries of silence and absence in whatever guise in the         class, gender, genre big bang. Like Jane Austen, an author Bellamy talks         about reading in <i>The Letters</i>, and other writers who have gone before,         Bellamy provides an important role model for writers breaking with traditional         strategies and codes about what can be explored in a literature interested         in narrative and how to address class and gender issues in the context         of innovative form.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">WORKS CITED</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bellamy, Dodie.             <i>The Letters of Mina Harker</i>.
