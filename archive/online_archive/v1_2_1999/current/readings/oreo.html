Oreo's menarche had been at age eight.         She had been minding her own business, experimenting to see whether her         pet turtle would try to mate with an army helmet, half a walnut shell,         or a swatch of linoleum (the "bottom shell hypothesis"), when she felt         a slight contraction in her lower abdomen. She was vague about the area&#150;it         happened so fast&#150;but it was somewhere below the pupik and above the         mons veneris. She went to the bathroom to check on a stickiness she felt&#150;and         saw the blood. "Oi gevalt," she said, "what the fuck is this shit?"</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">She summoned Louise,         who looked at Oreo's panties and handed her a Kotex. Louise did not believe         in tampons, which were too newfangled for her. &quot;Ain't but one thing         spose to go up in dere," she told Oreo. She explained to Oreo the implications         of this issue and that she could expect it for three to five days in every         twenty-eight. Louise was only slightly surprised that Oreo had started         so young. That was the way it was with Oreo. She was, however, astonished         when she saw that the gouts of blood had formed an American Beauty rose         in the crotch of Oreo's panties. Her own uterine lining had always reminded         her of bits of raw liver, but Oreo&#146;s bloomer decoration looked as         if it had been squeezed from a pastry bag.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"What do we call         this?" Oreo asked. "Well, you kin call it fallin' off de ruff or hab'm         de ragon or de cuss. But it mos' ladylike to say, &#145;Grandma, I have         my Purriod.&#146;&quot; Oreo shook her head. She looked at the red of         her blood, the white of the pad, the blue of the thread running down the         middle, and said, "No, I'll call it flag day."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Louise nodded her         head with satisfaction. "Dat right pat'rotic of you, chile." She left         Oreo in the bathroom and went to the kitchen. For some reason, she was         torn between fixing calf's liver Veneziana and baking a cake.

SOUNDMAN:</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mr. Soundman, Inc.,         was in a renovated brownstone on Lenox Avenue. Oreo could hear the strange         permutations of words speeded up and slowed down, rushed backward and         whisked forward, the barbaric yawp of words cut off in mid-syllable (the         choked consonants, the disavowed vowels), burdened with excessive volume,         affecting elusive portent Words were all over the floor. Words and time.         What word was that there in corner, curled up like a fetus? And this umbilicus         of sound, what caesarean intervention had ripped it untimely from its         mother root? Sound boomed off the walls, rocketing around the hallways         as it charged out of an open door marked CONTROL ROOM B.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Reep-warf-shuh, reep-warf-shuh,         reep-warf-shuh, repeated some backward sounds as Oreo stuck her head in         the door. An engineer in a desk chair wheeled among three machines&#150;two         tape decks and a master-control console&#150;his ropy arms whipping about         like licorice twists. Two pencils stuck out at forty-five degree angles         from his hedgelike natural, pruned to topiary perfection and so bulbous         that, along with his dark, chitinous skin and his sunglasses with huge         brown convex lenses, he had the look of an undersized mock-up of a movie         monster&#150;the grasshopper that spritzed on Las Vegas. The soundman         noticed Oreo on one of his whirls and motioned her into a chair. He stopped         the two tape machines. Then he deftly unreeled a three-foot length of         tape from one end of a reel, pulled it back and forth between the sound         heads (Raugh-vooff-skunge, raugh-voof-skunge, it went as it sawed between         the heads), found the spot he wanted, and made a quick slice with a razor.         The piece fell to the floor amidst the curly riot of words previously         dispatched. How many reep-warf-shuhs and raugh-vooff-skunges that piece         represented, Oreo couldn't guess. The engineer then laid a loose end of         the tape still on the reel in a groove at the front of his machine, stripped         in a piece of white leader from another reel with Scotch tape and a razor,         whirled the gray reels of his tape deck a few times, then stopped. He         walked out of the control room, motioning Oreo to follow him. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">They walked down         the hall to a small office. So far neither of them had said a word. The         engineer pointed to a chair next to a desk piled with a stack of oddly         shaped cardboards. Oreo sat down. Since the man didn't say anything but         merely looked at her expectantly&#150;or, rather, his glasses were turned         toward her&#150;she said, "I'm Christine Clark. Is Slim Jackson around?"         The man pointed to himself, then shuffled through the pile of cardboards         next to him on the desk. He held one up. It was shaped like a cartoon         balloon, and the message read: YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM. "Can't you talk?"         Oreo asked. He shook his head. After establishing that Slim was neither         antisocial nor laryngitic but mute, Oreo asked permission to look through         his balloons so that she would know the range of answers he was prepared         to give. She found the usual:</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">FORGET IT, CLYDE</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">RUN IT DOWN FOR ME</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">RIGHT ON</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">LATER FOR THAT</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">GROOVY</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">TOUGH TITTY</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I CAN DIG IT</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">WATCH YOUR MOUTH</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">DIFFERENT STROKES         FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">She saw that he had         translated the typical cartoon asterisk-spiral-star-exclamation point-scribble         as a straightforward FUCK YOU, YOU MUTHA. He had a pile of blank balloons         and a stack of balloons with drawings: a cocktail glass with an olive         followed by a question mark; a Star of David followed by a question mark;         an egg-shaped cartoon character with a surprised look on its face (the         "That's funny&#150;you don't look Jewish" follow-up to the Star of David?         Oreo wondered); an inverted pyramid of three dots and an upcurving line;         the three dots again with a downcurving line; a clenched fist with the         middle finger raised in the "up yours" position. These last Oreo thought         redundant, since Slim could easily pantomime them or use an available         word balloon. True, the drawings gave him shades of translation that might         be lost in the original gesture. Besides, his blank cards indicated that         he was not unaware of the limitations of form balloons. Oreo conceded         her argument with herself to herself. Yes, both the words and the drawings         had a place.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I was told I might         be able to find Sam Schwartz here," Oreo said. Slim pulled one of his         pencil antennas out of his hair, printed something on a balloon, and held         it up: TRY NEXT DOOR TONIGHT. "What's next door?" He wrote and crossed         out, wrote and crossed out. Then held up his cardboard voice: A WH A CAT         A HOUSE OF JOY. [WH &amp; CAT are slashed out in Ross's text] "Oh, a whorehouse,"         said Oreo. Slim looked at her appraisingly. He shuffled through his standard         balloons and pulled out a cartoon of a bibbed man with his tongue hanging         out, knife and fork at the ready over a turkey drumstick. "Likes women         with big legs?" Oreo guessed. Slim looked disappointed. He shook his head         as he printed and held up: LIKES DARK MEAT. So, dear old dad is already         two-timing his second wife. "Do you know where I could find him now? Do         you have his address?" Slim shook his head. I DON'T TRY TO KEEP TRACK         OF WHITEY, he ballooned. (138-141)</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mrs. Schwartz studied         Oreo's palm silently for several minutes, her eyes rapidly scanning the         mounts and lines. With a long-nailed finger she traced Oreo's rascettes.         A chill pimpled along Oreo's right leg and around her hairline, as it         always did when she was profoundly shaken by something&#150;good or bad.         Her body registered the same sensation for Buxtehude well payed as for         singing telegrams well sung, only her brain distinguishing between what         she called "thrilly chills" and "chilly chills." Put on a sweater, her         brain told her now.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When the woman dropped         her hand as though it were a hot sea urchin, Oreo laid it to envy. She         had had her palm read before and had been told that her Mounds of Jupiter,         Venus, Apollo, and Lower Mars were transcendent, her lines of Mercury         and Life enviable, those of the Sun, Head, and Heart virtually a crime         against the rest of humanity. In short, she had a fabulous, a mythic hand&#150;the         quintessential chiromantic reading (though some might cavil at a rather         too well-developed Plain of Mars)..."Is there anything you'd like to tell         me about the reading? Anything special?"</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The woman dismissed         this possibility with a peremptory flick of the left hand. "No, no, the         usual, I am afraid. You will marry a basketball player at twenty-one,         have three children&#150;two boys and a girl&#150;and live happily ever         after." Oreo knew this was a stone lie. With her hand? Amaze the Amazons,         perhaps&#150;but live happily ever after with some jive guard and three         crumb snatchers? Foul!
