        and Avant-Garde Editing: <br>
        Comparing the 1920s with the 1990s <br>
        <br>
        by Lynn Keller and Cristanne Miller</font></b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">During the 1910s 
        and 1920s, women writers dominated the possibilities for avant-garde publishing 
        of literature in English as editors of journals and, to a lesser extent, 
        presses. This phenomenon was widely remarked at the time in England and 
        the U.S. and has been much studied recently. In 1925, a fellow editor, 
        Alfred Kreymborg, speculates about when precisely &quot;what is popularly 
        called the renaissance of American poetry&quot; began. Initially, he proposes 
        1912, &quot;when <i>The Poetry Magazine</i> first appeared in Chicago.&quot; 
        Referring later to <i>Poetry</i> and <i>The Little Review</i>, he asks: 
        &quot;Were women to play the role of pioneers formerly usurped by men?&quot;<a href="#1">[1]</a> 
        Other commentary was more acerbic. For example, Ezra Pound refers to Harriet 
        Monroe in his letters as a &quot;bloody fool&quot; in need of his guidance. 
        &quot;H. Monroe,&quot; he writes, &quot;seems to think that if her Chicago 
        widows and spinsters will only shell out she can turn her gang of free-versers 
        into geniuses all of a onceness.&quot; <a href="#2">[2]</a> Similarly, 
        Pound comments that Jane Heap and Margaret Anderson, in printing part 
        of <i>Ulysses</i> in <i>The Little Review</i>, are &quot;editrices&quot; 
        who &quot;have merely messed and muddled.&quot; Even Marianne Moore who 
        is otherwise praised in his correspondence, &quot;has the brains to edit&quot; 
        but &quot;all sewed up in a bag&quot;&#150;a remark Pound does not explain.<a href="#3">[3]</a> 
        This letter was written in 1931 to Harriet Monroe on the subject of who 
        should take over editing <i>Poetry Magazine</i> after her retirement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Here are the 
        basic facts outlining the broadest perimeters of this phenomenon. In 1911, 
        Harriet Monroe founded <i>Poetry</i>, which she edited from that time 
        until her death in 1936. <i>Poetry</i> was co-edited for three and a half 
        years by Alice Corbin Henderson, although out of gratitude Monroe kept 
        Henderson on the masthead for seven years after tuberculosis prevented 
        her from further work for the journal. In 1914, Margaret Anderson founded 
        <i>The Little Review</i> in Chicago, but soon moved the journal to New 
        York where she co-edited it with Jane Heap. Also in New York, Lola Ridge 
        was the American editor of <i>Broom</i> from 1922-1923, and Marianne Moore 
        edited <i>The Dial</i> from 1925 to 1929, beginning extensive editorial 
        assistance, when Alyse Gregory was managing editor. In England, Dora Marsden 
        founded and edited <i>The New Freewoman</i> in 1911, which was renamed 
        <i>The Egoist</i> in 1913, when Harriet Shaw Weaver took over the editing 
        and Ezra Pound assumed direction of literary editing for the journal. 
        During this time, H.D. served as literary editor for a year. African American 
        women poets also held positions of importance in literary journals: Jesse 
        Fausset was literary editor of <i>The Crisis</i> from 1919 to 1926 and 
        Gwendolyn Bennett was assistant editor of <i>Opportunity</i> from the 
        mid-twenties until 1931.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Women founded and 
        ran presses and bookstores as well as journals, although for financial&#150;and 
        perhaps other&#150;reasons, many did so abroad rather than at home. For 
        example, Harriet Weaver founded the Egoist Press; Virginia Woolf (with 
        her husband) the Hogarth Press; Bryher, the heiress of one of England&#146;s 
        largest fortunes, helped fund several avant-garde presses and publications, 
        including the Contact Press which published Moore&#146;s first collection 
        of poems. In Paris, Caresse and Harry Crosby founded and ran the Black 
        Sun Press and Nancy Cunard the Hours Press; Sylvia Beach founded and ran 
        the influential bookstore &quot;Shakespeare &amp; Co.&quot; (1914-1941), 
        which also engaged in some publishing, and Barbara Harrison founded and 
        ran the bookstore &quot;Harrison of Paris.&quot; Between them, these women 
        were responsible for publishing Joyce&#146;s <i>Portrait of an Artist</i> 
        and <i>Ulysses</i>, and first books by Moore, Williams, Hemingway, and 
        Beckett, as well as later works by Stein, Joyce, Lawrence, Eliot, and 
        of course, each other.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Women were also involved 
        in cooperative or collaborative editing with men, although here it is 
        far less clear how much influence the women had. Lola Ridge, for example, 
        worked with Kreymborg on <i>Others</i> between 1915 and 1919, taking on 
        assistant editorial responsibilities especially after 1917. Bryher provided 
        the money, and she and H.D. provided the impetus for Contact Press&#146;s 
        publication of Moore&#146;s <i>Poems</i>, although the Contact Press was 
        formally run by Bryher&#146;s husband, Robert McAlmon, and was associated 
        with his and Williams&#146; journal, <i>Contact</i>. To our knowledge, 
        no research has been done on either H.D.&#146;s or Bryher&#146;s influence 
        on other publications of the press or in the journal. Similarly, Bryher 
        founded the film journal, <i>Close-Up</i>, with Kenneth Macpherson and 
        managed its editorial office (1927-1933), but it has only lately become 
        clear through unpublished correspondence that her position involved significant 
        editorial decision-making (Marek 118). In 1925, Ethel Moorhead financed 
        and helped set up <i>This Quarter</i> with Ernest Walsh, who was then 
        also assisted by Kay Boyle for two issues. In 1926, Gwendolyn Bennett, 
        Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Huges, and others founded the avant-garde 
        magazine, <i>Fire</i>, which published only one issue. Because many of 
        these women including masthead editors like Moore downplayed their own 
        influence and direction, encouraged their male collaborators or employees 
        to take credit for joint work, or didn&#146;t protest when joint work 
        was interpreted as &quot;his&quot; (with her &quot;help&quot;), it is 
        still difficult to sort out precisely what roles various women played 
        in the collaborative editing of this period. As perhaps requires reiteration, 
        men also founded and edited important journals during this period&#150;most 
        notably Kreymborg&#146;s <i>Others</i>, McAlmon and Williams&#146; <i>Contact</i>, 
        Ford and Pound&#146;s <i>The Transatlantic Review</i> (also financed in 
        part by Stella Bowen and John Quinn), and Eliot&#146;s <i>The Criterion</i>. 
        Arguably, however, these journals did not have the cumulative pioneering 
        effect of <i>Poetry</i>, <i>The Little Review</i>, and <i>The Dial</i>. 
        It is not necessarily that women edited more experimentalist journals 
        but that those they did edit were so influential and successful.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In both the U.S. 
        and England, the women involved in editing encountered many obstacles, 
        not the least of which was jockeying by men to take over the direction 
        of their journals through heavy-handed advising (not through taking on 
        the editorial labor themselves). <a href="#4">[4]</a> It was finally, 
        however, the depression of the early 1930s that marked the end of this 
        extraordinary phenomenon and of the proliferation of experimentally oriented 
        &quot;little magazines&quot; generally. <a href="#5">[5]</a> Nothing like 
        this early twentieth-century dominance of women in avant-garde editing 
        has occurred since, although there are noteworthy similarities now at 
        the end of the century.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While these modernist 
        women were unusually talented and self-assured, historical conditions 
        help explain the rise of this phenomenon. First, these women were following 
        a well-established pattern. In the U.S., women had been prominently involved 
        in editing and publishing since the mid-nineteenth century. The most popular 
        magazine in the U.S. for decades was edited by Sarah Josepha Hale, who 
        began editing her own journal, the <i>Ladies Magazine</i> in 1828, which 
        she merged with Godey&#146;s <i>Ladies Book</i> in 1837 and then edited 
        for forty years. On the more intellectual front, Margaret Fuller was the 
        first and primary editor of the <i>Dial</i> from 1840-1842 (it folded 
        in 1844). Elizabeth Peabody published <i>The Dial</i> from 1841-1843, 
        and in 1849 founded and edited the <i>Aesthetic Papers</i>.<a href="#6">[6]</a> 
        Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin founded, published, and edited the first newspaper 
        for African American women, the <i>Woman&#146;s Era</i> in Boston from 
        1890-1897, and Ida B. Wells was an extremely influential journalist, who 
        published and edited four newspapers between 1891 and 1913.<a href="#7">[7]</a> 
        Thus, the women editing journals dedicated to avant-garde literature in 
        the teens and twenties had rich precedents for their activity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Second, by the turn 
        of the century, American and British women had legal rights to own property, 
        control their wages, and conduct their own businesses. This was key to 
        their success in the marketplace. In comparison, in Germany, where women 
        did not enjoy similar rights, no woman founded or edited a single literary 
        journal (experimental or not) during this period. The number of heiresses 
        supporting the arts through direct funding to artists and support to publishing 
        ventures may also have had a direct impact on women&#146;s roles in this 
        field. Female writer-editors received financial contributions from, among 
        others, Bryher, Peggy Guggenheim, Charlotte Mason, and Harriet Moody, 
        and individual editors received aid from several others&#150;for example, 
        Monroe from Edith Rockefeller McCormick and Bertha Palmer.<a href="#8">[8]</a> 
        While poet-editors like Monroe also received substantial donations from 
        men, others like Moore received financial assistance only from women.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Third, in the U.S., 
        the increased access of higher education to women in the late nineteenth 
        century&#150;primarily through women&#146;s colleges&#150;gave rise to 
        a powerful class of women who were encouraged to discard nineteenth-century 
        expectations about women&#146;s abilities and place, and to think of themselves 
        as intellectually and professionally equal to men. As Carol Smith-Rosenberg 
        has documented, these graduates were extraordinarily successful in entering 
        and creating various fields of professional employment, maintaining strong 
        networks to help each other, and in fundamentally altering traditionally 
        gendered modes of life. Of those completing a college degree near the 
        turn of the century from a women&#146;s college, relatively few married 
        (in comparison with the population of the U.S. generally), almost all 
        achieved financial independence, and many entered fields of employment 
        where they could direct, counsel, or teach younger women to follow similarly 
        professional paths. In Britain, academically oriented women&#146;s high 
        schools as well as women&#146;s colleges have served a similar purpose.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although not all 
        the women editing avant-garde journals completed college degrees, many 
        spent some time there or in private girls schools, and&#150;like college 
        graduates&#150;most were self-supporting and either did not marry or had 
        unconventional marriages; many organized their lives around relationships 
        with women&#150;some lesbian, some familial or professional.<a href="#9">[9]</a> 
        Networks of women were formed in other venues, too. For example, in Chicago, 
        Monroe was part of a powerful network of professional or monied women, 
        including among her friends and supporters (as well as McCormick and Palmer) 
        Jane Addams, Florence Kelly, Margaret Sullivan (literary editor of the 
        <i>Chicago Herald</i>), Ellen Peattie (literary editor of the Chicago 
        <i>Tribune</i>), and Helen Starrett and Antoinette von Wakeman, who founded 
        and edited their own &quot;weekly news/literary journals.&quot; <a href="#10">[10]</a> 
        While many of these women did not practice or hold principles that would 
        today be called feminist they were strongly conscious that, as Moore put 
        it, &quot;men have power/and sometimes one is made to feel it&quot;(&quot;Marriage&quot;), 
        and they were determined to succeed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Looking at the twentieth 
        century, one is struck by how much the social conditions of women have 
        changed. Remarkably, however, these privileged women at the turn of the 
        century had a confidence in their abilities comparable to those of women 
        today.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Probably the biggest 
        difference between the 1920s and 1990s in the publishing of innovative 
        poetry is that there is so much more of it now than there was then. We 
        have the modernists partly to thank for this, since one of their strongest 
        legacies in the U.S. has been the development of poetic trends and communities 
        via small press ventures, especially little magazines. This legacy was 
        crucial to the mid-century development of the &quot;New American&quot; 
        poetries. In recent years, the easy availability of Xerox and the advent 
        of desktop and electronic publishing have supported a further explosion 
        in alternative publishing venues. No longer dependent so exclusively on 
        journals for early publications, avant-garde writers have had access to 
        numbers of book presses unimaginable to the modernists. The 1998-99 edition 
        of Dustbooks <i>International Directory of Little Magazines &amp; Small 
        Presses</i> proudly announces listing &quot;Over 6,000 Markets for Writers!&quot; 
        The same company&#146;s <i>Directory of Poetry Publishers</i> proclaims 
        &quot;Over Two Thousand Poetry Markets!&quot; Many of the presses or magazines 
        catalogued in these sources have arisen out of particular communities 
        and respond to the tastes or needs of distinct audiences. The vast small 
        press/small magazine literary scene in the 1990s, then, is thoroughly 
        decentralized and often balkanized, though individual writers may straddle 
        several writing communities and publish in journals directed at different 
        readerships. In contrast, reflecting the changed class structure of American 
        society, external funding possibilities are at once more centralized (in 
        government and a few large granting agencies) and more elusive than in 
        the twenties, with fewer wealthy patrons now willing to support experimental 
        publishing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even the listings 
        in such massive references as the Dustbooks<i> Directory of Little Magazines 
        and Small Presses</i> prove far from comprehensive when it comes to avant-garde 
        publishing. O Books doesn&#146;t appear in the Dustbooks <i>Directory</i>; 
        nor does Tuumba, Tender Buttons, Roof, Littoral, <i>Chain</i>, <i>Idiom</i>, 
        <i>Clamour</i>, Chax, <i>o-blek</i>, Leave books, or Sun &amp; Moon. Yet 
        Talisman, Potes &amp; Poets Press, Kelsey Street, Sulfur, Post-Apollo 
        Press, and Burning Deck all do appear in that same directory. Inclusion 
        apparently reflects the preferences of the small press or magazine editors, 
        since the annual directory contains a prominent invitation to contact 
        Dustbooks in order to list a magazine or press in future editions. Inclusion 
        and exclusion seem more chancy in compilations like Spencer Selby&#146;s 
        lengthy listing for the Buffalo Website of current &quot;Experimental 
        Poetry/Art Magazines.&quot; Given the vast number of current publishing 
        projects and the limitations of existing reference materials pertaining 
        to them, it is difficult to get an accurate overview of what is happening 
        in alternative poetry publishing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite that, from 
        our perspective as academics we will hazard some generalizations about 
        gender and avant-garde publishing today. To begin with the obvious: women 
        are now tremendously important to avant-garde publishing, as would be 
        apparent merely from a list of the publications directed by women speaking 
        at this conference. Those female-led presses that have existed long enough 
        to have put out a relatively large number of books&#150;O Books or Tuumba, 
        say&#150;have played particularly prominent roles in shaping the current 
        scene.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet women do not 
        dominate in avant-garde publishing as they did in the modernist period. 
        Women appear far less frequently than men as editors in Selby&#146;s list 
        of experimental literary magazines. And the book presses that now handle 
        the largest volume of experimentalist titles in poetry&#150;including 
        Sun &amp; Moon, Potes &amp; Poets, Talisman&#150;are run by men, or, as 
        with Burning Deck, by women and men jointly. Perhaps women&#146;s less 
        exclusive leadership as publishers in the &#145;90s is a consequence partly 
        of their more equal participation and recognition as innovative poets, 
        although the number of editors in the &#145;20s who were also writers 
        (whether or not we now think of them in those terms) mitigates against 
        easy generalizations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">More certainly, the 
        level of women&#146;s involvement in experimentalist publishing in the 
        &#145;90s has been affected by the nature of recent feminist movements 
        in the U.S. The one area of poetry publishing where women clearly dominate 
        involves the kind of poetry widely recognized as feminist and/or as lesbian 
        because of its &quot;content&quot;&#150;its personal and accessible voice-based 
        testimony about individual women&#146;s lives. To recast this point slightly: 
        many of the women who are involved in American small press literary publishing 
        today devote themselves to projects that aspire to be socially revolutionary, 
        often around gender issues, but without necessary links to formal or linguistic 
        innovation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It&#146;s not surprising, 
        then, that women&#146;s contributions to experimental poetry publication 
        today are not well recognized in current scholarly narratives. Because 
        American academic feminism has generally allied itself with an identity 
        politics focus, and because the greatest impetus for reading, teaching, 
        and publishing works by women has come from feminist scholars, the view 
        from academe tends to obscure women&#146;s publishing that does not fit 
        this mold. Thus, Kim Whitehead&#146;s scholarly study, <i>The Feminist 
        Poetry Movement </i>(published in 1996)<i>, </i>assumes that there is 
        only one feminist poetry movement, best represented by Minnie Bruce Pratt, 
        June Jordan, Judy Grahn, Gloria Anzaldua, Irena Klepfisz, and Joy Harjo. 
        In her brief survey of feminist press production Whitehead does mention 
        one Kelsey Street title (Nellie Wong&#146;s <i>Dreams in Harrison Railroad 
        Park</i>), but she seems generally unaware of publishing ventures that 
        exhibit versions of feminism concerned with the gendered implications 
        of literary conventions and linguistic structures themselves. There&#146;s 
        no evidence that Whitehead even knows of the existence of as important 
        a feminist publication as <i>HOW(ever)</i>. Similarly, Cynthia G. Franklin&#146;s 
        1997 study, <i>Writing Women&#146;s Communities: The Politics and Poetics 
        of Contemporary Multi-Genre Anthologies,</i> typifies academic feminist 
        writing in focussing on identity politics as constitutive of women&#146;s 
        communities in literature.<a href="#11">[11]</a> While Franklin foregrounds 
        the politics of her choices, she does not acknowledge that such a focus 
        elides meaningful coalitions that develop around aesthetics, perhaps coupled 
        with particular social concerns. Ironically, then and this is only to 
        update a story that Kathleen Fraser told years ago in her essay, &quot;The 
        Tradition of Marginality&quot;&#150;the rise of certain kinds of feminist 
        publishing has tended to further marginalize experimentalist feminist 
        production in the academic world as in the publishing one.<a href="#12">[12]</a> 
        It has contributed especially to the invisibility of the women of color 
        whose experimentalist work resists fulfilling conventional expectations 
        for work that &quot;represents&quot;&#150;in the sense both of representational 
        aesthetics and of demographic representativeness&#150;cultural diversity. 
        <a href="#13">[13]</a> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To the extent that 
        men are more visibly powerful forces in avant-garde poetry publishing 
        of the 1990s than women, scholarly narration of recent literary history 
        could easily obscure or even overlook women&#146;s nurturing of current 
        experimentalism, especially women&#146;s importance to the earliest stages 
        of particular poets&#146; careers. Indeed, as experimentalist work is 
        more institutionalized within academe, the nature and importance of the 
        small press network involving men as well as women may be increasingly 
        overlooked. Consider, for example, the career of Susan Howe, one of the 
        best known female experimentalist writers of our day whose work is being 
        studied with increasing frequency in college and university classes. Someone 
        coming to Susan Howe&#146;s work for the first time today encounters her 
        as a poet published by New Directions, Wesleyan University Press, and 
        by Sun &amp; Moon in its &quot;Classics&quot; series&#150;the most established 
        of the presses open to experimentalist work. Now that New Directions has 
        published <i>Frame Structures: Early Poems, 1974-1979</i>, scholars need 
        not cite the small presses that first produced those early works or learn 
        who their editors were. Especially because successful mainstream poets 
        usually place their first books with a recognized university or trade 
        press, or perhaps with one of the well known smaller presses such as Gray 
        Wolf, Ecco, or Copper Canyon, academic readers (usually familiar with 
        mainstream career patterns) are not likely to attribute much importance 
        to the early small press publications. Such oversights are potentially 
        distorting not only of literary history but of the work itself: in Howe&#146;s 
        case, for instance, the early printings of &quot;The Liberties&quot; or 
        &quot;The Articulation of Sound Forms in Time&quot; are truer to her vision 
        for those poems on the page than the versions available now from more 
        established presses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Having talked with 
        Susan Howe recently about her early publication history, we&#146;d like 
        to summarize her story because it provides useful object lessons for us.<a href="#14">[14]</a> 
        Howe&#146;s first publisher was Maureen Owen, whom she met through a workshop 
        at St. Marks, and whose Telephone Books printed <i>Hinge Picture</i> in 
        1974, helping Susan gain confidence as she moved from painting to poetry. 
        Telephone Books also published <i>Secret History of the Dividing Line</i> 
        in 1978. &quot;I wonder if my work would have been published at all if 
        it weren&#146;t for Maureen,&quot; Susan remarked. Other women who stuck 
        their necks out to publish her as an unknown writer include Lyn Hejinian, 
        whose Tuumba press published <i>The Western Borders</i> in 1976, Lita 
        Hornick of Kulchur Foundation who published <i>Defenestration of Prague</i> 
        in 1983 with assistance from Susan Bee, and Brita Bergland whose Awede 
        Press published <i>Articulation of Sound Forms in Time</i> in 1989, before 
        it was collected (in significantly modified form) in Wesleyan&#146;s <i>Singularities. 
        </i> Susan found in these women not only the willingness to labor on behalf 
        of an unknown writer, but also important sensitivity to her needs for 
        page space and blank space. Yet she was also quick to note that men, too, 
        took chances on her early work. She expressed gratitude especially to 
        Eliot Weinberger, who published <i>Pythagorean Silence</i> in 1982, and 
        who &quot;backed and encouraged [her] every step of the way with <i>My 
        Emily Dickinson,</i>&quot; which Richard Grossinger published in 1985. 
        Nor did she regard sensitivity to space needs as a gender-linked gift: 
        Gale Nelson, for instance, did a beautiful job with the Paradigm Books 
        printing of the unusual textual arrangements of <i>A Bibliography of the 
        King&#146;s Book</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The interweaving 
        of women and men and of chance in avant-garde publishing is epitomized 
        in Susan Howe&#146;s tale of a publication that proved crucial to her 
        reputation: the first version of <i>The Liberties, </i>which she herself 
        produced in tandem with Maureen Owen under the ad hoc imprint of Loon 
        Press. Howe and Owen mimeographed copies of this poem on the St. Mark&#146;s 
        mimeo machine and sent them to people they thought might be interested, 
        among them John Taggart. Taggart left his copy out for Robert Duncan to 
        see when Duncan came to visit. Duncan read the poem, loved it, and started 
        writing to everyone about it. His generous recommendation significantly 
        enlarged the audience for Howe&#146;s work, especially in California. 
        He also arranged for her to give three lectures on Emily Dickinson at 
        New College, encouraging her to share and pursue her thinking about Dickinson.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Howe&#146;s complicated 
        story of gender and publishing reminds us that the nurturing of much recent 
        experimentalist writing has depended on page fathers as well as page mothers. 
        (We could note, for instance, that other female experimentalists, such 
        as Beverly Dahlen, also benefited from Duncan&#146;s generosity in advancing 
        their careers.) In recent decades, as at the beginning of the century, 
        women and men have in various ways collaborated to foster experimentalist 
        work.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the same time, 
        Howe&#146;s history speaks to the crucial role women have frequently played 
        in giving a start to today&#146;s experimentalist writers, as was so often 
        the case in the &#145;20s&#150;a role that may easily be obscured with 
        the writers&#146; canonization and with their moves to more established 
        presses. We noted earlier that it has taken several decades of both feminist 
        scholarship and study of modernism to uncover women&#146;s importance 
        to publishing at the beginning of the century. It would be a terrible 
        waste if the contributions of today&#146;s female editors were similarly 
        buried. It has been our hope in this presentation that recalling the publishing 
        history of our modernist predecessors may help clarify what is and isn&#146;t 
        distinctive about the gender dynamics of recent patterns of networking, 
        influence, responsibility, and collaboration in avant-garde publishing. 
        Moreover, looking back at the history of modernist poetry and its scholarship 
        reminds us that those of us working as scholars of the contemporary period 
        need to record the complicated networks of recent publishing, being especially 
        vigilant to see that the women whose courage and vision often led to experimentalists&#146; 
        early publications get the credit due them.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps there has 
          been no circle of writers since the sixteenth century which was more 
          dependent on private patronage, and, like such sixteenth-century figures 
          as Sidney and Spenser, many prominent modernists were subsidized by 
          a series of wealthy women or publicized by a set of powerful women. 
          Among others, Yeats was financially dependent on Lady Gregory; Lawrence 
          was sponsored by Lady Ottoline Morrell and Mabel Dodge Luhan; Joyce 
          was generously helped not only by Lady Gregory but also by Harriet Weaver 
          and Sylvia Beach; Eliot was aided by May Sinclair, Virginia Woolf, and 
          Lady Rothermere. In addition, all these men were in some sense at the 
          mercy of entrepreneurial female editors like Harriet Monroe, Jane Heap, 
          Margaret Anderson, Dora Marsden, and Marianne Moore. Finally, the careers 
          of these writers were significantly furthered by female mentors like 
          Amy Lowell, Gertrude Stein, Natalie Barney, Peggy Guggenheim, and Bryher, 
          as were the careers of Hemingway, Dos Passos, and Sherwood Anderson.</font></p>

          widespread lack of awareness that people of color produce experimentalist 
          work has many sources. In Chapter 6 of <i>The Dialect of Modernism: 
          Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century Literature</i> Michael North identifies 
          some historical roots of this situation as he examines a moment in the 
          1920s when the white Americanist avant-garde almost embraced but failed 
          to embrace a truly multicultural modernism allied with key impulses 
          in the Harlem Renaissance. Aldon Nielsen, whose <i>Black Chant: Languages 
          of African American Postmodernism</i> calls needed attention to the 
          rich variety of innovative African American work produced in recent

          black writers &quot;while compiling their genealogies of aesthetic evolution&quot;(13) 
          and to the problematic privileging of orality over the written in the 
          study of African American writing. Current little magazines like Renee 
          Gladman&#8217;s <i>Clamour</i>, which seeks experimentalist writing especially
