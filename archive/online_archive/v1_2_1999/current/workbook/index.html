      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dialogue 
      on work process: Eleni Sikelianos and Jo Ann Wasserman</font></b></font> 
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>JAW</b>: When 
        we had lunch in New York, you spoke about feeling a renewed need to communicate 
        in your poems. How are you feeling right now about making something known 
        in the poems?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>ES: &#9;</b>I 
        like the idea of the poem as a variably open or closed vessel, written 
        and read by variably open or closed readers who are not predetermined 
        by a particular course of study. Maybe I am curious about the generosities/asperities 
        one offers the reader, and the poem as a variably communicable (like a 
        disease or joy or sex) or incommunicable (like death) body.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;What is being 
        communicated, and how this occurs is, of course, potentially very diverse, 
        and, here, you would not want to be confined to a unilateral form of articulation. 
        I guess I&#146;m interested in the shifting spectrum of communicability/ 
        incommunicability within which a poem can exist, which means, maybe, that 
        I&#146;m interested in its public and private nature. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In <i>communication</i>, 
        there might be something about the poem&#146;s <i>economy</i>. As a reader, 
        I look for yield: this is &quot;good for me,&quot; or it&#146;s pleasurable&#150;sometimes 
        it&#146;s both. If I am my own implied reader, what are my rewards? As 
        a writer, I have become more and more engaged in the communication between 
        me, or some part of me, and the poem. The California poem feels like the 
        closest I&#146;ve gotten to a certain part of me. While there seems to 
        be a general trend towards the savvy use of artifice, I&#146;m developing 
        an interest in the artless part of the art.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>JAW:</b> &#9;I 
        know you have worked on longer pieces and in the accretion model of the 
        series. Is this a comfortable way for you to work?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>ES:</b> &#9;I 
        seem to have trouble conceiving of an individual, short poem. I think 
        this is partly because I often have some form of narrative project or 
        impulse involved (with a very wide definition for narrative). I have almost 
        only ever worked, with any success, <i>serially</i>; the trap there seems 
        to be that you find 64 different ways to say the same thing. I wanted 
        to try to extend my sense of continuity, to write a continuous piece (as 
        California is continuous, as time is, etc.), a novelistic or epic approach. 
        There are interruptions (as time is interrupted, as memory is, etc.) in 
        the poem (I&#146;m still trying to figure out how to handle them), but 
        there is, alas, no hero. I am trying to add the vestigial tailbone of 
        one now.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>JAW</b>:&#9;When 
        you speak in the poem of &quot;A spine brought to the whole length of 
        California,&quot; are you grappling with the size of this poem&#146;s 
        project (or in a sense, any poem&#146;s project)?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>ES:</b> &#9;And 
        the vertebral structure of the Sierras laid out along the state, trying 
        to connect that to the outlying areas (where I was) and, yes, trying to 
        find some way to unify or give structure to the poem through that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>JAW:</b> &#9;I 
        was just reading the new Jack Spicer biography (<i>Poet Be Like God</i> 
        by Kevin Killian and Lewis Ellingham) and Spicer who, like you, was a 
        Southern Californian, was quoted as saying, &quot;I want to write a poem 
        as long as California.&quot; Do you ever think of Spicer when you think 
        about your California poem?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>ES:</b> &#9;No, 
        maybe I should.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;I do think of 
        other poets, and writers, who were born in or spent significant time during 
        childhood in California, especially Southern California. There&#146;s 
        Joanne Kyger, Carla Harryman and Barbara Guest&#150;Basil Bunting taught 
        a few blocks away from me when I was a kid, although, of course, he wasn&#146;t 
        from there (Isla Vista), and I&#146;d never heard of him at the time. 
        Hugh Kenner was around, as well as Rexroth. I think of Duncan, up north, 
        and I think about Martha Graham, and her statement, something like &quot;I 
        couldn&#146;t have made the kind of dance I made, had I not grown up in 
        such a hedonistically beautiful environment.&quot; (Graham moved to Santa 
        Barbara as a child.) I think a lot about the landscape, the flora, the 
        colors. I think about the length and variety of its environments. As a 
        teenager, I spent a lot of time in the mountains, on the beach, days and 
        nights outdoors. It really was a kind of Eden, a pre-Raphaelite paradise, 
        and that was the context for these rather brutal activities that occur 
        in families, my own and other people&#146;s, and in the politics (don&#146;t 
        forget Reagan had&#150;is he still alive?&#150;his ranch near my hometown) 
        and in class and race distinctions and distortions. Steinbeck was an early 
        love. But the landscape is probably more of a local influence. It occupies 
        that pale, fuzzy homeward lost paradise in my mythography.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>JAW:</b>&#9;I 
        love when the poem says that no one in California says <i>bodega</i>, 
        because that is a reference to a way of speaking that is New York City 
        vernacular and this sets up a kind of foil for California. Do you feel 
        that there is a translation issue in the poem? I mean you now live in 
        New York and base your writing life there. Does living outside California 
        give permission for this poem to exist? Does the poem exist for you in 
        both places or some third &quot;California of the mind?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>ES:</b> &#9;I 
        don&#146;t think I could have begun the poem in California. In particular, 
        being on the East Coast, and all the kinds of binary thinking that brings 
        in, helped to trigger it. I keep wondering what Californians will think, 
        but also what will those who have never been to California make of it?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Where does the 
        poem exist? This troubles me (when I think of readers), but the truth 
        (or something like it) is that it exists both places (here and there) 
        and neither, because its logistics are really also a lost American (my 
        American) past. The area in which I grew up (Goleta, just north of Santa 
        Barbara) has changed drastically in the last twenty years. The poem takes 
        place in an era that is not pre-strip mall, but pre-preponderance of strip 
        mall. A belief in the endlessness of fields meets the endlessness of subdivision 
        mushrooms.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>JAW:</b> &#9;Does 
        the poem begin to locate both in space and time for you? When I speak 
        of time and space, I am thinking about how the poem can bring me to a 
        growing up time in the 1970s. Particularly the line about dirt bike races. 
        God, that triggered a whole tableau. It seemed like all the kids I would 
        want to be who were on TV lived, decidedly, in California at that time 
        (i.e., &quot;The Partridge Family,&quot; &quot;Family,&quot; &quot;Eight 
        is Enough&quot;). It is as if this was the first generation of characters 
        who pointedly resided in California and not in Anytown, USA. For me, living 
        on the East Coast, California seemed like the perfect, best place to be 
        young. Do you feel that what I am describing as a sort of <i>Californiafication</i> 
        of our youth is a part of what your poem is encountering?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>ES:</b> &#9;I 
        went to visit my cousins in Detroit when I was eleven, so I could tell, 
        I could tell that California was the center of the universe. Some poeple 
        say it&#146;s Paris, others Delphi; I know it&#146;s not Detroit. But 
        it was a kind of oblivious/obvious thing. On the other hand, no one I 
        know ever feels in the center at all, and there were all the ironies of 
        living in a housing project just outside of Santa Barbara, of being poor 
        and attending a school with affluent children, of living in a family of 
        freaks in a very conformist environment. Conformism was an extreme pressure 
        on many levels, from the physical demands of beach-bunnydom to a kind 
        of bland anti-intellectualism and soft-core spirituality (usually all 
        in cahoots, i.e., to be anatomically correct was to be spiritually correct, 
        etc.). So there was this feeling of being really out of it&#150;physically, 
        financially, class-wise&#150;basically of being, at the axis of all good 
        things in the universe, very off-center; and I suppose that really entices 
        me as a point of exploration and as one impetus for the poem.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The time thing 
        comes into it in that Proustian sort of way, where you&#146;re trying 
        to gather and re-collect and reinvent a time, but more than that, or through 
        that, a self, which is quite elusive. How does time past configure, become 
        or not become a part of, a present self? Writers invent themselves. I 
        am intrigued by the interrupted and continuous arc through time that is 
        or is not me. So much of that passed through a particular locale (the 
        northern edge of Southern California)&#150;I simultaneously try to deny 
        and am flabbergasted by how much place does indeed work its wiles upon 
        us. Here, we could replace &quot;place&quot; with &quot;place and time,&quot; 
        a single entity.</font></p>
