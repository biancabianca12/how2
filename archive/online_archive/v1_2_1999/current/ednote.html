Instead of the expected room with its windows, light switch,         and furniture that stays where you arranged it, there is on-goingness.         The paragraph you thought you put in the corner, just next to the floor-lamp,         ends up on the ceiling; the poetry lines you try to carefully reconstruct         exactly as the writer intended--in a kind of mobile hung from the ceiling--are         as vulnerable to electronic wobble as if they'd been blown by the wind.         Five reconstructions later, you may achieve a close approximation. There         are no walls and there is no ceiling...although endless file cabinets         DO exist somewhere out there, unless they suddenly disappear for no explainable         reason. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But one step over         the threshold, the beckoning light keeps pulling you forward into the         next imagined place because, on one level, what you are projecting appears         to be familiar for its cloudy earth atmosphere of precipitate light and         dark zones, while what you are experiencing, in fact, is without territorial         markers or predictable stops and starts. </font></p>      <div align="center"><b><font size="6">.</font></b> </div>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The How2 e-version         of HOW(ever) went on-line last March (1999), eight years after the print         version had completed its sixth volume. The impetus behind this move came         from the newly perceived need for networking and increased conversation         among women poets and scholars in English language communities--in particular,         the need for more women writers to enter into the conversation/critique         centered on innovative directions in poetry and cross-genre writing forms.         A number of excellent print journals and book projects being edited, or         co-edited, by women writers are now in place--and abundantly so (see our         "in'print" listing)-- but many of these have tended to circulate within         discretely separate geographic, academic and special-interest circles,         sometimes simply for lack of adequate small-press distribution or intra-group         networks...or sometimes as a self-elected rite of independence or dialogue         of exclusivity.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The lure of non-measurable         print space, in the sense of counting pages and paying for paper and ink         by the pound, had become increasingly tempting by 1997: Given a website         of one's own, one could "afford" to print full-length talks, long chunks         of new writing, photographs of authors and as much interesting art work         as you could find. The instant communication availability--jumping from         San Francisco to Rome to Sydney to Montreal to Berlin to Tokyo--beckoned         like a brilliantly believable hologram. One could, perhaps, invite these         private conversations into a more public--even global-- conversation.         </font></p>      <p align="center"><b><font size="6">.</font></b> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This issue, while         being the Second number to go on-line, is like an alternative First out...in         several ways. We have taken apart the original number 1, point-by-point,         in order to redesign every detail--from increased ease of browsing to         substantially more visual information (&amp; pleasure). Access to How2         is free for the browsing...we do not charge a subscription fee, nor do         we provide printed copies although we have worked to make How2 easier         to capture and print for off-line use.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beginning with this         issue, we activate the practice of inviting Guest Editors to curate three         significant sections of each issue of How2. These sections include: 1)         "reading/s" (essays, talks given in the reading/writing community, conference         papers, re-prints &amp; excerpts of significant scholarly work); 2) "new         writing" (recent poetry, short prose forms, theatre experiment, cross-genre         inventions, etc.); 3) "forum" (a roundtable discussion of "the question"         posed by the guest editor--or co-editors, of each issue. Writers for this         exchange are chosen by those editing it. The idea behind revolving guest         editors is to keep the taste and understanding of "innovation" in circulation         among a range of newcomers, as well as more seasoned participants, and         to encourage an open field of continuous practical and theoretical speculation,         including a re-definition of terms, so as to touch on--and share--a greater         range of writing practices coming out of modernist and avant garde writing         micro-communities.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For their true-grit         spirit and the often complex labors of a first time out, we are immensely         grateful to our first team of guest editors: Ann Vickery (Sydney ), for         "reading/s"; Elena Rivera (NYC), for "new writing"; and Robin Tremblay-McGaw         and Kathy Lou Schultz (San Francisco), for "forum".</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A special salute,         also, to Cole Swenson (Denver), who will regularly coordinate our "translation"         section focused on one foreign language per issue and one or several writers         in that language-- translated by English language poets, with an introduction         to the poets and their practice. In each current issue we will list the         guest editor for the following issue, with email address, so that readers         may propose work directly to those curating particular sections.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ideas for "work/book"--another         addition to H2/2--may be proposed to Managing Editor, Jo Ann Wasserman,         who will regularly coordinate this section. (See "work/book" in Table         of Contents). Shorter research finds and reading responses to works by         modernist and contemporary women pushing beyond the familiar--are invited         from any scholar, poet, student or non-categorized reader--via reportage,         journal, letter exchange, fictive dialogue, etc.-- for the "alerts" section.</font></p>      <p align="center"><b><font size="6">.</font></b> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our edited correspondence         section--"postcard"--is focused on comments in response to writing in         past issues of H2, briefest reading recommendations and excerpts from         correspondence between writer-readers. As of late August, "postcard" comments         have been added actively into existing mail, with a revolving exchange         to be continually up-dated between formal issues of the journal. Authors         of contributions for these two sections--plus the "forum"--need not be         gender-exclusive, but will be selected and edited according to their relatedness         to our concerns in this journal. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the current issue         you will find a number of full or excerpted texts--as well as informal         responses-- to talks delivered in writing-community forums or at recent         professional meetings: the "Page Mothers" conference, March 5-7, (organized         at UCSan Diego by Rae Armantrout and Fanny Howe) and the conference "Where         Lyric Tradition Meets Language Poetry: Innovation in Contemporary American         Poetry by Women," April 8-10 (organized at Barnard College by Claudia         Rankine and Allison Cummings). It is our intention to feature such written         talks--as well as a range of post-conference responses, arguments and         critique--as part of the on-going How2 public exchange.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What we need from         you:</font></p>      <ul>        <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pertinent information           for our "update" section, re. conferences in English-language format           , such as date, location and "Call for Papers".

The struggle to acquire the minimal necessary knowledge         to edit an electronic web journal has been like learning a new language         in order to read a foreign writer: each time you believe you have moved         forward in your understanding, you discover how woefully inadequate your         bit of progress is.
