One of its recurrent themes is the position of the viewing-subject in relation to the depicted subject--who is the subject of the narrative implied in so many of these works. It's clearly a matter of intending (con)fusion, an invitation to let individual identity slide a little, to join in stories  fundamental to the culture, thereby reinforcing the stories themselves and initiating the viewer into the culture as a participant.<BR><BR>One question I was exploring in writing on these works and on my viewing of them was the relationship of writing to this initiatory process--could writing disrupt it in an interesting way, at the very least creating a self-consciousness that complicates the overlap and reintroduces elements of "personal" decision--in quotes because the question of what 'personal' might, can, does mean is one of the underlying considerations.<BR><BR> <HR><BR><BR>excerpts from<B> <I>TRY</I></B><BR><BR><H4><I><B>NOLI ME TANGERE  </B> Unknown Spanish Painter, early 14th century</I></H4><BR><BR><B>1</B><BR><BR>Should the painter be distracted, should some sharp noise alarm him or passing thought disarm.

What if all concerts were performed behind a huge screen onto which was projected a long line of faces all facing us and it had always been done this way. You can see hundreds, even thousands, of faces in fifteen minutes. After that, they cease to be plural.<BR><BR><P><P><P><P><P><P><HR><H4>TRILOGY</H4><B>One</B><BR><BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>	I</B><BR><BR><BR>The guard peers closely<BR>at the painting.
