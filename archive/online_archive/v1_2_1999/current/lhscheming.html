So analyzing the strains and "schemes" through which women have         historically written verse seems -- dare I use a term so rightfully suspect         in feminist theory? -- almost natural. In Hogue's recently acclaimed book,         , this critic's own technical mastery of poetic convention, subverted         and subtended by feminist-language experiments, controls her subtle close         readings. Hogue's mastery creates a rereading of canonical and yet often         misunderstood women's poetic texts from the American tradition, beginning         with Emily Dickinson and concluding with Adrienne Rich. Such "mastery"         leads us, ironically and refreshingly, to unmastering conclusions. Hogue's         poets write, she teaches us, through "equivocation" -- Hogue's inventive         term for women poets' purposeful, strategic deviance through language.         <BR>        <BR>        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Equivocation" explains the work of what Hogue calls         "the scheme" in women's poetic subjectivity. Revisiting the Kristevan         linguistic revolution and notion of the abject, Hogue proposes that a         syntactic deviation, a "scheme," allows these women <U>to</U> scheme,         defying the supposedly "universal experience" of "the lone male poet as         visionary" dominating post-Romantic poetic convention (4). Equivocation         is the means by which women refuse to unite -- here Hogue quotes a letter         of Dickinson's -- the "'fracture within.'" Through this equivocal scheme/scheming,         a radical, diverse, divergent female subject emerges. <BR>        <BR>        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These well-anthologized women poets -- the ones we         read in high school and in college intro-to-literature classes -- do speak         a language of/for the patriarchy, the language of "proper" white womanhood.         But Hogue shows us how such language operates as female masquerade. She         shows us how to view the invisible agoraphobic Dickinson, for instance,         robed in white and pent up in the upper chambers of her father's Victorian         Amherst house, exploding through the very device of public invisibility         she chooses to mark a rhetoric of class struggle. (Dickinson, as Hogue         writes, evaded and equivocated the "controlling gaze . . . of sexual politics"         by remaining physically, literally invisible [33].) And Hogue shows us         how to view the ladylike Marianne Moore, needling into the lacework of         an intricate poetic schema, in works like "Virginia Britannia," a poetic         reproduction that blasts the mirror of American ideological reproduction.         Through Hogue's highly structural and yet lyrically written probings,         we come to see Moore as a closeted Althusserian, decrying an American         national identity built upon colonialism and aboriginal genocide. <BR>        <BR>        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hogue's general notion that white women poets subvert         white patriarchal constructions of power, masculinity and "womanhood"         is, of course, not completely new. She gives almost heavy-handed credit         to the many feminist theorists who have come before her, beginning with         classic works like <I>Madwoman in the Attic</I>, by Sandra Gilbert and         Susan Gubar. But one can only appreciate the astounding level at which         <I>Scheming Women</I> analyzes, gives structural weight to, a specific         strategy by which these particular American women writers found their         way, their voice, against enormous and threatening odds. They did so by         both gendering and racializing a <I>political</I> poetics. Hogue knows         these poetics from the inside out, a working/ publishing poet herself         since the 1970's. I recommend a further exploration of Hogue's own poetic         "equivocations" and schemes, in her multiple poetry volumes. </font></p>      <p><FONT FACE="Palatino">--Laura Hinton&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <BR>        <BR>        </font></p>      <FONT FACE="Palatino"><HR>      <BR>      <B>Bio: </B> Laura Hinton is an Assistant Professor of English at The City       College of New York, where she teaches feminist theory, women's literature       and the postmodern novel, as well as film studies.
