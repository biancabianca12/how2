Like a         locomotive moving alongside glowing wheat fields, <i>A Summer Newsreel</i>         transits through a landscape in the heart of American farm country, hunting         peculiar nostalgic imagery (&quot;So many people would like to be her         making taffy all summer and living near Holiday World where everyday is         a holiday. So many would like to be her living near Abe Lincoln&#146;s         farm near the replicas of Abe Lincoln&#146;s boyhood.&quot;); (&quot;Hey         poem, you, God&#146;s poem, what is happening today in Bloomfield?&quot;)         God, and notions of the self/poet (&quot;Is there something Brenda Coultas         can do for you? She would like to help you. She is reading and writing         and stopping to serve you&quot;). Her work is built up from the projections         of rural life (&quot;What will the Coultas family do today?/Mom will fry         bacon./Dad will work a crossword puzzle./The entire family will mow again/and         plant one mum.&quot;). These scenes are captured without framing the imagery         in sweetness or coy hipness. While the writing exhibits the idiosyncratic         and banal side-by-side, Coultas never allows her projections to devolve         into kitsch. A listing of oddities is not the focus here. In fact, the         poet goes a long way in debunking such postmodern cynicism. She is not         just showing pictures of a quirky tableau, rather, she is seeking to expose         a varied backdrop to her own competing writer-selves. The conflicting         selves who cannot place &quot;home&quot; in one location, the competing         selves who must check in and check up on each other in the making of poems,         &quot;What day//is it Brenda? It&#146;s a holiday I reply. Alternate parking/         rules apply.//So much reading and writing has already gone into this/         poem. This poem wanted to imitate a piece of smart and/ beautiful writing.         This poet wanted to write a piece of/ writing.&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>A Summer Newsreel</i>         is a film about the making of a film ( her first book, <i>Early Films,</i>         was published by Rodent Press in 1996). The poet&#146;s own little &quot;Hearts         of Darkness&quot; (a film about the making of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;).         All secrets are out, &quot;This poet wanted to write a piece of/ writing.&quot;         <i>A Summer Newsreel</i> captures the life that goes into the making of         this writing. It is the fantasies (&quot;so nude the farmers on John Deere         combines, reapers of/corn now reapers of men/foolish nudes among the yarrow&quot;)         and desperate needs (&quot;In first grade I prayed for God to send me         a friend. It took/almost a year to receive a friend from God.&quot;) of         a poet&#146;s history. It is an attempt to report honestly. It is the         footage of this reportage. The succession of individual images is held         together by Coultas&#146;s urgency to connect out into the world, a world         that is beyond the writing of poems but essential to that writing. She         is urging us to read on, &quot;I&#146;ve stopped writing, but keep reading,         Reader, open your/ vessels and keep reading.&quot; She is asking us to         read on honestly and help her continue to imagine a life of writing poems.         The entry point for the book is a call to singing something true, &quot;Is         singing a song, an American song, an American folk song allowed?&quot;         This is not a rhetorical question. Brenda Coultas would really like to         know.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(back         to top)</font></a></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><a href="index.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(back         to Alerts)</font></a></font></p>      <FONT FACE="Palatino">       <P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="../index.html">(table         of contents)</A></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">         </font>       <hr>      </font>      <p><FONT FACE="Palatino">        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../../../Images/navbar.swf">          <param name="quality" value="high">          <embed src="../../../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>        </font>      </p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="152" height="1" valign="top"><img width="152" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="4" height="1" valign="top"><img width="4" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="33" height="1" valign="top"><img width="33" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>  </tr></table></BODY></HTML>
