Some of these words are "women," "where" and "meets." I         will also pass through "lyric" and "tradition," "literary history" and         "innovation."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">WOMEN</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To call for, to notice,         to notate, to comment upon the productive presence of women artists and         writers in this era is to be indebted to feminist cultural criticism and         related modes of cultural poetics, such as ethnic criticisms. I would         like therefore to peel back the word "women" and see what happens to some         of the narrative of literary history Perloff proposes if we openly declare         our collective debt to feminism. As Woolf said in <i>A Room of One's Own</i>,         certain material differences between men and women are constructed and         perpetuated in our societies. It is the task of feminist politics to resist         these, to try to dismantle them, and the task of feminist inspired gender         critique to understand the impact of these material differences on the         production, dissemination, reception and continuance of artists and texts.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Feminist cultural         poetics has primarily engaged itself with <i>female</i> <i>subjectivity</i>         and <i>female agency</i>, but the self-conscious critique of male subjectivities         in and as poetry is of increasing and necessary importance, since gender         is not only woman, and not necessarily one, nor attributable to a particular         body. Thinking about the gendered subjectivity, performative genderings,         styles of femaleness or maleness or sexualities in artworks, thinking         about ideological attitudes to gender of any individual author is not         the only use of feminist criticism. Nor does critical work interested         in gender have to valorize any specific position, theme, rhetoric, or         finding. What does this mean? To maintain feminist (or gender-alert) RECEPTION         is crucial, not to insist that certain forms, styles, strategies, subjectivitities,         themes are more female, feminine, male, masculine, gay, straight on the         level of <i>production</i>. The feminism of <i>reception</i> means a high         level of analysis making legible gender materials and the materials of         other social matrices, and showing a subtle alertness to the play of gender         (etc.) and its deep structures, in culture, everywhere. Gender-alert,         materialist-inflected <i>reception</i> is interested in the discussion         of social location not only of artists, but of genres, discourses, images,         textualities, ideologies, communities.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is clear&#150;and         Perloff's paper makes this clear again, that gender is hardly "the only"         social factor to analyze in any discussion of culture. Rhetorics do not         "follow" in any easily traceable way, from social location, but, via praxis,         they do get conventionally linked to social location, and set in debate         and contestation there. This is fascinating to trace: what rhetoric seems         to "go" with what group is a convention. Why a community might choose         specific rhetorics or genres for certain functions is something criticially         to examine. Discourses, rhetorics, and conventions are forms of social         learning, sometimes involving will, choice, intention of the artist, sometimes         involving a consideration of stakes and social matrices already established.         For an example of engaged social learning, we have the testimony of Harryette         Mullen that she had to assimilate&#150;that is, to investigate and learn,         the identification she chose with African American folk, blues, rock'n'roll,         and popular, vernacular materials, in the sound mixage she produces so         elegantly, so intelligently in <i>Muse and</i> <i>Drudge</i>. One chooses         or enacts rhetorics as forms of social relationship, social declaration         and identification.The important question is how these rhetorics are USED         by writers as agents of choice and of discursive channelling (with what         ideology and intention surrounding the rhetorics) and how they are PERCEIVED         by critics (with what ideology and intention surrounding the reception),         not whether certain rhetorics are <i>ipso facto </i>more female, or more         innovative, which they are not...</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">....I confess still         to being baffled that both "Lyric Tradition and Language Poetry" are,         in the title of the conference, set syntactically under the rubric of         "innovation." It is still hard for me to empty out the word "innovation"         so that any recursive poetries are taken under that rubric; this is because         for me, to win the name of "innovation," a work has to be critical, oppositional,         in itself structured against a hegemony that it self-consciously names.         No rhetoric is separable from its uses.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(back         to top)</font></a></font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BIO</b>: Rachel         Blau DuPlessis's chapbook, <i>Renga: Draft 32</i> , (Beautiful Swimmer         Press) is recently published, in company with <i>The Feminist Memoir Project:         Voices from Women's Liberation</i>, edited by DuPlessis and Ann Snitow,         (Crown) and <i>The Objectivist Nexus: Essays in Cultural Poetics</i> ,         edited by DuPlessis and Peter Quartermain, (University of Alabama Press,         1999).
