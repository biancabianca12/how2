In a place called &quot;innovation.&quot;         That settled, we might confer toward determining what innovation looks         like via <i>where</i> it is located: to draw some lines, so to speak,         as a boundary? Around as a sort of embrace? As a grid of the relations         between lyric tradition and language poetry? Having many passionate poets,         readers of poetry, editors and critics in the room, this would be an arduous         task, which ardor was played out at various interesting moments, in various         tones and on various visages. Marvelous receptions, readings, and roundtables         were scheduled around panels; energies were constantly in flux, ideas         diffused, digested&#150;but rarely deployed.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">That poets of the         Lyric and Language Poetry Traditions were different enough (appreciatively         so); that most weren&#146;t there to invent new differences was clear         enough. But having been set up to meet, and perhaps since this was a first         meeting, the arrayed poets preferred to discover samenesses in what they         feel poetry to be, rather than discuss difference. Or &quot;Invent difference,&quot;         even for the sake of argument, or as a way to invent new, innovative possibilities.         One decisive moment was Friday&#146;s Roundtable Discussion with Rae Armantrout,         Lucie Brock-Broido, Jorie Graham, Barbara Guest, Lyn Hejinian, Brenda         Hillman, Ann Lauterbach, and Harryette Mullen, moderated by Elizabeth         Frost, which left many members of the audience with defeated expectations.         The roundtable response, a sort of remarkably polite consensus, to two         particularly provocative audience-member questions, bespoke this. The         first: Ann Lauterbach&#146;s response to Mary Margaret Sloan, editor of         <i>Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women</i>, who         requested that the panelists discuss points of difference, as per, in         part, the different tradition each has worked in/out of/through. Lauterbach         replied, &quot;Language poetry, that moment happened quite a while ago.         It&#146;s not that we want to be polite, but that the points of disagreement         are now less under contention and more something like absorbed,&quot;         to which Sloan disagreed, clearly hoping for less complacency among panel         members. The second, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, asked the panel if they&#146;d         be willing to speak to how, in the spirit of the conference, the fact         of gender had intervened in the dissemination and reception of their work,         and someone responded &quot;We&#146;d prefer not to speak of gender,&quot;         and no one dissented.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To be fair, Keynote         Speaker Marjorie Perloff made a major push, pointing out that we&#146;d         all been &quot;polite&quot; and then proceeding to &quot;pick&quot; on         a particular poet whose language she found &quot;lame,&quot; rhythms &quot;ugly&quot;&#150;as         well as urging for writing along the lines of poetics that was not merely         of the &quot;what I believe poetry to be&quot; sort, calling for poets         to do more work theoretically, and calling for more reviews of contemporary         poetry.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Aside from what seemed         rather settled or to have come, on that weekend, to some sort of settlement,         the conference raised among other things the issue of possibility, via         those titular notions &quot;meeting&quot; and &quot;innovation.&quot;         But this particular meeting suggested this one possible innovation: that         the notion of poetic &quot;possibility&quot; has been run aground, i.e.         the innovative/experimental imperative to &quot;make possible&quot; via         non-normative methods (abstract lyricism, disjunction, challenging subjectivity,         etc.) has come to an impasse. The form of several presentations served         to confirm this, making a case for Ms. Poet X as innovative because she         exhibited qualities a, g, and m and challenged notions 3p and 6t, while         gesturing toward the possibility of z9627r. As though the possible were         thoroughly &quot;exhausted,&quot; as in tired, at rest, can&#146;t go         on, mapped out <i>not only</i> as a potential, but as an actuality. And         as though conference attendees were, well, not wishing to be polite, but         suffering from absorption. Shouldn&#146;t we agree also on the terms?         Or rather, argue over them? So surely locked in lexicons are we really         onto possibilities after all? Or merely options? On the syllabus for CW680,         for week 9, we&#146;ll compare possibility as a convention and as a potential,         and then discuss the potential as a convention. Go to the zoo and write         a sonnet or do a chance operation on three different brands of alphabet         soup. Isn&#146;t possibility all about including as many things as possible         after all?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The merest semantic         shift brings about new conceptual ground. Why not dwell in probability?         What is it to open the field of the probable? How does that resonate with         the openness poems have? It seems more valuable and more &#145;open,&#146;         less authoritative ( <i>i.e.</i> having to do less with the self than         with the shifting field in which one operates) to work towards making         things probable. Yet it implies perhaps some necessary discipline, that         the realm of the probable is slightly &quot;smaller&quot; or more determined         than the possible &#151; after all, anything&#146;s possible, but only         when something is considered it is probable or it is not. Discipline &#151;         eventually one must choose one route of all possible ways, and one chooses,         most likely, the most possible, so that it seems the possible is a subset         of the probable, and so that moving towards the probable is opening onto         new ground. Rather than spreading difference perhaps &#145;an otherness         that is imagining&#146; (Duncan).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">[For a fuller, more         candid account of the proceedings, see Linda Russo and Logan Esdale&#146;s         collaborative response, &quot;A Barnard Report&quot; in the archive of         </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">SUNY-<a href="http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html">Buffalo&#146;s         Poetics List</a>, 4/19/99.]</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(back         to top)</font></a></font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BIO</b>: Linda         Russo's poems were recently published in Potes &amp; Poets Press New Chapbook         Series.
