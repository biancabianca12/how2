But diverseinfluences came roiling through me in a necessarily genre-blurring workwherea reading of Bakhtin (how wrong he was about the lack of the dialogic inpoetry!) mixed with Williams'<I>Paterson</I> and James'<I>The Sacred Fount</I> andturned back towards the feminine, indeed the maternal: the books my motherandI had read together, even though in separate rooms, those piles of librarybooks knee deep by the side of each bed (the site of the guilty pleasure:reading...because it was selfish...). I speak, of course, if I speak (andstill I feel--more so than with the dirty laundry of any meredisfunctionality--guilty, when I speak) of Renault, Stewart, Whitney,Heyer:novels with thinly clad women on their well-protected dust jackets, out insome storm in the middle of the night at the base of sheer cliffs on whichacastle...--etc.. Oh yes, Radcliff, oh, yes, "Monk" Lewis, but I was goingbackto those modern gothics Tania Modleski differentiates from Harlequinromancesby just this much: "the Harlequin heroine's feelings undergo atransformationfrom fear into love, whereas for the Gothic heroine the transformation isfromlove to fear." (<I>Loving with a Vengence</I> p.60) From love to fear and outagain, and in again and out again and whew: a familliar story. It works, asthey say, by breaking down. The failure of narrative (the narrative of thefamily just for starters) interested me, intensely, personally: I'd come topoetry as a site (articulated audibly for me first by Plath) of resistancetothe social (cultural as well as familial) narratives in which women playedsuch silent, terrified, confused and endangered roles, a site at whichLyotard's announcement of the end of the grand narratives came as a note ofhope, for it was--as I more and more realized--not my house which wascomingdown, and just might come more obviously down if I stopped participating inall the rituals that helped to prop it up. It: "illusions of ordercongealedby fear" (Taussig,<I>The Nervous System</I>). Well out of it for a little whileIbecame its entrance and exit, its wind tunnel, its open door: an apertureforwhat horror had, in a mutitude of tongues, to tell--and toll as stillunspeakable.<HR><H3><I>from</I> The Tales of Horror</H3><H4>by Laura  Mullen</H4><BR><BR><NOBR>She touches me and takes her hand away abruptly, it's so clear that there is no one there.</NOBR><BR><NOBR>"But it's always been like that!" Nervous laughter. The picture</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Of a headless man falling headlong hangs at the head of the stairs.</NOBR><BR><NOBR>"Why I must have been dreaming!" All this in the tone of one</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Who desires to convince himself or herself. The maroon silk smoking jacket, the yawn,</NOBR><BR><NOBR>The fists rubbed into the eyes. Sensuous detail is wonderful, wonderful,</NOBR><BR><NOBR>But when the sheets twist themselves up into that slug-like form</NOBR><BR><NOBR>In the sticky moonlight, becoming a lady who goes for the throat,</NOBR><BR><NOBR>I check out of this hotel, apartment in a crumbling villa, mansion that no one...</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Et cetera. "I won't stay another minute, I tell you!" Fireworks.</NOBR><BR><NOBR>And if the marriage breaks up it's the fault of the house (the body</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Goes out on a stretcher). "I tell you it's the same woman after all this time!"</NOBR><BR><NOBR>There is a shocked gasp perhaps? Could you give us a, ah, yes--</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Thought that was your tongue, no need to worry about that any longer.</NOBR><BR><NOBR>"I say old chap, it didn't seem to you, for an instant, did it, that that <I>choir</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Of summer insects </I> was doing Verdi?" "On the contrary...." You have to wonder</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Why he didn't just donate the goddamned (whoops, literally) thing to a Museum.</NOBR><BR><NOBR>He put his head in his hands. "May I make a suggestion?" "We shall have to</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Arm ourselves carefully for this deed!" <I>And in fact he would not have lived</NOBR><BR><NOBR>If we hadn't moved him here. </I> The thing, with a piercing shriek of unearthly laughter</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Fled away. "Why it's been 'to let' forever...." You can tell that a beautiful</NOBR><BR><NOBR>But evil woman once lived here. Well the house was thick with terror. ("I say,</NOBR><BR><NOBR>What is this goop on the stairs?") Let's have another, shall we? I don't think</NOBR><BR><NOBR>I could bear to be left alone just yet. I don't think I can stay here.</NOBR><BR><NOBR>These candles have a habit of going out. Ah yes, here's that little something</NOBR><BR><NOBR>I've been telling you about. There, do you see that? And it's headed</NOBR><BR><NOBR>In our direction. "Why, I would have sworn they...no, I'd better not have another--</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Preposterous!...that those birds and insects (in the tall grasses and green-</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Leaved trees at the beginning of summer) were producing a most sophisticated</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Tune." Shaking his head as if to clear it. Gentle, slightly amused</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Laughter, "in fact, I think I'll just turn in." Things are bound to look better</NOBR><BR><NOBR>In the morning. (I believe you can shed a little light on this professor!)</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Nothing simpler. The marks of teeth at the throat. But humming to himself</NOBR><BR><NOBR>As he went back upstairs. Have you seen it? No, but I felt something, I distinctly</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Felt some, as it were, breath of.... Yes, exactly: now you know I'm not mad.</NOBR><BR><NOBR>I was just so grateful to find lodgings I could finally afford! As though her hand</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Had frozen at the touch of my shoulder, she quickly took it--stiffened as though</NOBR><BR><NOBR>Around an invisible...--away. Voices, voices, out of the walls</NOBR><BR><NOBR>And the ceilings and floors. And then nothing stays where you put it.</NOBR><BR><NOBR>"Why I would'na live thar sur fra hunert pound!" No Bill, nor I either--</NOBR><BR><NOBR>This said kindly (condescendingly). "Tip him," this hissed out from, no doubt,</NOBR><BR><NOBR>The Collective Unconscious. It had an unpromising aspect, but my funds were low,</NOBR><BR><NOBR>And I wasn't, I told myself, lifting my head, one to be easily frightened.</NOBR><BR><NOBR>"Just put those boxes down anywhere." And your name? <I>Burning eyes, eyes like.... </I> </NOBR><BR><NOBR>Ah yes, my name. I checked the mirror quickly, expecting--I'll admit it--</NOBR><BR><NOBR>To find only one of us there.</NOBR><BR><BR><NOBR></NOBR><BR><BR><NOBR></NOBR><BR><HR><B>Bio: </B> Laura Mullen is the author of <I>The Surface</I> (U.
