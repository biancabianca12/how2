</font></B><P><FONT FACE="Times"><B>Working Notes:</b></font><FONT FACE="Times">  "Disaster Services" was written in response to my strong reactions to Francis Bacon's paintings. They horrify me, but there is also a calm in them, arising from  his formal qualities as with the spaciousness of the large color planes. He works with the tension between containment and holes. In my poem I show how the family as a formal structure can be functioning on one level, and at the same time, leaking into despair. </font></P><FONT FACE="Times">
