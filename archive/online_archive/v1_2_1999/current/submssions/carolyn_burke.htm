<P>Mina Loy's life is the stuff of drama.  Given her expatriate experience, participation in the radical art movements of the early twentieth century, and romance with the boxer/poet Arthur Cravan, it is not surprising that her life has been recast in a work of fiction.  It is disturbing to note, however, that Antonia Logue's novel <U>Shadow-Box</U> (Bloomsbury, Grove/Atlantic, 1999) relies heavily on my biography <U>Becoming Modern, The Life of Mina Loy</U> (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1996)--not only for historical facts but also for overarching themes, treatment and interpretation of cultural milieux, and in some cases, narrative structures.  A comparison of the two books shows that while Logue sought to transform this material, her novel piggy-backs on my work, often interweaving innovative parts of the biography and presenting them as "fact."</P>
<P>On Logue's behalf one could argue that since the publication of <U>Becoming Modern</U> Mina Loy's life has entered the public domain.  Judging by the stares of non-recognition that still greet me in bookshops, however, such a claim is misleading.  When I began work on the biography twenty years ago, she had been so thoroughly forgotten that most people thought I was writing about the film star.  Since its publication critics have recognized <U>Becoming Modern</U> as the definitive work on Loy.  As such it has a different status from lives of figures like Gertrude Stein, Hemingway, or Pound, about whom new biographies are written every decade: for this reason Logue's appropriations are all the more salient.</P>
<P>Moreover, although she does credit <U>Becoming Modern</U> as one of two "outstanding sources," this acknowledgement is misleading.  It suggests only a partial recognition of a much greater indebtedness and could be thought to imply some form of cooperation on my part.  While Logue appears to have done no original research into the life of Mina Loy, relying entirely upon the biography, I was never asked to lend my support to her project.</P>
<P>Excerpts from recent reviews of <U>Shadow-Box</U> demonstrate the extent and nature of the appropriations:</P>
<U><P>thematic</U>:</P>
<P>--the biography's major themes reappear as those of the novel: "the conflicting forces at work in the first decades of the century; the dynamism and energy of new movements in art and thought, as opposed to the left-over Victorian propriety that traps the talented, intelligent Mina in an early loveless marriage; forward-looking New York, where her first poems are published and appreciated, versus stuck-in-the-past Europe" (<U>Literary Review</U>)</P>
<U><P>intellectual and cultural milieux &amp; forms:</P>
</U><P>-- While the biography is what made it possible for Logue to evoke the lively artistic backgrounds, from Post-Impressionism to Futurism and Dada, not to mention Loy's lovers and friends like Marinetti, Duchamp, and Picabia, she is credited with original portrayals of "the intellectual excitement and controversy surrounding the arts in the pre-WWI period," even with creating "witty and illuminating" glimpses of the period's luminaries (<U>Kirkus</U>)--the details of which derive from my treatment of these movements and figures.</P>
<P>&#9;<U>some uses of specific details, settings, and structures:</U> </P>
<P>To demonstrate the nature of Logue's borrowing, readers should compare the following sections of each work:</P>
<U><P>Shadow-Box</U>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;<U>Becoming Modern</P>

</U><P>pp. 28: Mina walking Oda in&#9;&#9;&#9;p. 96: detail based on my</P>
<P>Luxembourg Gardens&#9;&#9;&#9;experience, inserted for&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;verisimilitude</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;fragmentary evidence</P>

<P>pp. 95-98: presentation of&#9;&#9;&#9;pp. 151-153:  original &#9;&#9;&#9;material on Frances Stevens and&#9;&#9;&#9;research, interpretation,</P>
<P>Italian Futurists&#9;&#9;&#9;and staging of scenes</P>

<P>pp. 110-111: Marinetti's trip to&#9;&#9;&#9;pp. 171-172:  "invention" of</P>

<P>pp. 161-163: scene of Cravan&#9;&#9;&#9;pp. 263-265:  interpretation</P>
<P>leaving Salina Cruz&#9;&#9;&#9;and staging of material woven</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;from diverse sources</P>

<P>pp. 168-176: Loy at Arensbergs',&#9;&#9;&#9;pp. 212-223:  interpretation </P>
<P>relations with Duchamp, Williams,&#9;&#9;&amp; treatment of this group &amp; </P>
<P>New York Dada&#9;&#9;&#9;individuals including details&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;of badinage with Duchamp</P>

<P>pp. 177-200: Cravan, Independents&#9;&#9;pp.  223-233, 234-251, details,</P>
<P>structured in two parts, with Cravan story&#9;interpretations &amp; narrative &#9;&#9;starting on p. 182&#9;&#9;&#9;device of highlighting Cravan</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;story (my Ch. 11)&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>pp. 263-267: Salina Cruz scene, details&#9;&#9;pp. pp. 263-265, recreation &#9;&#9;of boat, communication system, role&#9;&#9;of Cravan's fate from disparate</P>
<P>of Bob Brown&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;sources including Brown </P>
<P>Given my response to these uses of my biography, it is for someone else to judge <U>Shadow-Box</U>.  Others will decide whether it transforms the biographical materials or whether it remains a derivative work.</P>
<P>It would also be instructive to compare Logue's novel with Albert Guerard's <U>The Hotel in the Jungle</U> (Baskerville, 1996), a work of imaginative fiction composed before my book appeared and based on what was then known of the Loy/Cravan story.  Guerard made the legend his own by creating a setting for their romance (the hotel) and a group of characters who retrospectively piece together their story.</P>
<P>While it is a pleasure to see novelists' creative transformations of historical material (and there are many successful examples), Logue's raises serious questions about literary method and publishing ethics.  Caveat lector! </P>
