Dear Roberta,

Sorry for the addle-brained message Kathleen and I sent. We got nervous and 
went on too long. Kathleen and I went over the site and she is typing up 
corrections etc. I hope they don't drive you crazy, please tell me, when 
things settle down, how I can make this whole process easier—I will 
definitely rewrite the "guides" to make things clearer and K. and I will try 
to think of other things to make it better. Thanks again for being so kind.

I'm afraid I have another bio change. This one is from Linda Russo (who is in 
"alerts"). Sorry. They are a temperamental lot.

BIO:  Linda Russo lives in Buffalo, New York.  She is the author of _o going
out_ (Potes & Poets Press).

Kathleen has straightened things out with Elena and I think Kathleen will 
send you the corrections tomorrow.

My guy, Jeff says that I can download something off the internet (BBEdit) 
which might allow me to make formatting changes. Is this true, if so I could 
help out. Let me know.

best,
Jo Ann
