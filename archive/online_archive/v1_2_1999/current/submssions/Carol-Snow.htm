<P>Working Notes:</B>  "News Of" and "News Of: Codicils" comprise the first section of <I>For</I>.  The "Codicils" (this is a term for addenda to a legal document) have appeared in the letterpress chapbook <I>Breath As: Short Poems</I> and in <I>Colorado Review</I> (ah, Colorado), but never yet with their "News Of."  That poem was written in December 1989 after the gunning down of seven(?) women on a Canadian college campus, it could not resolve (me) -- though as accountant daughter of a C.P.A., I fancied the use of 'reconciled' -- and the</P>
<P>"Codicils" followed, written and assembled -- some were extracts from longer poems -- more slowly.  Of course, the sections are arranged as a sequence.  But I also intended that any codicil section could be read separately in response to "News Of" (like a "Responsive Reading" in Temple), modifying it in a singular way.</P>
<P>        A new poem, "Uses of Italics" (out in the next <I>Five Fingers Review)</I>, tries to explain why the first line of each "Codicil" is italicized: as "musical reference" to the single-line stanzas opening/titling each of Mary Barnard's Sappho translations and (even more obscurely) to the sound of Responsive Readings themselves (or the Pledge of Allegiance, "Happy Birthday," etc.) -- a ragged, "vibrant" entrance until our many variations on assuredness and hesitation settle into one voice.</P>
<P>        I cannot speak to how often the "News Of" poems have new relevance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>another massacre; and the clean bright morning.</P>
<P>Keeping walking.  'Contradiction' is human -- I know that.</P>
<P>And 'knowing'...  A stirring from the place the whirlwind -- something like</P>
<P>fear -- arises, and watching my breath</P>

<P>to still that.  Suddenly thinking somewhere in the breath -- along</P>
<P>the breath, is an <I>understood</I> place.  Somewhere -- but somewhere</P>
<P>in passing -- where the matter is reconciled.</P>
