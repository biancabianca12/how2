<P>6/18/99 from Michele Leggott, re. the lost work of anti-modernist, Robin Hyde;  &amp; a response to screen- reading techniques</P>

<P>Dear Kathleen,</P>

<P>I'm doing the Collected Poems (I think I may have told you already), and Lisa Docherty* plans to go on to a Collected Letters. [*Lisa is one of my PhD students, also the exact type of research assistant you suggest as aid for my eyes, and a keen follower of HOW2.  Her thesis is on the Letters of Robin Hyde, and it is our combined mission to return Hyde to the international arena she had entered at the time of her death by suicide in London, August 1939 at the age of 33.]  Both projects provide ample ammunition for refocusing Hyde (real name Iris Wilkinson) away from the cultural nationalism she was conveniently boxed into for decades. She fits otherwise so well into paradigms of writing by twentieth-century women (feminist, championing, voiceless and oppressed, mythopoetic imagination) that the smaller frame is at this date ludicrous. The Hyde/HD paper I'm piloting at masters level begins to open the kind of parallels we want to make.  But Hyde's not a modernist. In fact, she reacted strongly against the British-derived modernism as it was installed here in the '30s by slightly younger, self-confident male contemporaries who were intent on erasing a Georgian/feminine/literary journalistic tradition that preceded them. Her early death made it possible for that hegemony to prevail unquestioned by a female critical voice or by poetry which was other than "hard clean lines" so dear to the hewers and cleavers of national identity narratives of the day.   So I'm sending you a copy of the long poem just published 62 years after it was written in 1937. It's called THE BOOK OF NADATH, and I am curious to know your reaction to it. I've argued long and hard. in the intro, for its importance as an alternative to just about everything else that was written here in the '30s. Am anxious now to send it out in the world to discover what parallels it may find with other kinds of prophetic writing....It would give me great pleasure to think that Robin Hyde might be read on the other side of the world again as the millennium turns over.</P>

<P>On Linda Russo's comments: I was of course very interested in the screen vs. hard copy observations. I thoroughly appreciate the argument for having a print copy in front of reading eyes but would also say this: because I have to read on-screen, I print only a fraction of what I encounter.  If I do print, it all has to be copied into files wherein I can hike the point size (minimum 16 points Arial; 28 if it's for reading to classes etc; uses forests of paper).  So I've become accustomed to thinking of the Net as a library I can get to anytime and browse in a way I can no longer browse a conventional library. I like scooting around in a site, picking up bits here and there. I like all the stuff archived there in cyberspace, quietly waiting to be got to by any and by all.  I will probably never read HOW2 "right through" because instead I will have tunneled around in it half a dozen times. I may miss something important, but if it's that important someone will tell me about it . . .    I think there's an argument for HOW2 staying rich and big in cyberspace, and us not panicking too much about failing to read everything, feet off the ground! The main thing might be to guide other readers in so the site is covered in activity from which conversations multiply. If they've found one thing there, they'll be back. The bookmark is already made that will flag them in.  Return is an idea to play with. </P>

<P>Well, best wishes from here.  (I'm waiting for them to develop a laptop with big foldout screen. Then I will have the perfect tool to carry about and get at everything I need in situ.  Hooray for that day.)</P>

<P>Michele</P>

<P>[Editor's note: Michele Leggott, our Editorial Advisory Board member from New Zealand, is partially sighted; thus, reading is a very strenuous task, with unusual time constraints. In the light of this, it is also interesting to read her responses to Linda Russo's comments (see full discussion of this in H2/n2,  "editor's notes &amp;") as an alternative that may express others' related needs as well.  However, in my mind we need not choose one or the other way of reading or browsing, but can work to make both the screen version and the printed-out hard copy as easy to access as possible...to have both capabilities, side-by-side.

<P>June 2, 1999/ from Linda Russo re. HOW2 browse/ability problems</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  ....First of all I think your idea to publish 2 issues per year is sensible.  I initially thought the first issue was too large, but probably this is more of a "virtual" problem than an "actual" problem(??).  I can't stand to read things on the screen, and need to print things up to really consider them.  And for as much convenience as the web affords, I like to HAVE the thing, have it lying around, read it, show it to people who come over....If it seems too big I think this has to do with the "lack" of browseability in the way it's set up, which the hard copy introduces-i.e. that of being able to see it all in any order at one time.  This is absent from the web version, in part because of the layout: each item sits somewhat separately.  There are links of course, but the items seem discontinuous and the links are uni-directional in a way. This might also address the issue of formality-there is an "official" entry to sections to which the table of contents is a "master plan" and with the links further relegating those possibilities.  Again we are faced with the issue that Alice Notley raises (if one wants to gender the issue) that we live in a "man-made" world, that the "journal" itself is a "man-made" form.  Does it need to be re-imagined?  Or is this one of the pitfalls of living in space, which is time (or vice versa)?   The link-format presents a related problem in printing, in that one must open every single item and press print, and some items lead to further items (e.g. Frances Jaffer's selection of poems. There are a few items I missed and have to go back and print)-an ominous task.  When one is not surrounded with campus computing resources-i.e. paper, toner, a laser printer, limitless on-line time-this can be daunting, economically and technologically.  Lacking these resources one might not print up the issue at all.   I do think we should encourage people to think of HOW2 as "an issue" and not just a collection of parts, as printworthy and not mere cyber ephemera or pastime, and I think the design could encourage this.  One way to do so is to have a scrolling format-all items link from the table of contents and with different subsections but themselves compose one long document (in the order presented in the table of contents), in the way that the "Sections" scrolls,  for example, hit print once.  This arrangement also saves paper as it allows for the whole to be double-sided, eliminating those lone pages incurred in odd page-numbered items....  Is there some way to make it printable with some sort of "print the whole thing" button/command?  In choosing scrolls over links you lose some of the neat hypertext embeddedness (its feminine quality?) which increases the sense of depth, but it is here, in the case of Frances Jaffer's poems, that things get overlooked-or are easy to overlook.  When browsing, one at least  has to look before one can overlook.  Poetry, as a visual-linguistic medium, seems particularly dependent on this condition. Yet it's into the pockets (or is it the seams?) of (homosocial) discourse that women do get pushed...and lost. Perhaps we are still "leveling the field"-as much as we'd like to think we're post-feminist!-and we might think of HOW2 as a textual analogue of the work to be done to increase visibility in the larger (textual) world. Other than this user-convenience issue, the website is really well done, a really nice design with some happy little neat cyber-tidbits (bells &amp; whistles so to speak) going on.</P>

<P>Rome/  June 3, 1999</P>

<P>Dear Linda,</P>

<P>Thank you for taking the time to write down your thoughts-as reflected in precise technological terms for this particular journal &amp; the electronic medium, generally-and for reviewing options available to us as we think into future issues of HOW2.  I'll immediately FORWARD your suggested "browseability" options to our new webmaster, Roberta Sims, at Bucknell University. She is just beginning to actively engage with the overall design process, having inherited the design of n1 from Stan Friedman, the excellent designer provided by the Rutgers HOW(ever) archive project. As we think towards issue n2, Roberta has already come up with some great ideas in response to our need for a visually livelier entry page (splash page) as a gate to the rest of the journal/archives/etc. Roberta has developed visual design changes that you will soon find incorporated into the home page &amp; section introductions of the current issue and throughout issue n2. Your problems and possible solutions for making the actual "browsing " easier are related to the actual engineering design and I would guess that if it can be done, Roberta can do it.   Regarding the original design of HOW2 following the "man-made" template, which Alice Notley speaks of, I'm not too worried about this since we are very spontaneous and fluidly-inclined around here, and quite open to anything that can help the reader to take in the work.  While our Table of Contents may derive from a "master plan," it was put there as a useful tool to consult &amp; guide the reader through the overall picture, as well as to propose individual items a reader might have particular interest in pursuing-generally a good idea, in the way that certain kinds of books include useful indexes. The rest of the original design-visually-speaking-was encouraged by me as a first-time-out resemblance between the new electronic HOW2, &amp; its original in-print predecessor, HOW(ever)....just to reinforce that recognition of lineage. As of now, our tech support (including html translation and every aspect of visual and engineering design) is under the care Roberta Sims at Bucknell. I will take very seriously any concrete ideas that are put forth and will immediately forward them to RS.  I particularly loved your suggestion that HOW2 might be thought of as a "textual analogue of the work to be done to increase visibility in the larger (textual) world." This is a model to hang on to and continuously address.  I hope that you and your colleagues will be working on snippets, sentences, responses, collaborations coming out of your reading/s. Remember that in the "alerts" and "postcard" section, comments on other cultural events-as related to language and the innovative spirit-are very welcome (film, theater, visuals, dance, mixed (multi) media...as well as comments/descriptions from the more pedagogical arts of teaching and curriculum development and media use-especially where experiments have opened up a work of writing Please tell your poet/scholar friends and promising graduate students to send us things. This could be a first-and happy-chance for some of them. </P>

<P>May 29, 1999/ from Carla Harryman, re. the question of women claiming voice in public space</P>

<P>Dear Kathleen,</P>

<P>I have at last read all or almost all of HOW2.  It was deeply satisfying. And I was of course thrilled by the record of Jaffer's eloquent testimony to H.D. and the sample of her work.  It is a fine memorial.  The thread among the articles (other than modernism) is between the female author's relationship to history, literature, and the canon and the masculinist interpretations of aforesaid (and I'm thinking here about the themes of surrealism, classicism, objectivism, and the New York School) as controlling women's positionalities and products based on certain kinds of apriori investment.  The dialogue between the more extended articles is rich with common concerns.</P>

<P>I agree that the "forum" answers did not respond directly to your question and frankly, I think your question is key and I mean the one about public articulation.  I do not think that that form of publicness is necessarily equivalent to modes of domination.  Indeed, I think that I sometimes get myself in trouble, because I assume that such forums are based in a democratic ideal that is not about domination but about speaking to things that matter, challenges to norms, policies, intellectual assumptions.  My notion of "democracy" is neither about mass culture democracy in which "candidates" grandstand to get votes (and to control issues) with the rest of us looking on to cast ballots; nor is it about everybody taking turns in some kind of formulaic manner. It's about a public space that honors engaged discussion among the diversity of its participants.</P>

<P>The collectivity has a responsibility, I think, to make sure that those who have something to say are heard just as we, who because of our acculturation encounter difficulties speaking up, have a responsibility to the collectivity to voice our ideas, our critiques, our challenges.  If I did not feel this obligation, I would almost never attempt to speak in public. Throughout the history of feminism and modern progressive movements, this form of discussion has been practiced  and (to further state the obvious) women have often been the leaders and instigators of pubic discussions and political actions on all sorts of public issues.  I'm curious about this gap between intellectual discussion (which often seems to be about gate-keeping in the context of the contemporary literary culture we are engaged with) and this other side-by-side history.</P>

<P>In the meantime, I personally feel enormous hesitation to speak in these public contexts-more than I ever have.  I have attributed this to 1) the sense that whatever I say will be mistaken and 2) a great reticence to focus only on one point.  Both of these issues could be unpacked at some length.  For the time being, I just want to point out that I would like to have a better handle on the relationship of feminism and its powerful histories of effective public debate and political actions to this kind of abjection of public discourse in the recent conference you refer to in "editors notes &amp;."  Is there something not thought through about the relationship of feminism to entrenched political and academic norms of public discussion?  I do think there is a relationship between the common thread of the articles in the first issue mentioned above and my own anxieties about public discussion.</P>

<P>I am quite grateful that you have provided this beautifully organized space for publication and discussion.  I have never had the slightest desire to enter the list serve discussions, but your on-line journal is a whole other story.  I love that you have used the medium so well, such that there are substantial articles, works and thoughts in progress, poetry and art, quotes and commentary.</P>

<P>5/10/99, Marcella Durand--from St. Mark's Poetry Project to the Barnard College conference</P>

<P>Hi Jo Ann,</P>
<P>What a thrill to go all the way from downtown St. Mark's to uptown Barnard. Ah, legitimacy!  I didn't feel so much subversive, as practical.  I wanted to get into actual happenings, techniques, venues--solid matter--I wanted to fire up the audience (a mix of students, poets, &amp; publishers) to publish.  And not just publish, but be published.  We addressed the continuing problem of women releasing their work to be read, edited, spoken.  I felt satisfied that together as a panel we raised urgent and pertinent questions about poetic action: communities, institutions, reading series, publications. It was great to see male faces in both panels and audience, actively engaged, concerned.  The entire event had an energizing air of internationalism and urbanity.  Out of the ghetto into the polis.</P>

<P>4/27/99  Response to a reader enquiry regarding our policy on "excerpting"</P>

<P>HOW2 is not "against" publishing the complete text of anything, on principle... It's just becoming more and more evident that most people have a limited tolerance for screen reading time and while they can print out any single text, many don't have the home facilities to do that. So it seems to me that often there are one or several sections of a talk/essay that pertain more particularly to what HOW2 is focusing on...the excerpts, thusfar, have been selected in this way. We can always include a "link" or reference to where the complete text can be found, if it does exist in another location. Also the author can simply say "No" to excerpting. We always check out any excerpting proposal with her first.  But as to a single prescribed (correct?) way of doing things, this is exactly what we are trying to undermine-by inviting all sorts of "readings" and, in fact, constructing various places in HOW2 where shorter and longer/formal &amp; less formal speculations, reflections, partial findings can unfold.</P>

This issue also has an interesting debate on gender by Lisa Panting, writer and co-director of "Milch."  She affirms that women do need to debate gender and analyse the dominant aesthetic in the public arena.  She mentions mainstream women artists Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas who make work connected with the experience of "femaleness," but not as a continuation of feminist art history.</P>

<P>This issue features articles on the New Woman of the late 19c and early 20c.  In the context of HOW2, I wanted to draw attention to Ana I. Parejo Vadillo's article: "New woman poets and the culture of the salon at the fin de siecle."  To quote the abstract: "This paper looks at the space of the salon, and argues that the fin-de-siecle salon is a hybrid space between the privacy of writing and publicity of publication, and hence a crucial space for women poets."</P>

<P>"Raised as I have been with this century's Western notions of adversarial aesthetics, I continue to have difficulty in accommodating my latest articulation of the narrative "problem"--i.e., according to Teresa De Lauretis's conflation of narrativity itself with the Oedipus complex, whereby woman's position is constantly reinstated for the consummation or frustration of male desire.  The difficulty lies in accommodating this with a conviction that it is of the utmost urgency that women's voices, experience, and consciousness--at whatever stage--be expressed in all their multiplicity and heterogeneity, and in as many formats and styles--narrative or not. In relation to the various notions of an avant-garde, this latter view, in its emphasis on voicing what has previously gone unheard, gives priority to unmasking and reassessing social relations, rather than overturning previously validated aesthetic positions.  My personal accommodation becomes more feasible when cast in terms of difference rather than opposition, and when the question is asked: "Which strategies bring women together in recognition of their common and different economic and sexual oppressions and which strategies do not?" The creation of oppositional categories begs this question."</P>
