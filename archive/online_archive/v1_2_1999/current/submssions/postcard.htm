<P>Guerrilla tactics, Laura (Riding) Jackson: </P>
<P>an exchange between Jeanne Heuving &amp; Kathleen Fraser </P>
<P>.</P>
<P>June 14</P>
<P>Dear Jeanne, </P>
<P>I would love to hear more of what you meant in the quote (below), from your </P>
<P>last e-mail... </P>
<P>"However, feminism is being somewhat squashed in the academy, while </P>
<P>it makes steady advances in many other guises but its own name. So. . . </P>
<P>guerrilla tactics in all places are probably in order." </P>
<P>What are the "other guises" and why must they be in dis/guise....? It shows </P>
<P>the power--in this case, negative??--of a name. It's not that the needs of </P>
<P>female empowerment have been entirely met, I take it, since you suggest the </P>
<P>need for "guerrilla tactics"...I love the sound of "the Gorilla Girls" MORE </P>
<P>than the sound of "feminism," but I wonder if HOW2 has already gone beyond </P>
<P>that possibility by announcing its project right out in the open. I do </P>
<P>think there are women who are oddly fearful...if only of being thought of </P>
<P>as "dated" in their politics, thus not "sexy." What is/are the solutions to </P>
<P>this vexing conundrum? A real question to be thought about in HOW2.... </P>

<P>Dear Kathleen, </P>
<P>About my comments on feminism in the academy and guerrilla tactics, etc, I </P>
<P>suppose I am looking for a course of least resistance, while protesting </P>
<P>that this needs to be done in a sense. When I wrote that "feminism is </P>
<P>being somewhat squashed in the academy while it makes steady advances in </P>
<P>many other guises but its own name," I meant to say that in many ways </P>
<P>feminism is an unstoppable force--and many of its agendas--dismantling of </P>
<P>certain hierarchies and certain kinds of oppression--are now being carried </P>
<P>out under other banners, i.e. multiculturalism, postmodernism, and </P>
<P>postcolonlialism. So what to do with the misogyny that continues to make </P>
<P>feminism a bad word, discrediting and dishonoring the work of feminists? </P>
<P>While I will sometimes defend the name and defend feminists quite </P>
<P>directly, I often feel myself to be on the losing end of this approach. </P>
<P>So, I suppose when I put out guerrilla tactics as an answer, I am looking </P>
<P>to beat the anti-feminists at their own game, slipping the word feminism </P>
<P>in when it is least expected, and otherwise pushing forward many feminist </P>
<P>agendas. I don't want to get stuck in "their" misperceptions and </P>
<P>hostility to feminism, so rather than announce it, I suppose I sometimes </P>
<P>behave as if actions speak louder than words--which I believe they do--and </P>
<P>can run less danger of reinvoking the old specters. </P>

<P>Dear Jeanne, </P>
<P>Responding to the section in your paper on Laura (Riding) Jackson, I still </P>
<P>find it difficult to put together almost any poem by Riding and her theory </P>
<P>about it. I find her theorizing--and your brilliant comments on </P>
<P>it--fascinating, whereas her poem language seems evasive, the words heavily </P>
<P>inflected with abstraction and an overused 19th century poetical lexicon. </P>
<P>(I wish someone would take this on, analyze it....) ....</P>
<P>A selfish request: (only if you have the time...) I'd love it if you could </P>
<P>elaborate on your use of the word "mistakenly" and the statement that </P>
<P>follows (bottom of p.5): "While some critics have mistakenly seen (Riding) </P>
<P>Jackson's emphasis on the mind throughout her work as making her a </P>
<P>"philosophical poet," an epithet that L(R)J herself abjured, importantly </P>
<P>her emphasis on the mind is rather on what the mind enacts, its </P>
<P>intellectual judgements, and negations." Isn't that last phrase at least a </P>
<P>partial description of what philosophy does do?? I'm not trying to argue </P>
<P>here, but rather to get a fuller sense of what you mean to say...how you </P>
<P>are thinking about this. </P>

<P>July 7, 1999</P>
<P>Dear Kathleen, </P>
<P>...your point about how often L(R)J's poetic language is evasive, overused </P>
<P>19th century lexicon is one that needs to be taken head on, although I am </P>
<P>not sure what I would say about it right now.</P>
<P>I think that L(R)J didn't want to be considered a philosophical poet, for </P>
<P>she saw philosophy (perhaps somewhat wrongfully) as ruminative, not active </P>
<P>enough, not committed enough, as responsive to its own systematic ways of </P>
<P>thinking, rather than willing to make intuitive judgments. She has been </P>
<P>compared to Nietzsche, somewhat appropriately I think, but she hated this </P>
<P>comparison, as she hated all comparisons between herself and others. And, </P>
<P>I would say there is something finally rather singular about her, really </P>
<P>beyond comparison, so in this sense she is right, but overly viciously so?? </P>
<P>But who am I to mince how she feels about herself. </P>
