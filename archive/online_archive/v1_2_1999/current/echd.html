The stakes were high, involving nothing       less than the "direct transmission" of inheritance for what in Western Anglo-American       and European literary traditions often stood in for the highest examples       of valor, virtue and moral character. "H.D.," Gregory writes, "certainly       knew what she was up against in entering, even as an amateur, the domains       of traditional classicism . . . . She fully understood the violent discontinuities       within classical transmission, coming in part from the political and religious       biases: the gradual removal, even deliberate destruction, of manuscripts       (lyric/erotic poetry) thought to be indecent or heretical, the haunting       loss of all but a few poems and fragments from what appears to have been       a vital female poetic tradition." Against the guardians of the "pure" transmission,       Gregory argues, H.D. sought a more eclectic body of information from the       devalued Alexandrian line, with its inclusions of hermeticism, mystery religions,       ambiguous sexual identity and homosexual desire -- well-suited to elevating       the female figure as the source of spiritual energy and erotic presence       and desire. <BR>      <BR>      Again, Gregory: "As H.D. consciously shaped her role in the survival of       the classics, however, she imagined it as clearly marginal to the life of       letters as traditionally conceived and practiced, even by her fellow imagist       rebels, with their scorn for traditional scholarship. She saw her role in       terms of a subversive, erotic and visionary endeavor fundamentally challenging       the assumptions of classical transmission; or, in [Walter] Pater's terms,       she saw herself speaking from the "centrifugal" margins, against the Germanic       dominance of classical learning." In the midst of this academic and literary       war, H.D. developed her own specific hellenic tradition across the boundaries       of multiple sources to find a use for the materials quite unlike any one       else's. The great gift of Gregory's book is that now, with a scholar's help,       we are finally able to see the full range of her texts and, through Gregory's       guidance, to begin to understand the felt intensity of these references,       particularly in the early lyric work of <I>Sea Garden</I>, and in the later       refinement of understandings in Helen in Egypt. The founding editor of the       H.D. Newsletter in the mid-1980's as well as a full professor of classics       at the University of Dallas, Eileen Gregory takes on the challenge of revising       our understandings of H.D.'s work with an enormous command of classical       material matched with a writer's attention to the subtleties of H.D.'s poetic       line. "Until recently," Gregory writes, "critics have dismissed the classical       allusiveness in her poem as trivial or contrived, and the critical climate       has not existed in which her lyricism or her hellenism could be taken very       seriously." Weaving a web of multiple texts that stand outside the "whitened       marble" of traditional classicism, Gregory uses sources as diverse as William       Pater, Jonathan Culler, Robert Duncan and Euripides as critical tools to       approach more closely the intertextuality and hence, poetic intelligence,       underlying H.D.'s work. While the pioneering scholarship of Susan Stanford       Friedman has gone a long way in uncovering the "left-handed" sense of hermetic       and esoteric traditions which influenced H.D.'s entire body of work, no       other critic of H.D., except perhaps the poet Robert Duncan in his legendary       <I>The H.D. Book </I>or, later, the poet Diane Di Prima in her privately       printed <I>The Mysteries of Vision </I> (1988), has made the connection       between the early lyric and the harsh personal demands of the hermetic traditions       which were part of the more diverse and erotically-charged Alexandrian classical       transmission. Understanding poetic forms of hellenic inheritance as inside       a <I>felt</I> experience of vision, H.D. placed her work outside an academic       commodity culture and inside a "gift economy" in a circulation of exchange.       Her inheritance, then, was not a "bartering of word for word before a tribunal       of literary guardians" but an act of creative response and "reciprocation"       as "tribute to the original gift": a writing that could bear the weight       of vision.<BR>      <BR>      This insight of the oracular impulse of H.D.'s early lyric leads Gregory       toward what might be the most important contribution of this book to H.D.       scholarship as Gregory re-reads the early poetry through an understanding       of voice which re-casts the task of H.D.'s lyric as that of creating and       sustaining immediate presence. Gregory takes seriously "as its own quest"       that which is "often subsumed in another guise" of biographic information,       and, in so doing, complicates our previous critical understandings of H.D.'s       strategy of personally-inflected poetic "masks" by bringing her project,       particularly in<I> Sea Garden</I>, into a long line of transcendent lyric       associations. Reading Jonathan Culler's notions of the uses of the lyric       voice against her own readings of the early work, Gregory argues that H.D.'s       lyric voice occupies the "oblique and marginal" territory of a poet whose       own poems might (as Gregory describes the "fully engaged hermetic mage")       respond to and generate "the animation of the spiritual in things . . .       through sense and bodily desire." In this remarkable chapter, Gregory deepens       our understanding of H.D.'s work as a "deliberate affiliation with a wide       and diverse set of lyric predecessor and contemporaries, among which [her       work] makes its own very large claims for poetic presence through voice"       -- that is, for the poem's power to actually "make something happen." In       H.D.'s lyric, Gregory writes, the tradition of oracular and visionary poetry       marries "scientific precision . . . eroticism, and . . . mystical clairvoyance"       to enter the hidden matrix of the creative act, with its dark, occluded       shadows of absence and self-doubt as well as its shining white of crystal.       Whatever sparseness of voice is there, Gregory implies, is there in part       because of the poet's necessity to make of the larger project of writing       its own vehicle of enactment, and to follow, therefore, the demands of the       craft. This interpretation is a long way from the "disembodiment, depersonalization,       repression, flight [and] stasis" of the pure "crystalline" line with which       the poems of H.D.'s <I>Sea Garden</I> are often associated. "H.D.'s classicism       first attracted me to the study of her writing," Gregory writes, "but her       keen-edged heterodoxy, rebelliousness, and surprising strangeness have sustained       my fascination and compelled my labor." In situating this "surprising strangeness"       and "rebelliousness" within new readings, Gregory suggests H.D.'s work as       "an antinomian move against the stilled bodies of the Gods" -- the lifeless       perfection of classicism whose anti-presence constituted the return to cultural       traditions of "purity" that so engaged Pound and Eliot. The reference to       antinomianism is telling; like the earlier outlaws Ann Hutchinson and Emily       Dickinson, H.D. understood her work as outside the traditional readings,       either of source or of interpretation, and therefore fashioned a personal       language which vision alone recovered. H.D.'s early work, long considered       as of lesser value than the later, more discursive narrative work of <I>Trilogy</I>       or <I>Helen in Egypt,</I> is given new context by which we can read again       works with which we were once familiar. <BR>      <BR>      In the past, we have had precious few sympathetic guides to take us to the       select world of classical references in order to begin to read H.D.'s classical       intertextuality in all of its fullness; and now, with Eileen Gregory's book,       we are, quite simply, allowed entrance. Listening to the poets and theoreticians       but never obscuring her arguments with pseudo-linguistics of any kind, Gregory       offers a sophisticated and highly learned interpretation for material which       many of us thought we already knew. Her own original thinking on these matters       and her considerable control of scholarly materials presents in such an       engaging prose as to make the reading of this book an open invitation for       others to enter. I wish her as wide and generous a readership as this book       deserves.<BR>      <BR>      --Eileen O Malley Callahan <BR>      <BR>      <HR>      <B>Bio:</B> Eileen O Malley Callahan has worked in the book business all       her life as a poet, printer, editor, publisher and graphic designer, working       with a variety of small presses and little magazines.
