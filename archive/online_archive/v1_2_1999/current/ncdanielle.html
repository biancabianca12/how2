&nbsp; &nbsp;the boy in blue -- on a hook hung from the balcony of       the house at one corner<BR>      of the square -- and the Germans all over -- the hook -- the garden -- the<BR>      entry -- the doorway with masses of red fuschias -- garden masses of apples       --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;one evening in the "house in back" eating pink rat poison       and shrieking --<BR>      terror --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;flowers -- frost on the window -- feet warming at the       stove -- scorched<BR>      socks -- after school--<BR>      &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;tranquility -- very rare peacefulness - after days of       emptiness -- empty<BR>      enough to put off getting up -- because of the emptiness itself -- and after<BR>      -- completely futile efforts to fill in --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;why despite appearances I go to such lengths to achieve       this feeling<BR>      emptiness -- of discomfort -- as though every gesture --every movement were<BR>      bringing me nearer to death --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the sensation of emptiness disappeared in that orgasmic       moment --<BR>      <BR>      <BR>      <HR>      <BR>      <BR>      <BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have possibly never been so far into that solitude       as these last months --<BR>      it still might not be enough -- there is a vague form of stability left       here<BR>      -- of security -- some doubt about what I can stand --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;more wandering -- add leaving the country -- breaking       all bonds -- or<BR>      whatever -- being broke in a country I don't know -- maybe --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;probably an illusion -- equating being alone in a room       for days -- and going<BR>      off somewhere --<BR>      <BR>      <BR>      April<BR>      <BR>      &nbsp;

-- seated on matting       -- they're playing cards --the<BR>      patron sitting on a chair by the stove closes his eyes -- head thrown back       a<BR>      little -- he is tall and lean -- looks high as a kite -- they aren't paying<BR>      any attention to me -- I'm fine here -- it's raining out -- sound of rain       on<BR>      the steps --<BR>      <BR>      <BR>      <HR>      <BR>      <BR>      &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;why such tenderness in his gestures -- after -- where       there is usually<BR>      distance --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;don't be taken in by tenderness -- protect yourself       from it -- I'm sucked in<BR>      too easily -- his presence I already live too much in these days -- not       enough<BR>      resistance now -- or irony --<BR>      <BR>      <BR>      December<BR>      <BR>      &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;tonight calm at last -- window open -- a little wind       -- gentle -- feeling my<BR>      bathrobe -- music below -- I just picked up K.'s journal -- always the way       to<BR>      get back to work when it's not happening -- Kafka or Beckett -- to start       up<BR>      again --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nothing is finished -- the problem hasn't been resolved       -- but I'm at the end<BR>      of my rope -- still struggling with it -- because it would be easier to       keep<BR>      going with them than pick up my life where it left off --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;these months speak years -- many new things -- to be       completely current with<BR>      present events -- living the news as it happens -- with no time lag -- now<BR>      it's difficult to become nothing but a spectator again --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what counted was the immediate -- objective justification       was impossible --<BR>      for what I was doing -- theoretical questions useless -- when I make theory<BR>      for others -- I end up not believing it -- immediate action justified<BR>      immediately in its entirety -- uncomfortable position but real --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for months no writing -- impossible to reconcile the       two --<BR>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;walk paying attention -- I've lost sensation -- closeness       of the outside<BR>      world around me -- I'm not connecting with things any more -- could be<BR>      irreparable loss -- trying now to recover sensations -- objects for instance<BR>      -- the table's smoothness -- its color -- my hand on the paper --<BR>      &nbsp;
