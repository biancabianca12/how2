Why<I>don't </I> they engage?<BR><BR>Innovative writing is not readily accessible because it does not useconventional interior mapping strategies.  It is new maps, and new mapsare hard to read. (Remember your first attempts at mapping yourchildhood neighborhood from above? At interpreting a topographical map?)<BR><BR>The reader must take time, and expend effort, trusting that theauthor/mapmaker actually has something to reveal.<BR><BR>The crux: can I take this strange author seriously? Is there a realworld, a terrain worth mapping, in the map? Is there anything at allbeneath the surface? Will my effort be worthwhile?<BR><BR>Or is this a clever hoax? Written by someone with a strange style but nosubstance? Am I being fooled? If I write about it, will I look foolish?<BR><BR>"The map is not the territory." But without trusting the map, we maynever see the living terrain.<BR><BR><BR><HR><B>Bio: </B> Madeline Sunley is a visual artist and manages a bookstore in SanFrancisco.
