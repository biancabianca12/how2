Whats of particular interest to me is how         so often &quot;justice&quot; comes down to issues of grammar. For a while         now Ive been receiving summaries (via email) of Supreme Court decisions         through the Legal Information Institute at the Cornell Law School. In         the work below, Ive chosen cases where language rules obviously held         the key to some of the decision making. I then asserted my own version         of the rule on the summary itself.

The group drove         from Texas to New Jersey to New York to Maryland, taking Avendano with         them. Respondent took possession of a revolver in Maryland and threatened         to kill Avendano. Avendano eventually escaped and called police, who arrested         respondent and the others. Respondent was charged in a New Jersey District         Court with, inter alia, using and carrying a firearm in relation to Avendanos         kidnapping, in violation of 18 U.S.C. sect. 924(c)(1). He moved to dismiss         that count, arguing that venue was proper only in Maryland, the only place         where the Government had proved he had actually used a gun. The court         denied the motion, and respondent was convicted of the sect. 923(c)(1)         offense. The Third Circuit reversed. After applying what it called the         &quot;verb test,&quot; it determined that venue was proper only in the         district where a defendant actually uses or carries a firearm.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Procedure: The         Verb Test<br>        NITE SATES (MORE Venn diagrams)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Chatter the embers,         you must cut off the arc.

Letters are actually what         sew the &quot;seam,&quot; and what they enclose is the dead body in its         emerald "spot." What is equally interesting is the apparent discarding         of the dash. Thus, the poem has a squarer look to it -- a plain, a plot,         a field. The more defined/geometric the space, the more it resembles a         space enclosed. The dashes signify an opening, but this poem has a concrete         and pictorial surface, patched in places by the letter "X". There's a         confession that links a man's name to a body beneath a field of X's. The         man attempts to remove his name from the penalty box. He wants to become         the X, the blank spot. The court eventually agrees to this, but the mark         is still there. The X is both an absence and a presence.</font></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="147" height="202" valign="top"></td>    <td height="202" colspan="10" valign="top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">       <a href="#top">(back to top)</a> </font>       <p>       </p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Times"><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">BIO:</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">         Jena Osman is the co-editor of Chain magazine <a href="../../update.html">(see         up dates section)</a> along with Juliana Spahr.
