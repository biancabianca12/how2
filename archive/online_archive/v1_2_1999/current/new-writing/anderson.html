        on poems by Beth Anderson</b><br>
        <i>In Residence</i> is a cycle of twelve poems. The project was initiated 
        on a manual typewriter one autumn when the prospect of moving loomed large 
        and nearly definite, when my professional obligations loomed equally large 
        and very definite, and when I had finished rereading Williams&#8217;s <i>Kora 
        in Hell</i>. I took as my model Williams&#8217;s writing process as he describes 
        it in his introduction to <i>Kora</i>; he wrote every night for a year 
        no matter the circumstances and revised the results into the poem. My 
        typewriter gave the act of writing a physicality that meshed with the 
        concerns of the writing; throughout the cycle place and replacement recur, 
        generated by motifs of structure and structuring, buildings and building. 
        <i>In Residence</i> was completed some months prior to my move and before 
        I knew where that move would land me, so the poems are acts of anticipation. 
        Their descriptions of place imagine the hunt for it, the method of finding 
        placement, the process of giving up a city where I&#8217;d lived for a decade 
        even as I continued to live in it.<a name="top"></a></font></p>

        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">that will adorn

        without armor, unable to tell the tale<br>

        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">or with spread 
        fingers hovering over the floorboards, or by assigning the unruly<br>
        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">monosyllabic
