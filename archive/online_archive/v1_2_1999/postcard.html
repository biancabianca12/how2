After the New         Modernisms conference was over I went to Bethlehem (PA.) both to visit         H.D.'s grave and meet some scholars from Moravian seminary where I intend         to go back in order to learn more about Moravian rituals and religious         philosophy and work on the connections between H.D.'s poetry and Moravianism.         When I talked to people about the reason for my visit to Bethlehem, I         saw that most of them hadn't even heard HD's name. I think we must work         much harder in order to make people more aware of her and other poets'         work. I believe that poetry is self-making and what people of our age         need is a new self. Jung declares : ' A work of art is produced that may         be called a message to a generation of men.' We are carriers of the message         and must attempt to increase the number of hearers by creating a new medium         (a new language) to reach people who can form a new self by reading poems,         thereby discovering their common heritage and opening the doors of their         own haunted houses. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So the question         of language is a very important issue and I would like to see people discuss         it. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Nesrin Eruysal         <br>        Middle East Technical University </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">____________________</font></p>      <p><b>12/2/99</b></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Does it         matter?"</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">[excerpts         from letter exchange between Fanny Howe &amp; Kathleen Fraser ]<br>        </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I just feel         that generally there is something about poetry now that is bigger than         any particular person--women poets especially. There are so many of us,         and more and more and more, and each one as intelligent and concentrated         as the one before, so that there is this feeling of a huge field with         lots of women standing in it, looking out at the sky, wondering together         when the noon light will follow on her or her or her. There are no judges.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">....The         frightening fact is, we don't know what all this intelligence means. It         won't be known until all of us are gone. What is really being said? What         is the subject of all this work? Does it matter?</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I think         it does matter because it's part of the history of intelligence, but unfortunately         we can't be the ones who know. And I think people get really upset by         being left out, or misunderstood, because of this fundamental unknowingness.         Maybe we will all be understood only en masse, and not as individuals,         as in the past. . . . And maybe life itself will rear its ugly head in         the end, and how each of us lived will actually be important, not just         how we wrote, and there will be some sudden heroic poets who laid down         their life for it, and for life itself, who will explain its meaning--to         those who come after. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">FH<br>        </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">12/12/99</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 've continued         to be haunted by your description of all of us standing in the field,         waiting for some noonlight to find us, some recognition by the non-existent         judge/s. And then--in mental space-- I place this image next to the proposed         division of labor recently expressed by a prominent scholar that "poets         should stick to writing poetry and critics should write the criticism"....</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Somewhere         in this dynamic there is both the absence and presence of "the judge"         figure who seems to represent--at least for many women poets--the internalized         symbolic as well as the actual operating dynamic of "sit &amp; wait,"         with its enemy adjuncts and undermining maxims that "excellence will win         out" and "the talented will find their readership"... (scouted while waiting         tables in the studio lunchroom).</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is not         that one does n't deeply appreciate the brilliant scholarship--both traditional         and exploratory-- currently available, but that beyond those few figures         repeatedly read as exemplars are all the other women standing in the field.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is the         perception of how this subtle reinforcement works--i.e., "few will be         chosen" (by the few others doing the choosing)--that should provide the         spirited impetus for more women poets &amp; scholars to begin writing         about the under-appreciated, non-reviewed works that excite them to further         writing and reading as thinking individuals. For this reason, How2 encourages/         incites active resistance to the depressing and self-limiting conclusion         that there is only ONE useful (official? rational? authoritative? properly         trained?) way to think and write about work being produced--in this case,         by women writing outside the establishment mainstream. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">KF<br>        </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">12/13/99</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The issue         that at present really presses on me is that of the proliferation of perfect         poems coming out of everywhere. It is as if a certain level of education,         mixed with a certain amount of time to think, produces a certain kind         of construction in language--about which one could have no complaints         at all!</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What I am         getting at is the feeling that it is time for life itself to matter again.         That is, the life of the poet. This isn't something that you can dictate         or deliver, but I feel that it will begin to happen on its own, a kind         of storm from under, the way hip hop blasted its way up and through all         the obstacles. Now I am not even sure exactly what I am after, but I know         I am amazed by the wonderful poems women (in particular) are writing,         and feel the intelligence as an act of freedom in itself. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But I also         wonder what happened to the stench of reality that used to cling to certain         works/words. Gone! So it is partially an aesthetic response I am talking         about, but also one about the actual human, lived life of the poet. We         used to know something of that, and care about its content. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">FH</font></p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">____________________</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Responses to How2/n2</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="3">from         Lisa Docherty, 10/30/99:</font></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dear Kathleen         Fraser</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I've just         emerged from three days in How 2 No 2.

I've added         to my home-made book of my favourite poetry pieces from the first two         issues, and made a note to look out for publication of your Essays book,         with "The Uncontainable".

She wants to frustrate communication, dialogue,         comparison.

There is a market place commercial interest that         is controlling language and discourse and research in universities. Also,         an action is not the same action if one has to take the word feminist         out of one's language in order to affirm the action. There are in this         case two, or more, actions: the action with the word, which has been suppressed         and is therefore not in the (public) world, and the apparent action without         the</font> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">word         that is the action in the world, which secretly confirms the sexist desires         to erase feminism even from feminist motivated actions.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Does this         make sense?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Carla</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">___________________________________________</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Fear         of "going public" with private ideas</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">____________</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>from         Elizabeth Costello,10.29.99:</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I'm a student         in Susan Gevirtz's class at USF. Last night we were discussing that fear         that even some very accomplished women have of contributing to HOW2, and,         more generally, that fear of presenting one's private ideas in a public         forum. I think that fear has a lot to do with the habit of defensiveness         that comes from having a set of ideas that are disruptive to the status         quo. Once you get to a place where such ideas are welcomed, it can be         slightly disorienting. The combative stance is no longer necesary in such         a place, so you have to learn a new mode of discourse. You're no longer         banging your head against a wall, but instead have been given a set of         drums. However, now that you have found "your people" what if you are         actually incapable of expressing yourself in this new mode? The fear says         that these friends, these comrades and colleagues will be able to see,         better than any of your detractors, the flaws in your argument.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There is         always a battle going on (I daresay in everyone, on some level) between         the various selves of a self. In one of those battles the self that would         be, given the right conditions fights the self that is, given the actual         state of things. When the conditions begin to get right for the would         be self to emerge the fear arises that, in fact, it wasn't the conditions         that were wrong afterall, but it was something in the core of the self         that was always, and continues to be, wrong.

Moore was         of course more of an insider, more of a player; but the boys-club condescension         was there straight along, and gained force during the hegemony of the         New Criticism, and never in any case was she accorded major status.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Was she         complicit in her minor role? Yes; consider the modesty she so admired         and which became such an integral part of her constructed persona. Was         this not making, precisely, a virtue of necessity? And if Neidecker toned         down or tamed her style in response to what her mentors seemed to admire,         it is worth remembering that the young, acerbic Marianne Moore -- the         Moore of (for example) <i>To a Steamroller, To Statecraft Embalmed</i>,         and <i>Marriage</i> -- disappears from view as the poet matures. In late         interviews, Moore makes disclaimers about both <i>Marriage</i> and <i>In         Distrust of Merits</i>, insisting that these were merely effusions of         emotion, merely protests, not really poems. The disclaimer is perfect         nonsense, but it does indicate a sensititivey to what was critically correct.         the poety police are always with us.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">--Alicia         Ostriker</font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Notes         on Mina Loy, by Carolyn Burke</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>August         16, 1999, from Carolyn Burke</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><i>When         Does Scholarship Become Fodder for Fiction: The Case of Mina Loy</i></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dear HOW2         editors and readers,</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Mina Loy's         life is the stuff of drama. Given her expatriate experience, participation         in the radical art movements of the early twentieth century, and romance         with the boxer/poet Arthur Cravan, it is not surprising that her life         has been recast in a work of fiction. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is disturbing         to note, however, that Antonia Logue's novel <i>Shadow-Box</i> (Bloomsbury,         Grove/Atlantic, 1999) relies heavily on my <i> Becoming Modern, The Life         of Mina Loy </i>(Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1996)--not only for historical         facts but also for overarching themes, treatment and interpretation of         cultural milieux, and in some cases, narrative structures. A comparison         of the two books shows that while Logue sought to transform this material,         her novel piggybacks on my work, often interweaving innovative parts of         the biography and presenting them as "fact."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On Logue's         behalf one could argue that since the publication of <i>Becoming Modern</i>         Mina Loy's life has entered the public domain. Judging by the stares of         nonrecognition that still greet me in bookshops, however, such a claim         is misleading. When I began work on the biography twenty years ago, she         had been so thoroughly forgotten that most people thought I was writing         about the film star. Since its publication critics have recognized <i>Becoming         Modern</i> as the definitive work on Loy. As such it has a different status         from lives of figures like Gertrude Stein, Hemingway, or Pound, about         whom new biographies are written every decade. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Moreover,         although Logue credits <i>Becoming Modern</i> as one of two outstanding         sources," this acknowledgment is misleading.

When I wrote that "feminism is being somewhat squashed         in the academy while it makes steady advances in many other guises but         its own name," I meant to say that in many ways feminism is an unstoppable         force--and many of its agendas--dismantling of certain hierarchies and         certain kinds of oppression--are now being carried out under other banners,         i.e. multiculturalism, postmodernism, and postcolonlialism. So what to         do with the misogyny that continues to make feminism a bad word, discrediting         and dishonoring the work of feminists? While I will sometimes defend the         name and defend feminists quite directly, I often feel myself to be on         the losing end of this approach. So, I suppose when I put out guerrilla         tactics as an answer, I am looking to beat the anti-feminists at their         own game, slipping the word feminism in when it is least expected, and         otherwise pushing forward many feminist agendas. I don't want to get stuck         in "their" misperceptions and hostility to feminism, so rather than announce         it, I suppose I sometimes behave as if actions speak louder than words--which         I believe they do--and can run less danger of reinvoking the old specters.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">JH</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">____________________         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>July 7, 1999</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear Jeanne, </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Responding to the         section in your paper on Laura (Riding) Jackson, I still find it difficult         to put together almost any poem by Riding and her theory about it.

I think that L(R)J didn't want to be considered         a philosophical poet, for she saw philosophy (perhaps somewhat wrongfully)         as ruminative, not active enough, not committed enough, as responsive         to its own systematic ways of thinking, rather than willing to make intuitive         judgments.

Her early death made it possible for that hegemony to     prevail unquestioned by a female critical voice or by poetry which was other     than "hard clean lines" so dear to the hewers and cleavers of national identity     narratives of the day. </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So I'm sending you a     copy of the long poem just published 62 years after it was written in 1937.     It's called THE BOOK OF NADATH, and I am curious to know your reaction to     it. I've argued long and hard. in the intro, for its importance as an alternative     to just about everything else that was written here in the '30s. Am anxious     now to send it out in the world to discover what parallels it may find with     other kinds of prophetic writing....It would give me great pleasure to think     that Robin Hyde might be read on the other side of the world again as the     millennium turns over.</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On Linda Russo's comments:     I was of course very interested in the screen vs. hard copy observations.     I thoroughly appreciate the argument for having a print copy in front of reading     eyes but would also say this: because I have to read on-screen, I print only     a fraction of what I encounter. If I do print, it all has to be copied into     files wherein I can hike the point size (minimum 16 points Arial; 28 if it's     for reading to classes etc; uses forests of paper). So I've become accustomed     to thinking of the Net as a library I can get to anytime and browse in a way     I can no longer browse a conventional library. I like scooting around in a     site, picking up bits here and there. I like all the stuff archived there     in cyberspace, quietly waiting to be got to by any and by all.

However,     in my mind we need not choose one or the other way of reading or browsing,     but can work to make both the screen version and the printed-out hard copy     as easy to access as possible...to have both capabilities, side-by-side.

HOW2 browse/ability problems</font></b></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ....First of all I think     your idea to publish 2 issues per year is sensible. I initially thought the     first issue was too large, but probably this is more of a "virtual" problem     than an "actual" problem(??). I can't stand to read things on the screen,     and need to print things up to really consider them. And for as much convenience     as the web affords, I like to HAVE the thing, have it lying around, read it,     show it to people who come over....If it seems too big I think this has to     do with the "lack" of browseability in the way it's set up, which the hard     copy introduces-i.e. that of being able to see it all in any order at one     time. </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is absent from the     web version, in part because of the layout: each item sits somewhat separately.     There are links of course, but the items seem discontinuous and the links     are uni-directional in a way. This might also address the issue of formality-there     is an "official" entry to sections to which the table of contents is a "master     plan" and with the links further relegating those possibilities. Again we     are faced with the issue that Alice Notley raises (if one wants to gender     the issue) that we live in a "man-made" world, that the "journal" itself is     a "man-made" form. Does it need to be re-imagined? Or is this one of the pitfalls     of living in space, which is time (or vice versa)? </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The link-format presents     a related problem in printing, in that one must open every single item and     press print, and some items lead to further items (e.g. Frances Jaffer's selection     of poems. There are a few items I missed and have to go back and print)-an     ominous task. When one is not surrounded with campus computing resources-i.e.     paper, toner, a laser printer, limitless on-line time-this can be daunting,     economically and technologically. Lacking these resources one might not print     up the issue at all. </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I do think we should     encourage people to think of HOW2 as "an issue" and not just a collection     of parts, as printworthy and not mere cyber ephemera or pastime, and I think     the design could encourage this. One way to do so is to have a scrolling format-all     items link from the table of contents and with different subsections but themselves     compose one long document (in the order presented in the table of contents),     in the way that the "Sections" scrolls, for example, hit print once. This     arrangement also saves paper as it allows for the whole to be double-sided,     eliminating those lone pages incurred in odd page-numbered items.... Is there     some way to make it printable with some sort of "print the whole thing" button/command?     </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In choosing scrolls over     links you lose some of the neat hypertext embeddedness (its feminine quality?)     which increases the sense of depth, but it is here, in the case of Frances     Jaffer's poems, that things get overlooked-or are easy to overlook. When browsing,     one at least has to look before one can overlook. Poetry, as a visual-linguistic     medium, seems particularly dependent on this condition. Yet it's into the     pockets (or is it the seams?) of (homosocial) discourse that women do get     pushed...and lost. Perhaps we are still "leveling the field"-as much as we'd     like to think we're post-feminist!-and we might think of HOW2 as a textual     analogue of the work to be done to increase visibility in the larger (textual)     world. </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Other than this user-convenience     issue, the website is really well done, a really nice design with some happy     little neat cyber-tidbits (bells &amp; whistles so to speak) going on.</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Best and happy June,</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Linda</font></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Rome/ June 3, 1999</b></font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear Linda,</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thank you for taking     the time to write down your thoughts-as reflected in precise technological     terms for this particular journal &amp; the electronic medium, generally-and     for reviewing options available to us as we think into future issues of HOW2.     </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I'll immediately FORWARD     your suggested "browseability" options to our new webmaster, Roberta Sims,     at Bucknell University. She is just beginning to actively engage with the     overall design process, having inherited the design of n1 from Stan Friedman,     the excellent designer provided by the Rutgers HOW(ever) archive project.     As we think towards issue n2, Roberta has already come up with some great     ideas in response to our need for a visually livelier entry page (splash page)     as a gate to the rest of the journal/archives/etc. Roberta has developed visual     design changes that you will soon find incorporated into the home page &amp;     section introductions of the current issue and throughout issue n2. </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your problems and possible     solutions for making the actual "browsing " easier are related to the actual     engineering design and I would guess that if it can be done, Roberta can do     it. </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Regarding the original     design of HOW2 following the "man-made" template, which Alice Notley speaks     of, I'm not too worried about this since we are very spontaneous and fluidly-inclined     around here, and quite open to anything that can help the reader to take in     the work. While our Table of Contents may derive from a "master plan," it     was put there as a useful tool to consult &amp; guide the reader through the     overall picture, as well as to propose individual items a reader might have     particular interest in pursuing-generally a good idea, in the way that certain     kinds of books include useful indexes. The rest of the original design-visually-speaking-was     encouraged by me as a first-time-out resemblance between the new electronic     HOW2, &amp; its original in-print predecessor, HOW(ever)....just to reinforce     that recognition of lineage. </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As of now, our tech support     (including html translation and every aspect of visual and engineering design)     is under the care Roberta Sims at Bucknell. I will take very seriously any     concrete ideas that are put forth and will immediately forward them to RS.     </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I particularly loved     your suggestion that HOW2 might be thought of as a "textual analogue of the     work to be done to increase visibility in the larger (textual) world." This     is a model to hang on to and continuously address. </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I hope that you and your     colleagues will be working on snippets, sentences, responses, collaborations     coming out of your reading/s. Remember that in the "alerts" and "postcard"     section, comments on other cultural events-as related to language and the     innovative spirit-are very welcome (film, theater, visuals, dance, mixed (multi)     media...as well as comments/descriptions from the more pedagogical arts of     teaching and curriculum development and media use-especially where experiments     have opened up a work of writing Please tell your poet/scholar friends and     promising graduate students to send us things. This could be a first-and happy-chance     for some of them. </font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">KF<br>    </font></p>  <hr>  <p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">May 29, 1999/ from     Carla Harryman, re. the question of women claiming voice in public space</font></b></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear Kathleen,</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I have at last read all     or almost all of HOW2. It was deeply satisfying. And I was of course thrilled     by the record of Jaffer's eloquent testimony to H.D. and the sample of her     work. It is a fine memorial. The thread among the articles (other than modernism)     is between the female author's relationship to history, literature, and the     canon and the masculinist interpretations of aforesaid (and I'm thinking here     about the themes of surrealism, classicism, objectivism, and the New York     School) as controlling women's positionalities and products based on certain     kinds of apriori investment. The dialogue between the more extended articles     is rich with common concerns.</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I agree that the "forum"     answers did not respond directly to your question and frankly, I think your     question is key and I mean the one about public articulation. I do not think     that that form of publicness is necessarily equivalent to modes of domination.     Indeed, I think that I sometimes get myself in trouble, because I assume that     such forums are based in a democratic ideal that is not about domination but     about speaking to things that matter, challenges to norms, policies, intellectual     assumptions. My notion of "democracy" is neither about mass culture democracy     in which "candidates" grandstand to get votes (and to control issues) with     the rest of us looking on to cast ballots; nor is it about everybody taking     turns in some kind of formulaic manner. It's about a public space that honors     engaged discussion among the diversity of its participants.</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The collectivity has     a responsibility, I think, to make sure that those who have something to say     are heard just as we, who because of our acculturation encounter difficulties     speaking up, have a responsibility to the collectivity to voice our ideas,     our critiques, our challenges. If I did not feel this obligation, I would     almost never attempt to speak in public. Throughout the history of feminism     and modern progressive movements, this form of discussion has been practiced     and (to further state the obvious) women have often been the leaders and instigators     of pubic discussions and political actions on all sorts of public issues.     I'm curious about this gap between intellectual discussion (which often seems     to be about gate-keeping in the context of the contemporary literary culture     we are engaged with) and this other side-by-side history.</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the meantime, I personally     feel enormous hesitation to speak in these public contexts-more than I ever     have. I have attributed this to 1) the sense that whatever I say will be mistaken     and 2) a great reticence to focus only on one point. Both of these issues     could be unpacked at some length. For the time being, I just want to point     out that I would like to have a better handle on the relationship of feminism     and its powerful histories of effective public debate and political actions     to this kind of abjection of public discourse in the recent conference you     refer to in "editors notes &amp;." Is there something not thought through     about the relationship of feminism to entrenched political and academic norms     of public discussion? I do think there is a relationship between the common     thread of the articles in the first issue mentioned above and my own anxieties     about public discussion.</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I am quite grateful that     you have provided this beautifully organized space for publication and discussion.     I have never had the slightest desire to enter the list serve discussions,     but your on-line journal is a whole other story. I love that you have used     the medium so well, such that there are substantial articles, works and thoughts     in progress, poetry and art, quotes and commentary.</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">More later,</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Carla<br>    </font></p>  <hr>  <p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">5/10/99, Marcella     Durand--from St. Mark's Poetry Project to the Barnard College conference</font></b></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hi Jo Ann,</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What a thrill to go all     the way from downtown St. Mark's to uptown Barnard. Ah, legitimacy! I didn't     feel so much subversive, as practical. I wanted to get into actual happenings,     techniques, venues--solid matter--I wanted to fire up the audience (a mix     of students, poets, &amp; publishers) to publish. And not just publish, but     be published. We addressed the continuing problem of women releasing their     work to be read, edited, spoken. I felt satisfied that together as a panel     we raised urgent and pertinent questions about poetic action: communities,     institutions, reading series, publications. It was great to see male faces     in both panels and audience, actively engaged, concerned. The entire event     had an energizing air of internationalism and urbanity.

It's just becoming     more and more evident that most people have a limited tolerance for screen     reading time and while they can print out any single text, many don't have     the home facilities to do that. So it seems to me that often there are one     or several sections of a talk/essay that pertain more particularly to what     HOW2 is focusing on...the excerpts, thusfar, have been selected in this way.     We can always include a "link" or reference to where the complete text can     be found, if it does exist in another location. Also the author can simply     say "No" to excerpting. We always check out any excerpting proposal with her     first. But as to a single prescribed (correct?) way of doing things, this     is exactly what we are trying to undermine-by inviting all sorts of "readings"     and, in fact, constructing various places in HOW2 where shorter and longer/formal     &amp; less formal speculations, reflections, partial findings can unfold.</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If readers will read     the descriptions at the beginning of each discrete section, they will find     this out.</font></p>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The editors</font></p>  <hr>  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">    <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">      <param name="movie" value="../../Images/navbar.swf">      <param name="quality" value="high">      <embed src="../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>    </object>  </font></p></td>    <td width="12" height="6060" valign="top"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="12" height="54" valign="top"></td>    <td width="76" height="54" valign="top"></td>    <td width="10" height="54" valign="top"></td>    <td width="40" height="54" valign="top"></td>    <td width="4" height="54" valign="top"></td>    <td width="7" height="54" valign="top"></td>    <td width="5" height="54" valign="top"></td>    <td width="72" height="54" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="73" height="54" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="73" height="54" colspan="3" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="72" height="54" colspan="3" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="146" height="54" colspan="2" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="23" height="54" valign="top"></td>    <td width="12" height="54" valign="top"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="12" height="1" valign="top"><img width="12" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="76" height="1" valign="top"><img width="76" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="10" height="1" valign="top"><img width="10" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="40" height="1" valign="top"><img width="40" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="4" height="1" valign="top"><img width="4" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="7" height="1" valign="top"><img width="7" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="5" height="1" valign="top"><img width="5" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="73" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="4" height="1" valign="top"><img width="4" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="42" height="1" valign="top"><img width="42" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="27" height="1" valign="top"><img width="27" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="5" height="1" valign="top"><img width="5" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="13" height="1" valign="top"><img width="13" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="54" height="1" valign="top"><img width="54" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="130" height="1" valign="top"><img width="130" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="16" height="1" valign="top"><img width="16" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="23" height="1" valign="top"><img width="23" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="12" height="1" valign="top"><img width="12" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>  </tr></table></BODY></HTML>
