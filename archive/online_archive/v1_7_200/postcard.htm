The &quot;postcard&quot; has been more intended         as a forum for exchange on work in recent issues... &amp; related questions.         We have, however, run a few announcements recently that have come from         our contributors and are beginning to run some very short comments on         books of poetry of particular interest to our readers. Can you fill me         in a bit on your project, and context?<br>        <br>        thanks, KFraser<br>        <br>        <br>        Dear Kathleen,<br>        <br>        Sometime in the early 1990's, when I was an undergrad at SFSU, I was in         the Poetry Center looking for a particular book when I came across some         back issues of HOW(ever), which by then had ceased publication. I remember         being very intrigued by the 'working notes' that accompanied poems; it         was the first time I'd seen anything like that. Flash forward several         years, after I'd been to grad school (got my MFA from St. Mary's in 1998)--it's         the summer of 1999, I'm using 'downtime' at my office job to surf the         web, and once again, looking for something else, I find that HOW(ever)         has been resurrected as How2. <br>        Since then I've turned to it often. I loved the Forum in the second issue         on class and innovative writing, since I come from a working-class background         and often felt shut out from the 'innovative' scene for many reasons,         and the responses in that forum helped me put words to experiences I'd         had. I suppose <br>        I've never contributed to How2 (unless you count spreading the word that         it existed as a contribution) because I was under the impression-- perhaps         mistaken-- that work appears there mostly by solicitation.<br>        <br>        As for my 'context': I'm a poet, and in the past few years I've been lucky         to have my work published by<br>        magazines I've long admired, including Volt, Colorado Review, and Fourteen         Hills. In 2000 I received the<br>        Phelan Award for my manuscript-in-progress [which is still, two years         later, very much 'in progress'!<br>        <br>        What I hope for Xantippe is that it can be a forum for poetry of many         stripes-- there's no one formula or<br>        'school' that I adhere to, and feel that innovative writing comes in many         different forms and from many<br>        different voices, some of whom might not readily claim the mantle 'innovative'         for what they do. I've already received some work (or promises of work)         from poets including Christine Hume, Elizabeth Robinson, D.A. Powell,         Megan Pruiett, Kimberly Johnson, John Beer, &amp; Cheryl Burket. I'm hoping         that by posting my request at How2, I will receive interesting work that         I didn't directly solicit. My other hope for the journal is to publish         reviews of small press/university press books and chapbooks; I want my         readers to hear from their peers about what's out there, and hopefully         seek out books they might not have heard of otherwise.<br>        <br>        I hope this clarifies why I sent the posting to How2--<br>        <br>        Best,<br>        Kristen</font>      <HR>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>September/         02</strong><br>        <br>        from Dee Morris<br>        <br>        <strong>TIR WEB/</strong> A journal of New Media and experimental writing         and art<br>        &amp;<br>        <strong>NEW MEDIA POETRY</strong>: a conference on Aesthetics, Institutions,         and Audiences<br>        <br>        <strong>TIR WEB</strong> [The Iowa Review Web] is published at the University         of Iowa with support from the Department of English and in collaboration         with The International Writing Program and the Iowa Review.<br>        <br>        Volume 4, Number 5 (September 2002)<br>        <br>        <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Eiareview/">http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/</a><br>        </font>      <HR> <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">current issue         featuring NEW MEDIA WRITING by Stephanie Strickland</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;V: VNIVERSE&quot;<br>        <br>        A preview of Stephanie Strickland's new poem V (Penguin 2002), featuring         V's<br>        Web section, V: VNIVERSE, an interview with Strickland by Jaishree K.         Odin,<br>        and a critical essay by Odin on &quot;Image and Text: The Ballad of Sand<br>        and Harry Soot.&quot;<br>        <br>        All at:<br>        <br>        <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Eiareview/">http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/</a><br>        or<a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Eiareview/%3Etirweb/feature/strickland/index.html"><br>        http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/&gt;tirweb/feature/strickland/index.html</a><br>        </font></p>      <HR> <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>NEW         MEDIA POETRY</strong>: a conference on Aesthetics, Institutions, and Audiences<br>        <br>        October 11-13, 2002<br>        <br>        <strong>Conference website</strong>: http://www.uiowa.edu/~iwp/newmedia/<br>        <br>        The conference will focus on digital and New Media poetry, exploring cross-disciplinary         and cross-cultural accounts of this work in the broader context of contemporary         digital arts and culture.

Rather than many disparate bits (cuts?)         given on the page, there are two cuts of writing interacting with each         other in more than a visual context. Is writing purely visual (read, if         you, like &quot;material&quot;)? There is the matter of intent, of the         author's thoughts, even if at the instance of composition the author is         mainly thinking of something other than her writing. So what then of the         words - or, here, in &quot;Deep Ears,&quot; the cut phrase as line and         line as constantly projecting unit - that exist outside the author's intent         (though it could easily be argued that all ready-made words exist outside         an individual author's intent)? Do the words in &quot;Deep Ears&quot;         arrange their own supra-visual context? They give the impression of meaning         in their proximity, it is true, but does the fact that the words themselves         have in the past been arranged into more traditionally meaning-freighted         sentences, even sentences that have changed lives and altered world history,         lend supra-visual import to &quot;Deep Ears&quot;? I would claim that         the lines in &quot;Deep Ears&quot; are their own past, and the field they         occupy is not one of linguistics per se but of poetry -- something visual         more like a pre-manufactured &quot;natural&quot; phenomenon than a work         of art. It is poetry's special provenance to be neither art nor nature,         nor that which lies between (i.e., nature). Each unit of &quot;Deep Ears&quot;         leading into and forming the next is a type of writing discrete from the         next such unit. Hence, there are always two types of writing in this poem.         It is the act of writing visible AND intellectual. The intent in this         poem arises from the thrust of the structure inherent in &quot;Deep Ears.&quot;</font></p>      <hr> <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>5/18/02</b><br>        <br>        from Sawako Nakayasu<br>        <br>        <b><i>PLAY A JOURNAL OF PLAYS</i></b><br>        <br>        seeks submissions for its inaugural issue.<br>        <br>        <i><b>PLAY</b></i> will publish work that radically rethinks the life         of plays on the page.

Our relationship in New York         where we shared an apartment was harmonious. We were at times oddly alike,         having the same likes and dislikes, although she did prefer second-rate         novels. I believe it was a way of relaxing. Her children are consistent         readers. One could say it was a literary family.<br>        <br>        I shall continue to miss her. She possessed a sudden humor, unlike anyone         else I knew. She lived in a literary, sophisticated household in her youth,         and I benefited from being near her humor and her style. She was a child         of H.D. the poet and that says much. I read a book on the history of music         by her real father, Cecil Gray, and it is brilliant and subtle. One always         wonders how her life might have changed, had her real father once appeared         in her adulthood. She told me she &#147;once saw her father walking on         the beach on Capri, with a famous opera star, pearls floating on his back.&quot;<br>        <font size="-1"><br>        Barbara Guest&#146;s <i>HERSELF DEFINED.

What nice ordinary names.&#148;         She told me your names&#151;Valentine, Nicholas, Elizabeth, and Timothy.         And she said that it was very important that I understand that her mother         had never stood at the kitchen counter making peanut butter sandwiches         for her daughter. That she, Perdita, never had other companions to play         with; that she, Perdita, was forbidden school and schoolmates. She said         to never forget that H.D. loved the idea of motherhood more than she could         bear the messiness of it all. I could sense her quiet defiance, her determination         to create a home for her four children that would be more ordinary, more         filled with friends and peanut butter sandwiches and station wagons and         stories about school. I imagine now that she would have been&#151;or at         least wanted to be&#151;the perfect &#147;soccer mom,&#148; driving you         kids here and there to this lesson and that lesson, this friend and that         friend.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we settled into         the warm sofa with the fading brown cover&#151;I seem to see in my mind&#146;s         eye shades of brown and tan and fading green or blue&#151;with tea in         hand, she brought to life for me a childhood filled with melodrama, with         talented, driven, somewhat crazy <I>artistes</I> flying in and out of         rooms, slamming doors, staring moodily, fiercely private or intrusively         bossy&#151;all at Kenwin, the villa above the lake, a modern Bauhaus where         art was made. She&#151;the child&#151;never quite sure who would be in         her life or out of it at the next moment, didn&#146;t know what the storms         were all about, just that the storms blew her one way, then the other.         The alternative? Stuck at Audley House, stuck in white gloves and rules         rules rules. Shuttled from Kenwin to London, opposite lives. And her two         mothers&#151;the one, distant, adored, with not enough but very precious         moments shared with special intensity and privacy; the other, fierce and         domineering, the Steam Roller. She said &#147;My Two Mothers.&#148; She         said &#147;They were Platonic lesbians.&#148; It took me many years to         understand the wisdom of her seemingly casual remarks.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With her talk, Perdita         brought a world to life for me, perched me on the windowsill of a world         I could scarcely imagine by myself, no matter how much I read in the still         uncatalogued papers stored in the bowels of Beinecke, waiting for the         meticulous and inspired and tender curation of Louis Silverstein.

As time passed, she assumed the public mantle         of H.D.&#146;s daughter with great dignity and generosity, growing into         it, having the wisdom to let a hundred flowers bloom, let anyone have         access, let anyone say what they would say or write what they would write.         Wrongheaded? So what. Stupid? So what. Off on cloud nine? So what. Incomprehensible?         So what. Involved in its own world? So what.

Her writing has the         detail, the rootedness of Bryher; the grace, rhythm, and insight of H.D.&#151;her         two mothers braided into a style uniquely her own.

Both were generous         hosts in their different ways and gracious dinner guests. At home, amid         a pleasant shuffle of tall children grown up and often going or coming,         as amiable as their parents, Perdita was the Lady of the Perpetual Meat         Loaf, which she claimed to have shaped into a delicious centerpiece from         odds and ends found loitering in the fridge or larder, even table scrapings,         and John, encased in his loud All-American chef&#146;s apron, presided         over a metal basin of steaming clam shells and other seashore salvage.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I still treasure         the visual impact of Perdita, the Dutch cap of black hair, the quick,         wise, almost childlike smile, the sudden wave of a dismissive hand when         a disdained name or subject (usually political) came up in conversation,         the general impression she gave of a convivial benevolence&#151;fused         with a deep-rooted shyness, arm frozen at the ready to ward off surprise         attacks, however clearly pleased to have people enjoying her cat-patrolled         house and grounds. It was easy to see how her tall, self-assured husband         must have given her a necessary sense of safety&#151;she told me on more         than one occasion that she liked the &#147;big bear&#148; aspect of my         bulky presence (much bulkier then, than now) when I showed up to take         her back to our house for lunch or dinner or when she joined us going         to one of the inevitable and endless Hampton lawn parties, poetry readings,         gallery openings.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Of course, I had         known of Perdita before we met her, having done research in areas of literary         history that intersected with the career of her mother, the poet H.D.,         who had given birth to her while in the throes of double pneumonia. I         was aware of the hectic household she grew up in, dubbed &#147;the lump&#148;         in her infancy by its melange of egocentric, variously talented artist         types as contemptuous of gender roles as of bourgeois conformity, a household         strange enough to make my own dysfunctional nest appear semi-normal. And         I marveled at her serene survival and major achievements in subsequent         life tasks, mastering three languages, serving at Bletchley during the         war, emigrating alone to America afterwards to acquire a new citizenship,         a literary agent husband, and four bright, highly individual children.         Fascinated from a biographer&#146;s perch, urging her, like many others,         to write an autobiography, I was curious about the flesh and blood specifics         of her rich past, which included a cast of extraordinary characters that         ranged from D. H. Lawrence (once suspected, like Ezra Pound, of being         her father) and Aldous Huxley to the outrageous Sitwell clan.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">She did indeed try         to preserve her past with the pen throughout the 1980&#146;s, taking workshops         and turning out prefaces and brief memoirs for reprints of her mother&#146;s         books. It was in one such, a contribution to Michael King&#146;s 1986         anthology, H.D.: Woman and Poet, that Perdita confirmed the difficulty         she faced as an author, recalling that her two mothers (H.D. and her partner,         Winifred Bryher) &#147;were writers, which indeed I knew all along. .         . . Maybe I&#146;d become a writer too. No. I couldn&#146;t compete.&#148;         What she did write, however, was inevitably deft and perceptive, if reticent         in a shrewd minimalist fashion that painted much more than was on the         page, self-deprecatingly honest and capable of a sly wit but forever tolerant         of the foibles of her family and other strangers.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In her 1983 introduction         to H.D.&#145;s novel, Bid Me To Live, Perdita is quite candid about her         biological father, the composer Cecil Gray. Noting that she had been legally         adopted by the Macphersons in 1927 (Bryher had wed Kenneth Macpherson         after divorcing Robert McAlmon), she recounted the sole meeting she had         with Gray twenty years later, which passed pleasantly without a single         mention of their relationship. &#147;Let sleeping dogs lie,&#148; was         Perdita&#146; s prescription for healing peace, here and elsewhere. &#147;Don&#146;t         disturb the profound animal.&#148;</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Such a prescription,         which comes at a high cost, to be sure, had its origins in an ambivalence-shaken         childhood, cradled in great wealth but wracked by fierce contrary emotional         winds. Perdita&#146;s &#147;Sketch of H.D.: The Egyptian Cat,&#148; done         in 1980 for the reissue of another H.D. novel, Hedylus, gave the first         of several capsule views of her lonely early years: &#147;We lived in         Switzerland . . . isolated from the world. Visitors came by from time         to time; mostly writers, adults only. I never consorted with other children,         other families, other mothers.&#148; In the same memoir, H.D. is limned         as &#147;a tall figure of striking beauty ...and frequently overwrought,         off in the clouds, or sequestered in a room, not to be disturbed on any         account.&#148; Later, happily, according to Perdita&#146;s account, once         free of &#147;the pressures and conflicts of motherhood,&#148; H.D. &#147;became         a much better mother. . . . We were adults together, and friends. &#147;         </font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet the dolorous         refrain haunting the prefaces and introductions Perdita produced for her         mother&#146;s reissued books was a dirge of sorts for a childhood denied,         as in the 1986 preamble to H.D.&#145;s Nights that summons up the imposing         Bauhaus on Lake Geneva where she entered her painful teens: &#147;We were         terribly ingrown, a volatile microcosm in the vastness. I was caught up         in it, and trapped, yet an outsider, a gawky adolescent without a clue         as to what was going on. I missed a lot, but I will never forget the tensions.&#148;         Without a father, or too many of them, Perdita&#146; s core self split         and reforged itself in the crucible of two contending, if not antithetical,         female forces: the adored rejecting poet goddess and her earthbound opposite,         the plain, blunt, kindly Bryher, rebelling against her own distancing         parents, avant-garde in her artistic sympathies but common-sense firm         in her nurturing practicality. Perdita&#146;s &#147;Pandora&#146;s Box,&#148;         written in 1981 to provenance her mother&#146;s HERmione&#151;Hermione         was, of course, mother to the charming Perdita in Shakespeare&#146;s Winter&#146;s         Tale&#151; Perdita articulates the anguish and outrage of every artist&#146;s         offspring ever forced to sit outside a closed door while her or his parent         is obsessively pursuing the Muse: &#147;Hush, Hush, whisper who dares.         &#145;Your mother is working.&#146; In her room, behind a locked door.         . . . I wanted to be in that room. I resented being hauled away.&#148;</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is here that Perdita         dramatizes the pull of the female spirits that would shape her into the         human paradox she became: &#147;&#145;Hippo, hippo,&#146; [Bryher] would         yell, pursuing me with a hippo hide whip. And I was stood in comers, and         deprived of dessert, like any bad Victorian child. Well warranted, I have         no doubt. . . . In their different ways, both mothers gave me a lot of         affection. . . . I just never knew what was going to happen next. &#147;         The Perdita whom Paula and I met and came to cherish seemed very much         an amalgam of her two mothers, a lover of books and literature, a fond         mother and grandmother, a graceful survivor of the natural disasters inflicted         by irrational fate, including the death of John in 1983 and her son Nicholas         in 1991.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The latter blow sought         minor relief in yet another verbal cameo, this one, &#147;His Mother&#146;s         Tribute,&#148; appearing in Out of Season (1993), Paula&#146;s anthology         of pieces by and for people who died before their time, and following         several of Nicholas&#146;s own poems and Timothy&#146;s adroit elegy for         his brother. Again, brevity and the fertile unspoken prevail. &#147;&#145;Love         you,&#146; one of us would say, countered by &#145;I love you too&#146;         by the other,&#148; is how she begins, going on to isolate his specialness:         &#147;not the oldest, not the youngest, not the girl&#148;&#151;and to         salute his dedication when critically ill at winter&#146;s start, keeping         &#147;hard at work with final revisions, proof corrections, captions&#148;         for his final book. The tribute ends as it begins, circling to the last         visit, &#147;&#145;Love you,&#146; I said at the door of his hospital         room. &#145;Love you too,&#146; he replied with that wonderful smile.&#148;</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In retrospect, one         can appreciate the heroic attempt to hang a full portrait on a single         peg, and the unbearable sadness of the tears that always sear deepest         and endure the longest, the unwept ones. Her consolation in her last years,         besides the evident joy in her grandchildren, Timothy&#146;s sons, Wyatt         and John, and Val&#146;s two girls, Kaya and Lia (Perdita died before         Pada&#146;s birth but knew he was on the way), was in accepting her beacon-like         place in her mother&#146;s lengthening public shadow: &#147;Late in life,&#148;         she wrote, &#147;I&#146;ve come to a new career, or rather, it has come         to me: keeper of the flame, a daunting responsibility.&#148; It was also         a career she patently relished. I remember running across her one winter         in Houston, the odd venue for that year&#146;s annual MLA Convention,         and being warmed by the evident delight she took in the session and panel         devoted to her mother&#146;s work.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of Perdita&#146;         s finest literary miniatures is &#147;A Day at the St. Regis with Dame         Edith,&#148; which was published in the American Scholar (1992) and recently         reprinted in The Pushcart Book of Essays (2002). It cleverly and with         gentle humor depicts the extravagant behavior and dress of Edith Sitwell         on one of her rare visits to New York but pauses amid the fun to observe         with typical acuity: &#147;I realized how intensely vulnerable she was,         underneath the flamboyance, beyond her spectacular fac&acirc;de.&#148;         Like Perdita herself, no doubt, a vulnerability I witnessed during my         last glimpse of her on Main Street in East Hampton, when I met her as         she emerged from one of that avenue&#146; s notoriously overpriced boutiques.         Some doubtless flippant remark of mine elicited that trademark &#147;Oh,         yes,&#148; that Cheshire smile and dismissive wave of a hand as she waited         to be helped into a car by the solicitous Catherine, obviously enfeebled         but still refusing to accept the brutally unacceptable.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps the best         manner in which to say goodbye to Perdita is to remember the brilliant         wood violets that spangle the Schaffner fields each year and share the         opening poem of H.D.&#145;s 1921 collection, Hymen, which was dedicated         to Bryher and Perdita:</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">They said: <BR>        she is high and far and blind <BR>        in her high pride, <BR>        but now that my head is bowed in sorrow, I find <BR>        she is most kind. <BR>        We have taken life, they said, <BR>        blithely, not groped in a mist <BR>        for things that are not&#151; <BR>        are, if you will, but bloodless&#151; <BR>        why ask happiness of the dead? <BR>        and my heart bled. <BR>        Ah, could they know <BR>        how violets throw strange fire, <BR>        red and purple and gold, <BR>        how they glow <BR>        gold and purple and red <BR>        where her feet tread.</font></P>      <P><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ed Butscher is a         poet and a biographer of Sylvia Plath and Conrad Aiken.
