<P>Recuperate krylon cocoa 
<BR>Recipe brindled aromatics 
<BR>Predisposed to sensorial schedules daily kaka 
<BR>Diffusion of disgust 
<BR>Creation of a network for each agent who participates 
<BR>in rotting cocoa (pleading of tasting). </P>
<P>The marriage must be celebrated.&#160; I unite 1/2 oleo with the Noble Old!&#160; The Noble 
<BR>World! </P>
<P>Let me lead you to the base of the brain of the cocoa.&#160; Distilled 100% in mother-bath and limbic ram.&#160; Each time a stoppered bottle comes to penetrate the plantagenates of cocoa, from that thing in the memory, to a time when the earth will be perfumed with cocoa. </P>
<P><B>The Cult of Cocoa</B> </P>
<P>The cult of Cocoa signifies a belief in gusto and 
<BR>1) Information of consumerism 
<BR>2) Conservation of our biodiversity </P>
<P>DON&#146;T SLEEP but combat the logic of the marketplace which has produced a uniform taste and almost extinction of cocoa.&#160; DON&#146;T SLEEP but rise up from the forest and press on the art of respect and patrimonial genetics of each variety borne on an ecosystem complete and delicate.&#160; The noble and oily seeds of the Ancient and New Worlds. </P>
<P>DON&#146;T SLEEP but be a protagonist in this romance of the knight of cocoa&#148; </P>
<P>DON&#146;T SLEEP &#150; bear the logo of cocoa &#150; the rose of cocoa &#150; the corsair flag, all integral ambience.&#160; The forested heritage raining commercialized national genes </P>
<P>DON&#146;T SLEEP but be recognized throughout the world for cruel originality </P>
<P>92% of the harvest of the world will be less pregnant (a bottom taste of razzmatazz and astringency, a grade of superior fermentation) </P>
<P>In this great centennial year, cocoa lives in a salvaged state, declining the best from a vital circle. Interdependent, needing the shade of the banana tree and humid earth </P>
<P>Give me mud, parrots, and small meatballs which are the favorites of cocoa.&#160; Gas, abandoned and gushing from the decomposing fruit of the brain.&#160; Safeguards signify the extinction of pocket-space from the hands of men. Durations of tonsillitis materializing in a war in which we can&#146;t loose our heads.&#160; Undesirable dispersions of viscosity </P>
<P>DON&#146;T SLEEP but be natural and rich like a fruit in season&#160; </P>
<P></P>

<P>Why are secondary aromas so important? 
<BR>Because there exists a certain + correlation between aromatic traits on the one hand and persistent sweetness and roundness on the other </P>
<P>Esmereldas, warm tropical scent. 
<BR>The freshness of spring foam, the strabismus of Venus, aftertaste of golden tobacco. </P>
<P>Frankness, the synthesis of the 3 balances of elegance thanks to a soft, fine brush stroke 
<BR>Porcelana &#150; the pearl of elegance, ricotta in its elegance </P>
<P>&#160; </P>
<P>&#160; </P>
<P>(Grazie per pensare) </P>
<P>&#160; </P>
<P>&#160; </P>
<P>Best Wishes to all you enamourds </P>
<P>Love is an aspect of perfume splendour lacquer 
<BR>baking soda ocean ferns air song </P>
<P>Venus cleanses and tones people who take by the hand their kisses&#160; 
<BR>Walk through the door of this here night&#160; 
<BR>But people who lead, they are not next 
<BR>they never will be the people who are next </P>
<P>(The weasel with a branch of rue) </P>
<P><I>Victory loves care</I> 
<BR>(The oyster opening in the sun) 
<BR><I>Deservedly precious, she came forth from the sky and the sea</I> </P>

<P>&#160;</P>

<P>&#160;</P>

<P>&#160; </P>
<P><B>EXCLUSIVE CLAMOR</B> </P>
<P>Like every year, you risk to create a speculative.&#160; One of the major curiosities will be the presence of the subconscious of Luciano Pavorotti (and Caroline of Monaco who milks her son with love) </P>
<P>Another year and the pharmacy becomes indispensible.&#160; Panorama of medicine.&#160; After having mated a giraffe&#146;s head with a woman of the world and three months before the state proclaimed him the sexiest man of the year, this fascinating actor crescendos (contrary to fathers, doting, and steely auto-controlled) </P>
<P>No.&#160; A woman with propane in the dreams of her desires emphatically adds acid to the presence of another woman and of a child.&#160; The public feminine, a night of underdog love 
<BR>Napoleon is happy anywhere </P>
<P>What estate becomes a city of the world? </P>
<P>Impaired, strange language, important for your tomorrows&#160; 
<BR>Important to keep you gassed and also experienced&#160; 
<BR>Unforgettable, to bring a dove who has a tongue and speaks to us&#160; 
<BR>A local, international dove, consecrated ragamuffin of 50 Easters&#160; 
<BR>The spy who studies becomes peaceful and also diverting! </P>
<P>&#160; </P>
<P><B>EUROWARM</B> </P>
<P>I am woman 
<BR>I am not demented 
<BR>extravagant, singular, extracted, curious, counter-current, nor of a volcanic and electric nature </P>
<P>I will continue on this road to master my passions 
<BR>Fishing for allure, style, and fascism of man 
<BR>What body do you want? 
<BR>Marvels have allies </P>
<P></P>

<P>(A proverb recited each night, with every scandal, will ensure 3 days of marvels)&#160; </P>
<P></P>

<P>In this region, in this world of ours, rich in grain and rubbed evidently with emotion, is truly the marvel of our fugue. With its negative and positive polarities like a manifesto of all animal states complete and befogged, resuscitated from memorabilia.&#160; That is to say, from the most beautiful person that can provoke admiration and joy, in a word, blitz&#160; </P>
<P>Marvels are not a simple surprise. Nor a co-payment for closure in time.&#160; An alabaster core with something that we cannot visit but evaporates into quasi-existence.&#160; Many volts to treat a funny piston</P>
