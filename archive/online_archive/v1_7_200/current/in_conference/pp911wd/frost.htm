<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This special section of &#147;In-Conference&#148; emerges from a panel at the Modernist Studies Association meeting, held in Houston just one month after September 11.&#160; In the wake of the attacks, it wasn&#146;t clear that anybody would be in Houston for the MSA&#151;we didn&#146;t even know if the conference would be held.&#160; Nor was it apparent that our own commitments to the panel (&#147;Modernist Influence on Contemporary Poetry&#148;) could be maintained even if the conference did go on as scheduled.&#160; As coordinators, Michael Bibby, Cynthia Hogue, and I were extremely grateful to Kathleen Fraser, Carla Harryman, and Lorenzo Thomas for gathering to discuss questions of unmistakable urgency in the light of a changing political and cultural landscape.&#160; What emerged was a set of innovative and, in my view, extremely important reflections on poetry post-9-11.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The original purpose of the panel was to explore diverse experiments fostered by modernist poetic radicalism&#151;those somewhat outside of commonly recognized &#147;avant-gardes,&#148; such as Language writing/theorizing.&#160; We were interested in &#147;other&#148; innovations, often taking place within recognizable lyric and narrative forms.&#160; Our three poets were to read their work; then the panel would open to a roundtable discussion about how modernism has influenced (perhaps frustrated, complicated) their writing.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Following 9-11, we began to discuss the need for a broader perspective.&#160; There was (and is) a new self-consciousness about doing what we do.&#160; We asked ourselves: Are priorities the same, for ourselves as poets, critics, teachers?&#160; What is the &#147;relevance&#148; of poetry in a time of war, of terrorism, of heated nationalism?&#160; What are the issues that newly confront us as writers, teachers, readers of contemporary and modern poetry?</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The papers that follow all engage variously with these questions.&#160; Michael Bibby recounts our e-mail discussions preceding the conference to consider new meanings of &#147;innovation&#148; that might move beyond the avant-gardist rhetoric of rupture toward a poetry of &#147;suture.&#148;&#160; Kathleen Fraser documents acts of witnessing, culled from journal entries in the days immediately following 9-11.&#160; To contextualize the current political climate, Lorenzo Thomas returns to the literary scene during and after World War I, with a detailed chronology of censorship, racial politics, and artistic repression.&#160; Finally, Frances Presley provides a view from London, considering architecture, the spectacle of grief, and the &#147;building&#148; of a new avant-garde poetics.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the weeks immediately following 9-11, the limits of language came up again and again, whether in informal e-mail exchanges or in mass media representations.&#160; In the &#147;Postcards&#148; section of How2, many wrote in to recount the painful sense of being speechless &#151; as writers, as critics &#151; in a condition of trauma.&#160; In one of the more mainstream articulations of this sense of being robbed of words, Eric McHenry noted Auden&#146;s critique and ultimate rejection of &#147;September 1, 1939&#148; (which emerged as the ur-poem of 9-11).&#160; McHenry argues that by expressing a sense of his own failure in the poem, &#147;Auden kept in play the possibility&#151;by no means a certainty&#151;that there are sorrows even the most well-chosen words can&#146;t reach.&#148;<A HREF="#_ftn1" NAME="_ftnref1" TITLE=""><SUP> [1] </SUP></A>&#160; But is it perhaps that the <I>expected</I> forms of words can&#146;t reach us?&#160; In other words, that the &#147;new word,&#148; the &#147;news that stays news,&#148; is yet to be invented for this moment?&#160; Perhaps, then, an innovative poetics in the modernist or avant-garde tradition is precisely what is needed?&#160; Or, is the failure of language a response to trauma that any historical or personal disaster evokes?&#160; What sorts of poetry can be responsive to such inadequacies?&#160;</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And, further, how can poetry respond in a cultural atmosphere that has wrought measures to revoke civil liberties?&#160; Things over the last six months have hardly changed since the days following 9-11, when TV journalists were asked to sign statements of allegiance, and others were chastised or dismissed for &#147;inappropriate&#148; critiques of U.S. actions.&#160; It is a time when an academic forum (in October) was denounced by the chancellor of his own university (CUNY) because faculty present &#147;blamed United States foreign policy and capitalist cultural messages&#148; as an underlying cause of the attacks.<A HREF="#_ftn2" NAME="_ftnref2" TITLE=""><SUP> [2] </SUP></A>&#160; There are new surveillance and detention policies, such as the sweeping USA Patriot Act.&#160; In the words of Nat Hentoff, &#147;never in the history of the First Amendment has any suppression of speech been so sweeping and difficult to contest as this one,&#148; which allows the FBI to &#147;demand from bookstores and libraries the names of books bought or borrowed by anyone suspected of involvement in &#145;international terrorism&#146; or &#145;clandestine activities.&#146;&#148;<A HREF="#_ftn3" NAME="_ftnref3" TITLE=""><SUP> [3] </SUP></A>&#160; What becomes of writing and publishing in such a climate?&#160; As one example, consider that Barnes and Noble refused to carry Jonathan Tel&#146;s <I>Arafat&#146;s Elephant</I>, a collection of short stories, unless the title was changed.&#160; (Since Tel refused, of the big chains, only Borders is carrying the book.)&#160;</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">At the same time, in the midst of all this&#151;from September 12 on&#151;has come a widespread circulation of poems by e-mail, appearances in newspapers and in memorials (both &#147;official&#148; and impromptu), with favorites including its own modernist canon of Moore, Yeats, Heaney, Auden.&#160; Whose &#147;modernism&#148; is this?&#160; Whose poetics provides such epigrammatic comforts?</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There has been a clarion call for a new &#147;accessibility&#148; in our poetry.&#160; Among others, this item from the <I>CLMP Newswire</I> concerning New York City editors&#146; responses to &#147;9-11&#148;: Martha Rhodes of Four Way Books describes &#147;looking more for the essential in language and accessibility.&#160; For the leaner and meaner.&#148;<A HREF="#_ftn4" NAME="_ftnref4" TITLE=""><SUP> [4] </SUP></A></P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My own response to shock and speechlessness in New York City was the opposite&#151;to need, desperately, for language to be pushed outward or inward&#151;to change and be changed, to be charged, remade.&#160; What might <I>that</I> new poetry look like?&#160; What sources might it look back to?&#160; And who will be its readers?</P>
