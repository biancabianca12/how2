<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For many who haven&#146;t thought of W. H. Auden since their sophomore literature survey, the events of September 11, 2001 snapped the poem &#147;September 1, 1939&#148; back into focus.&#160; As German aircraft attacked Poland, Auden sat, he tells us,</P>
<UL>
<UL>
. . . in one of the dives<BR>
On Fifty-second Street<BR>
Uncertain and afraid<BR>
As the clever hopes expire<BR>
Of a low dishonest decade:<BR>
Waves of anger and fear<BR>
Circulate over the bright<BR>
And darkened lands of the earth,<BR>
Obsessing our private lives;<BR>
The unmentionable odour of death<BR>
Offends the September night.&#160; (57)

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When the twin towers collapsed again and yet again on television screens across the globe, New York took its place in the westward push of T. S. Eliot&#146;s <I>Waste Land</I> catalogue: &#147;Falling towers,&#148; Eliot wrote, &#147;Jerusalem Athens Alexandria / Vienna London / Unreal.&#148;&#160; Among the multitude of poems sent across listservs, printed in newspapers, and recited at memorials, &#147;September 1, 1939,&#148; &#147;The Waste Land,&#148; and H.D.&#146;s <I>Trilogy </I>slid into position as prophecy, prayer, and consolation.&#160; The rhythms, words, and ritual space of these poems provide focus and a semblance of solace for those who invoke them.&#160; To aid and abet acceptance of loss, provide words to speak into silence, and reconstitute a sense of shared history and values is key cultural work.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It is the contention of this paper, however, that poetry has another role to fill in a time of atrocity.&#160; Against the short-term intimacies of consolation, I want to invoke a long-term, large-scale, propositional poetics: a poetics of difficulty which at its best participates in the creation of a politics of difficulty.&#160; As I hope to show through a consideration of Ezra Pound and Leslie Scalapino, although such a poetics is not always&#151;or only&#151;progressive, its methods are crucial in times of atrocity.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In so far as Scalapino is an innovative rather than a lyrical or meditative poet, she occupies a place in the lineage of Pound, but these two poets make a very odd couple: Pound&#146;s rants, his flights of egoism, and his flirtation with Fascism clash with Scalapino&#146;s attenuations, the koan-like elusiveness of her writing, and her corrosive contempt for bullies and tyrants.&#160; There are, however, similarities that align the propositional poetics of these two writers as a thinking toward action or, perhaps better, a thinking <I>as</I> action.&#160;</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Both Pound and Scalapino are poets of impassioned regard for and address to the public world.&#160; They write within a global network of histories, governments, economies, and texts.&#160; They mess with newspapers, talk like comic books, and, if they could, would publish their work, as Scalapino puts it, &#147;on billboards or outdoors as murals&#148; (<I>Front Matter</I> 1).&#160; While they write in public and to the public, however, they write against conventional public thought.&#160; Their default mode is oppositional, assuming the worst of a greedy, hate-filled, and delusional populace prepared to follow craven leaders into disastrous wars.&#160; Their enormous impatience with institutionalized fraud and stupidity feeds a creativity that takes its shape as an alternate form of intelligence.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The first stanza of Auden&#146;s poem, although clipped, goes with, rather than against, the grain of public thought.&#160; Comfortingly mimetic and hypotactic, its elements bind real-world referents into recognizable patterns of reasoning.&#160; When Auden tells us he sits &#147;in one of the dives / on Fifty-second Street,&#148; we place him in a midtown Manhattan bar; when he says he sits there <I>as</I> &#147;clever hopes expire,&#148; we know these hopes come to an end both <I>at the moment that</I> and <I>because</I> &#147;[w]aves of anger and fear&#148; escalate into war.&#160; In Auden&#146;s stanza, the all but invisible <I>as </I>anchors the reader firmly in a cause-and-effect world of dependent and subordinate syntactical relationships.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As poets, Pound and Scalapino think&#151;and, when they are successful, induce their readers to think&#151;paratactically.&#160; Propositions in their poems swing free, that is, both conceptually and syntactically.&#160; Pound begins Canto 3, in the same manner as Auden begins &#147;September 1, 1939&#148;&#151;&#147;I sat on the Dogana&#146;s steps,&#148; he writes, &#147;<I>For</I> the gondolas cost too much, that year&#148;&#151;but two lines is as far as he can go in a hypotactic vein.&#160; The rest of the canto, like the larger matrix into which it fits, is articulated by the <I>and</I>&#146;s and <I>or</I>&#146;s of parataxis: the lit cross-beams in the palace <I>and</I> the peacocks in Kor&#233;&#146;s house <I>and</I> bright gods in the azure air <I>or</I> gray steps under the cedars; El Cid on the run <I>and</I> Ignez da Castro murdered <I>and</I> plaster flaking from a wall once painted by Mantegna.&#160; This is the method Scalapino identifies in Philip Whalen&#146;s writing as &#147;all layers at the same time&#148; (&#147;Radical Nature&#148; 4).&#160; I will call it, for the moment, the <I>and-effect</I>.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The most efficient way to read Canto 3 is to articulate its components by moving deliberately&#151;with deliberation&#151;from things to concepts.&#160; This is the opposite of conventional thought, which tends, like the canto&#146;s opening lines, to hinge on pre-given cause-and-effect relationships: I sat on the steps, Pound says, <I>because</I> I didn&#146;t have money to take a gondola.&#160; Not interesting.&#160; The rest of the canto, however, applies a lesson Pound learned from Fenollosa&#146;s <I>Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry.</I>&#160; Confronted with the ideograms for &#147;flamingo&#148; <I>and</I> &#147;cherry&#148; <I>and</I> &#147;iron-rust&#148; <I>and</I> &#147;sunset,&#148; Fenollosa tells us, an active reader, at first baffled, will bust through sooner or later into the idea of <I>red</I>.&#160; Confronted with Canto 3&#146;s scenes of exile <I>and</I> banishment <I>and</I> neglect <I>and</I> public indifference to art, a reader will come to the idea of <I>cultural corruption</I>.&#160; Epistemology is the action of the poem.&#160;</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The purpose of the <I>and-effect</I>, then, is to build conceptual categories from the ground up, thus dissolving what Fenollosa called &#147;the discredited, or rather the useless, logic of the Middle Ages&#148; (CWC 12) and allowing a reader to&#151;in Harryette Mullen&#146;s phrase&#151;&#147;think toward action&#148; (Bedient 661).&#160; One should open the gates of Burgos to El Cid; one should maintain Mantegna&#146;s frescos; one should make sure poets have the means to navigate the canals of the city of lights.&#160; The result of thinking upward through the <I>and-effect</I> is the dissolution of public clich&#233;s&#151;that art is a luxury, for example, or that men of forceful will are dangerous to the well-being of the state.&#160; This kind of category-busting, for Fenollosa and Pound, promotes change from within by bringing forces previously held apart into interaction and multiplying their cultural functions (<I>Chinese Written Character</I> 27).</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a number of commentators have pointed out, however, the <I>and-effect</I> of <I>The Cantos</I> is a squeeze play, a trap.&#160; A reader is free to make recategorizations, yes, but only those determined in advance, those any idiot could see, Pound says, if she looks, really looks.&#160; Like his hero Louis Agassiz, who reasoned from &#147;fact&#148; upward to the conclusion that &#147;[s]exual intercourse between whites and blacks . . . was the moral and biological equivalent of incest&#148; (Menand 114), Pound&#146;s recategorizations include ideas Charles Bernstein has characterized as &#147;totalitarianism masking as authority, racism posing as knowledge, and elitism claiming the prerogatives of culture&#148; (<I>A Poetics</I> 121).&#160; For Pound, these conclusions are as natural, objective, and scientific as &#147;redness,&#148; as monovalent and closed as &#147;rightness.&#148;&#160; If we credit Pound&#146;s fulminations against readers who do not use his method to reach his madness, the paratactic thought-path of <I>The Cantos</I> is no less constrained than the hypotactic meditations of &#147;September 1, 1939.&#148;&#160;</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It is tempting to argue that the apparent freedom of Pound&#146;s method is invalidated by the poverty of his ideals, but in the end the method of <I>The Cantos</I> is more powerful and enduring than its application.&#160; As Franco Moretti has emphasized in a similar context, literary evolution, like Marxism, necessitates internal discontinuities, uneven developments.&#160; To the extent that Pound&#146;s method cuts against conventional mentation by requiring a reader to think otherwise, the <I>and-effect</I> is an advance.&#160; &#147;Progress coexists with backwardness, indeed depends on it,&#148; Moretti writes.&#160; &#147;One level of the work can be bold, <I>because</I> the other is crude and superfluous.&#160; It is a constructional split that runs through almost the entire twentieth century&#148; (119).</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pound&#146;s source-text, <I>The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry,</I> is, like <I>The Cantos</I>, an epistemological treatise.&#160; By investigating alternative ways of knowing, Fenollosa&#146;s aim was to teach Westerners to outsmart the conventions of their own logic.&#160; In Fenollosa&#146;s elaborate explanatory metaphor, Western thought consists of word-bricks&#151;&#147;little hard units or concepts&#148;&#151;piled in rows according to function then stuck together into &#147;a sort of wall called a sentence by the use either of white mortar for the positive copula &#145;is,&#146; or of black mortar for the negative copula &#145;is not.&#146;&#160; In this way,&#148; Fenellosa concludes, &#147;we produce such admirable propositions as &#145;A ring-tailed baboon is not a constitutional assembly&#148; (26).&#160; Putting aside for a moment the lovely irony that for Pound and Scalapino assemblies of any sort consist exactly of ring-tailed baboons, I want to segue from Pound&#146;s <I>and-effect</I> to Scalapino&#146;s <I>as-effect</I> through one of Fenollosa&#146;s examples of an ideogrammic way of knowing.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To illustrate his claim that &#147;[i]n reading Chinese we do not seem to be juggling mental counters, but to be watching <I>things</I> work out their own fate&#148; (9), Fenollosa gives the example of the ideogram for <I>ripple, </I>which is a superimposition of the characters for <I>boat</I> and <I>water</I>:&#160; Noun, verb, adjective, adverb, and preposition, &#147;boat-water&#148; is at once a thing, an event, and a relation: a confluence, an ongoingness, a transference of power, a destabilization which undulates outward in all directions.&#160; This ideogram is not an <I>and-effect</I>&#151;boat <I>and</I> water&#151;because the concept <I>ripple</I> does not hold <I>boat</I> and <I>water</I> apart but rather fuses&#151;or confuses&#151;them.&#160; Boat, water, and ripple come into existence together: each component generates and sustains the idea of the others.&#160; Boat-water is a gradual diffusion&#151;a ripple&#151;which outraces identity or sameness.&#160; In this ideogram, &#147;[t]he difference,&#148; as Gertrude Stein famously put it, &#147;is spreading&#148; (9).&#160; </P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Leslie Scalapino&#146;s play &#147;As:&#160; All Occurrence in Structure Unseen&#151;(Deer Night)&#148; is a rewriting of <I>The Tempest</I> without Shakespeare&#146;s plot, characters, language, or setting.&#160; Composed during a trip to Thailand and Bhutan, it is an integral part of a collection of prose and poetry to which Scalapino has given the title <I>The Public World / Syntactically Impermanence</I>.&#160; Like <I>The Cantos</I>, this book is history and dream, narrative, mythology, and literary criticism, polemic and investigation, but I will consider it here primarily as epistemology and syntactics.&#160; &#147;Poetry in this time and nation,&#148; Scalapino says in &#147;The Cannon,&#148; one of the book&#146;s opening essays, &#147;is doing the work of philosophy&#151;it is writing that is conjecture&#148; (19).&#160; Unlike Auden&#146;s hypotaxis and Pound&#146;s parataxis, Scalapino&#146;s syntaxis&#151;if I can call it that&#151;is predicated on enduring uncertainties.&#160; Conjecture&#151;the throwing together that is &#147;syntactically impermanence&#148;&#151;is, by definition, the attempt to reach a conclusion or judgment on the basis of uncertain evidence.&#160; As Lyn Hejinian argues in a parallel statement about her own poem &#147;Happily,&#148; &#147;it is <I>as</I> philosophy--<I>as</I> the making and seeing of connections . . . &#151;that poetry participates in knowing what we can and can&#146;t know about the world and how to live in it&#148; (384; my italics).</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When I say I want to consider Scalapino&#146;s book &#147;as philosophy,&#148; I mean <I>in the guise of</I> philosophy, but I also mean, more precisely, as &#147;<I>as</I>-philosophy.&#148;&#160; The most ambitious segment of <I>The Public World / Syntactically Impermanence</I> is the play-cycle <I>As</I>, which develops through an impermanence syntax&#151;a hypothetical rolling syntax&#151;which Hejinian terms the &#147;as-effect.&#148;&#160; Hejinian explains this effect through an extended analogy with the instrumental case in Russian grammar, which allows one to say not just &#147;she sings like a nightingale&#148; but &#147;she sings <B>as</B> a nightingale&#151;in singing, she becomes a nightingale,&#148; or, in another example, not just &#147;one walks along the shore,&#148; but &#147;in walking along the shore one is that shore.&#148;&#160; &#147;What I am calling the as effect,&#148; Hejinian concludes, &#147;is not a trope but an &#145;occurrence structure&#146;&#148; (5).&#160; It is not additive&#151;I <I>and</I> the nightingale or I <I>and</I> the shore&#151;but mutually transformative: I <I>as</I> the shore, the shore <I>as</I> I.&#160; The as-effect is, in short, an event-in-time between two states: an energy transfer, a thought-ripple.&#160; </P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The subtitle of the play&#151;&#147;All Occurrence in Structure, Unseen (Deer Night)&#148;&#151;names what remains when one abandons the plot, characters, setting, and language of Shakespeare&#146;s <I>Tempest</I> without abandoning an intent to comment on it / demonstrate against it.&#160; As a relationship hinged on <I>as</I>, the play (of) <I>As</I> is a manner of knowing: <I>as if</I>, the play enumerates, <I>at the same time as,</I> <I>as allowing difference</I> (97), <I>as it happens</I> (116), <I>as such</I> (117).&#160; All of these states of experience depend on free movement among events and ideas; all acknowledge uncertainty and contingency; all erode the borders between things and beings.&#160; <I>As</I>&#151;in short&#151;disables the hierarchy, rigidity, and covetousness which, for Scalapino as for many postcolonial scholars, makes Shakespeare&#146;s<I> Tempest</I> a marker text of imperialism and colonialism.&#160;</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Like Pound&#146;s <I>and-effect</I>, Scalapino&#146;s <I>as-effect</I> requires nimble cognition.&#160; &#147;I was interested,&#148; Scalapino writes, &#147;in a syntax whose very mode of observation was to reveal its structure; that is, its subject and its mode are subjectivity being observation&#148; (&#147;Cannon&#148; 26).&#160; The reader of <I>As</I> must not only think but also&#151;and at the same time&#151;think about how she is thinking.&#160; This doubleness has the split of the <I>and-effect</I>&#151;one must consider, at the same moment, multinational corporations, migrants crossing a desert, workers burning tar at dawn, and a girl of fourteen sold into slavery in a brothel&#151;and the twist or gyration of the <I>as-effect</I>.&#160; The exterior subject of the girl in the brothel, for example, spins inward as an interior effect in the memory of a fourteen-year old girl returning from Asia to the U.S.&#160; &#147;The syntax itself,&#148; Scalapino explains, &#147;reorients one&#146;s apprehension (by continual dis-location) and enables that which is exterior to be included in a process of its examination, necessarily self-examination&#148; (&#147;Cannon&#148; 26).&#160; In <I>As</I>, no one thing is central, solo, or still.&#160; Moving against fascism and fundamentalism, <I>As</I> generates a system of multiple truths, lightly held, syntactically impermanence.&#160; Its concepts are at once deconstructive and pragmatic.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Pound and Scalapino ask a lot&#151;some might say too much&#151;of their readers.&#160; As we have seen so starkly in this last month, however, an atrocity like the destruction of the twin towers both emerges from and eventuates in a thinking that asks too little of its cognizers.&#160; In the politics of simplicity, fundamentalism begets oppositional fundamentalism; crusades, crusades.&#160; The discourse is no more complicated than the swapping of pronouns in the interchange &#147;I&#146;m good, you&#146;re evil&#148; / &#147;No, no, <I>I&#146;m</I> good, <I>you&#146;re</I> evil.&#148;&#160; The gap created by <I>and</I> and the twist created by <I>as</I> trouble the categorizations of the public world.&#160; In a time of uneven developments, mutual complicity, and contingent suffering, a poetics of difficulty opens the thinking differently which also constitutes a politics of difficulty.&#160; &#147;In the political sense,&#148; as Harryette Mullen said in phrasing that generated the topic in this panel, &#147;we think of theory <I>as</I> not existing for its own sake but <I>as</I> a way of thinking toward action <I>and</I> how we actually exist in the world after we&#146;ve thought about things.&#160; Thinking should change that&#148; (Bedient 661).&#160;</P>
