<P><I>&#145;... if you think of art as discipline, the people that are interesting are the people that are exploring the structure of the discipline.&#160; In that sense they&#146;re breaking the discipline down, too, as they&#146;re expanding it.&#146;</I>&#160; &#151; Bruce Nauman</P>
<P>I imagine Jenny and Jen at court with Susan Howe and &#145;Pope&#146; Joan Retallack.&#160; Their court would of course be a kind of library...The image &#151; of four American women in a room &#151; is for me an exciting one of poetry generation, Emily Dickinson to the power of x.&#160; But should the library be a grand room of upholstery and green lamps, or a two-walled shack like that on the cover of <I>under what is not under</I>?&#160; For the pioneer spirit is an easy connection to make...</P>

<P><U>(It&#146;s Time)</U></P>

<P>&#145;<I>Mary & Shelley&#146;s Fair Copy Book</I>&#146; is a page turner.&#160; It opens with the vulnerability of a (Frankenstein&#146;s) monster: &#145;tearlessnest ... after I ... v the verrey o on blade ... after openly I/ resemble mysel who believed in my plote...&#146;: or of Molloy.&#160; And though my eye travelled anxiously on and off the lines and forward, I was aware that in each gap perhaps a soul dwelt foot in a trap, that what&#146;s unsaid is perhaps even more heartbreak.&#160; It exemplifies both Hejinian&#146;s argued for &#145;poetry of consciousness,&#146; and Oppen&#146;s &#145;being numerous&#146;.&#160; <I>Mary & Shelley&#146;s Far Copy Book</I> collapses time...</P>
<P>&#145; &#147;Shelley was too fond of/ of the theoretical and the ideal&#146;</P>
<P>They are both green books.&#160; (Out of the frog pond.)&#160; Books for princes/ses: don&#146;t go under.</P>
<P>The cover of <I>Mary & Shelley&#146;s Fair Copy Book</I> is a cooling green, like that of wheatgrass, Cottees&#146; lime cordial, or Pine-o-cleen.&#160; All these drinks taste great to some people and vile to others.&#160; And if you swallow the wrong one inadvertently, Dr Gough has your medicine.&#160; This is <I>not </I>like voting for the wrong person.</P>
<P><I>under what is not under </I>&#160;is pistachio, whoever sewed the cover image on used pistachio cotton.&#160; Baling twine is this colour / colours, like words, or fences, can be followed in different directions.</P>
<P>If <I>Mary & Shelley&#146;s Fair Copy Book</I> is an episode of Twin Peaks, <I>under what is not under</I> is a commercial, one of the very rare, that don&#146;t make up for the others, but at least give you a bit of your soul back.&#160; (Ok, the commercial sensibility is very far from both these books, but I&#146;d like to see a Potes and Poets shop at Melbourne&#146;s Tullamarine airport.)&#160; No &#151; <I>under what is not under</I> is a news break interrupting a performance of <I>A Winter&#146;s Tale</I> in the woods.&#160; Perhaps some of the words were blown away, but what remained...</P>

<P><U>Maintain Your Page</U></P>

<P>As Gertrude Stein made a rose red again, Jenny Gough reinvigorates a page, and Shelley; the radical approach can make anything its starting point: roots are everywhere.&#160; (Romanticism never dies.)&#160; Gough mocks the very notion of marginality.&#160; Any imagined margin in <I>Mary & Shelley&#146;s Fair Copy Book </I>is disregarded, written over, as are lines.&#160; And lines over words... (which come first?).&#160; It&#146;s a book of shock: of being immersed in ice water &#151; awake now?&#160; A book that can be read; words aren&#146;t images.&#160; A working mind needs more than sugar.</P>
<P>&#145;Mary Shelley wrote &#147;on the page.&#148;&#146;</P>
<P>The words of <I>under what is not under </I>can be read in a couple of minutes.&#160; Is this the same as reading the book?&#160; Sure, you can read the space, you can dwell on phrases such as &#145;ahush teary hum,&#146; &#145;a tent took tiro,&#146; &#145;too much, too many, too little to be;&#146; but even though <I>under what is not under</I> is the most linear of books &#151; its text is a broken horizontal line across its unnumbered pages &#151; it invites an unordered reading: &#145;hold time.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; hold time under,&#146; &#145;green.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; hungry in the hold,&#146; &#145;beneath the floorboards.&#146;.&#160; It is thin like wire is thin, &#145;prays not for wind,&#146; &#145;a sailor,&#146; &#145;is&#146;.</P>
<P><U>&#145;a pitch to the tune of the horizon&#146; (<I>under what is not under</I>)./ &#145;Marplotting Mary&#146;s projected life / &#147;the great thing is I am so unequal&#148; &#146; <I>Mary & Shelley&#146;s Fair Copy Book</I></U></P>
<P>Both the production and texts of these two books evoke beginnings.&#160; Poetry is still just starting.&#160; Language is still being born in the Waldens of the human mind.</P>
