      <p style='line-height:200%'>This special section of &#147;In-Conference&#148; 
        emerges from a panel at the Modernist Studies Association meeting, held 
        in Houston just one month after September 11.&#160; In the wake of the 
        attacks, it wasn&#146;t clear that anybody would be in Houston for the 
        MSA&#151;we didn&#146;t even know if the conference would be held.&#160; 
        Nor was it apparent that our own commitments to the panel (&#147;Modernist 
        Influence on Contemporary Poetry&#148;) could be maintained even if the 
        conference did go on as scheduled.&#160; As coordinators, Michael Bibby, 
        Cynthia Hogue, and I were extremely grateful to Kathleen Fraser, Carla 
        Harryman, and Lorenzo Thomas for gathering to discuss questions of unmistakable 
        urgency in the light of a changing political and cultural landscape.&#160; 
        What emerged was a set of innovative and, in my view, extremely important 
        reflections on poetry post-9-11.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>The original purpose of the panel was to explore 
        diverse experiments fostered by modernist poetic radicalism&#151;those 
        somewhat outside of commonly recognized &#147;avant-gardes,&#148; such 
        as Language writing/theorizing.&#160; We were interested in &#147;other&#148; 
        innovations, often taking place within recognizable lyric and narrative 
        forms.&#160; Our three poets were to read their work; then the panel would 
        open to a roundtable discussion about how modernism has influenced (perhaps 
        frustrated, complicated) their writing.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Following 9-11, we began to discuss the need 
        for a broader perspective.&#160; There was (and is) a new self-consciousness 
        about doing what we do.&#160; We asked ourselves: Are priorities the same, 
        for ourselves as poets, critics, teachers?&#160; What is the &#147;relevance&#148; 
        of poetry in a time of war, of terrorism, of heated nationalism?&#160; 
        What are the issues that newly confront us as writers, teachers, readers 
        of contemporary and modern poetry?</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>The papers that follow all engage variously 
        with these questions.&#160; Michael Bibby recounts our e-mail discussions 
        preceding the conference to consider new meanings of &#147;innovation&#148; 
        that might move beyond the avant-gardist rhetoric of rupture toward a 
        poetry of &#147;suture.&#148;&#160; Kathleen Fraser documents acts of 
        witnessing, culled from journal entries in the days immediately following 
        9-11.&#160; To contextualize the current political climate, Lorenzo Thomas 
        returns to the literary scene during and after World War I, with a detailed 
        chronology of censorship, racial politics, and artistic repression.&#160; 
        Finally, Frances Presley provides a view from London, considering architecture, 
        the spectacle of grief, and the &#147;building&#148; of a new avant-garde 
        poetics.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>In the weeks immediately following 9-11, the 
        limits of language came up again and again, whether in informal e-mail 
        exchanges or in mass media representations.&#160; In the &#147;Postcards&#148; 
        section of How2, many wrote in to recount the painful sense of being speechless 
        &#151; as writers, as critics &#151; in a condition of trauma.&#160; In 
        one of the more mainstream articulations of this sense of being robbed 
        of words, Eric McHenry noted Auden&#146;s critique and ultimate rejection 
        of &#147;September 1, 1939&#148; (which emerged as the ur-poem of 9-11).&#160; 
        McHenry argues that by expressing a sense of his own failure in the poem, 
        &#147;Auden kept in play the possibility&#151;by no means a certainty&#151;that 
        there are sorrows even the most well-chosen words can&#146;t reach.&#148;<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup> [1] </sup></a>&#160; But is it perhaps that the 
        <i>expected</i> forms of words can&#146;t reach us?&#160; In other words, 
        that the &#147;new word,&#148; the &#147;news that stays news,&#148; is 
        yet to be invented for this moment?&#160; Perhaps, then, an innovative 
        poetics in the modernist or avant-garde tradition is precisely what is 
        needed?&#160; Or, is the failure of language a response to trauma that 
        any historical or personal disaster evokes?&#160; What sorts of poetry 
        can be responsive to such inadequacies?&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>And, further, how can poetry respond in a cultural 
        atmosphere that has wrought measures to revoke civil liberties?&#160; 
        Things over the last six months have hardly changed since the days following 
        9-11, when TV journalists were asked to sign statements of allegiance, 
        and others were chastised or dismissed for &#147;inappropriate&#148; critiques 
        of U.S. actions.&#160; It is a time when an academic forum (in October) 
        was denounced by the chancellor of his own university (CUNY) because faculty 
        present &#147;blamed United States foreign policy and capitalist cultural 
        messages&#148; as an underlying cause of the attacks.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><sup> [2] </sup></a>&#160; There are new surveillance and detention policies, 
        such as the sweeping USA Patriot Act.&#160; In the words of Nat Hentoff, 
        &#147;never in the history of the First Amendment has any suppression 
        of speech been so sweeping and difficult to contest as this one,&#148; 
        which allows the FBI to &#147;demand from bookstores and libraries the 
        names of books bought or borrowed by anyone suspected of involvement in 
        &#145;international terrorism&#146; or &#145;clandestine activities.&#146;&#148;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup> 
        [3] </sup></a>&#160; What becomes of writing and publishing in such a 
        climate?&#160; As one example, consider that Barnes and Noble refused 
        to carry Jonathan Tel&#146;s <i>Arafat&#146;s Elephant</i>, a collection 
        of short stories, unless the title was changed.&#160; (Since Tel refused, 
        of the big chains, only Borders is carrying the book.)&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>At the same time, in the midst of all this&#151;from 
        September 12 on&#151;has come a widespread circulation of poems by e-mail, 
        appearances in newspapers and in memorials (both &#147;official&#148; 
        and impromptu), with favorites including its own modernist canon of Moore, 
        Yeats, Heaney, Auden.&#160; Whose &#147;modernism&#148; is this?&#160; 
        Whose poetics provides such epigrammatic comforts? </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>There has been a clarion call for a new &#147;accessibility&#148; 
        in our poetry.&#160; Among others, this item from the <i>CLMP Newswire</i> 
        concerning New York City editors&#146; responses to &#147;9-11&#148;: 
        Martha Rhodes of Four Way Books describes &#147;looking more for the essential 
        in language and accessibility.&#160; For the leaner and meaner.&#148;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup> 
        [4] </sup></a></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>My own response to shock and speechlessness 
        in New York City was the opposite&#151;to need, desperately, for language 
        to be pushed outward or inward&#151;to change and be changed, to be charged, 
        remade.&#160; What might <i>that</i> new poetry look like?&#160; What 
        sources might it look back to?&#160; And who will be its readers?</p>
