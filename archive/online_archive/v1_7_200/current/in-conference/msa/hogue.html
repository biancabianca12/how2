          Rukeyser </p>
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>In response to Adorno&#146;s and Auden&#146;s 
        well-known despair, Alicia Ostriker reminds us that the poet Muriel Rukeyser 
        rejected both despair and apathy.&#160; Ostriker writes in her collection 
        of essays, <i>Dancing at the Devil&#146;s Party: Essays on Poetry, Politics, 
        and the Erotic</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>[T]here are those of us who disagree [with Auden and Adorno]. 
        . . . Poetry can, as Conrad puts it, make us <i>see</i>.&#160; It can 
        also, like Rilke&#146;s torso of Apollo, tell us that we must change our 
        lives.&#160; From time to time, some of us believe, poetry changes the 
        world.&#160; I am of this (perhaps dotty) persuasion and I have always 
        enjoyed the work of visionary artists dissatisfied with the rule of &#147;things 
        as they are&#148; (i)&#151;</blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>The issue so darkly raised by Auden and Adorno, 
        and opposed in terms of the life-affirming by Rukeyser and Ostriker herself, 
        has to do with the commensurability of aesthetics and ethics.&#160; It 
        is not wrong to subordinate art to history&#146;s horrors, in Ostriker&#146;s 
        view; she urges us, however, not to stop there.&#160; That is, as she 
        puts it, &#147;the struggle can neither be won nor abandoned&#148; (&#147;Beyond 
        Confession&#148; 35).&#160; The site of this struggle&#151;the witnessing, 
        the transmuting (i.e. the representing), the act of contemplative analysis 
        (or vision, if you will) that becomes the work of art&#151;is a place 
        where aesthetics and ethics can meet synergistically.&#160; Ostriker is 
        interested specifically in the poetics of postmodern witness.&#160; I 
        would like to consider, for the purposes of this essay, that synergistic 
        site itself, in order to contemplate more broadly an ethical poetics.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Although ethical criticism has burgeoned in 
        the last decade, and was even the topic of a recent <i>PMLA </i>issue 
        edited by Lawrence Buell, the term <i>ethics</i> is somewhat fluidly defined.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span> 
        [2] </span></a>&#160;&#160; For my purposes conceptually, I follow Julia 
        Kristeva in such early work as <i>Revolution in Poetic Language</i>, as 
        well as the later <i>Tales of Love</i>, <i>In the Beginning Was Love</i>, 
        and <i>Nations Without Nationalism,</i> because she theorizes both an 
        ethical subject and artistic practice.&#160; A practice is ethical, she 
        writes, &#147;when it dissolves those narcissistic fixations (ones that 
        are narrowly confined to the subject) to which the signifying process 
        succumbs in its sociosymbolic relation&#148; (<i>Revolution</i> 233<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span> 
        [3] </span></a>).&#160;&#160; The Law of the Symbolic is not simply internalized 
        but shattered-within-unity.&#160; An acknowledgment of the internal &#147;stranger 
        to ourselves&#148;&#151;what Emily Dickinson called&#160; &#147;Ourself&#160; 
        behind ourself&#148; (P 670)&#151;mobilizes a radically ethical tolerance 
        for external differences.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>I also follow Charles Altieri, who uses the 
        term <i>ethical</i>, in his essay &#147;What Is Living and What Is Dead 
        in Postmodernism,&#148; to characterize the desire on the part of postmodernist 
        artists both to extend modernist formal resistance to realist ideals and 
        marketplace values, and to offer more plausible ways than postmodern theory 
        has of imagining alternatives to dominant ideologies of mainstream culture:</p>
      <blockquote>Countering realism entails treating art less as a mode of referring 
        directly to the world than as an emphasis on the capacity of the artistic 
        syntax to exemplify ways of feeling, thinking, and imaginatively projecting 
        investments not bound to dominant social structures.<a href="#_edn4"
name="_ednref4" title=""><sup> [4] </sup></a>&#160;&#160; </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Concerned to theorize an expressivist ethics 
        that accords space and place to a moral and intentional subjectivity, 
        Altieri asserts that poets are better than theorists at envisioning poetic 
        subjects with agency, a &#147;dynamic intentionality&#148; that is inseparable 
        from that with which we imbue our speech (215).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span> 
        [5] </span></a>&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>I would like now to consider more specifically 
        the ethical stances of three exemplary poets: the syntax of thought and 
        emotion in their work, their thinking-through of dominance and one&#146;s 
        treatment of others.&#160; <i>&#160;</i>I focus on three poets whose works 
        are connected not only in their aesthetic innovativeness, but also in 
        being ethically motivated&#151;Marianne Moore, Alicia Ostriker, and Alice 
        Fulton.&#160; In listing these poets chronologically, I am loosely indicating 
        an American tradition of feminist, ethical poetics, but I will not specifically 
        be arguing that possibility in this essay.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>Moore&#146;s eccentric blend of liberal individualism 
        (which is at once an Enlightenment and Christian version<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span> 
        [6] </span></a>) and Modernist collage has camouflaged the ethical grain 
        against which she often writes.&#160; She developed &#147;an anti-poetic 
        mode of expression that rejected the self-centered, culturally imperialistic 
        assumptions of both the romantic and modernist eras as well&#148; (Miller 
        17).&#160; For Moore,&#160; &#147;a heteroglossic . . . intertext of voices 
        acts as a didactic tool of participatory education.&#160; No singular 
        and unambiguous voice instructs, but the poems push oppositionally toward 
        change&#148; (Miller 6).&#160; She construes such heteroglossic tension 
        as a kind of fortunate fall from the self-enclosed perfections of inherited 
        poetic tradition into the messy flaws of linguistic experiments.&#160; 
      </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>Flaws and imperfections in Moore&#146;s work 
        have ethical implications.&#160; As Laurence Stapleton suggests of a relatively 
        late poem, &#147;Tom Fool at Jamaica&#148; (1953) (originally titled &#147;Letter 
        Perfect is not Perfect&#148;), they mark &#147;a victory of sensibility 
        over everything in one&#146;s self or in others that defeats life&#148; 
        (189): &#147;Be infallible at your peril,&#148; Moore cautions (CP 162).&#160; 
        In perfect rhyming couplets of iambic tetrameter in &#147;Enough: <i>Jamestown, 
        1607-1957</i>,&#148; Moore jarringly distills the deadly essence of a 
        nascent capitalism in our imperfectly realized notions of freedom: &#147;Marriage, 
        tobacco, and slavery,/ initiated liberty&#148; (CP 186),<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span> 
        [7] </span></a>&#160; this liberty&#151;the colonists&#146; &#147;history 
        of treachery, genocide, and enslavement&#148; (Miller 151).&#160; She 
        portrays the colonists as concerned with fortune (&#147;a search for gold&#148; 
        [CP 186]) and fame (&#147;could the most ardent have been sure/ that they 
        had done what would endure?&#148; [CP 187]) rather than seeking ethically 
        &#147;what is good&#148; (CP 186).&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><i>Nothing </i>now marks the site of Jamestown&#151;&#147;the 
        site that did not flower&#148; (CP 186), she dryly closes, and because 
        of this erasure, &#147;it is <i>enough</i>/ if present faith mend partial 
        proof&#148; (CP 187; emphasis added): in other words, if we believe the 
        stories for lack of ample evidence.&#160; But these lines are ambiguous, 
        for &#147;mend&#148; means &#147;reform&#148; (in the religious sense 
        of <i>amend</i>, improve in <i>morals</i>) as well as &#147;repair,&#148; 
        and &#147;partial&#148; not only means &#147;in part&#148; but &#147;biased.&#148;&#160; 
        Having throughout the poem enumerated the colonists&#146; excesses (among 
        them cannibalism), Moore makes it difficult for readers to accept biased 
        versions (&#147;partial proofs&#148;) that whitewash (&#147;mend&#148;) 
        the colonists&#146; reprehensible record.&#160; It is &#147;enough&#148; 
        only <i>if</i>&#151;the conditional (in)conclusively eloquent&#151;the 
        present, through spiritual belief, can correct the flaws (both of character 
        and culture) that caused past wrongs. </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>Moore was a pacifist (albeit not a passivist), 
        and her question in the fifties, in the wake of McCarthy&#146;s interrogations 
        of &#147;un-American&#148; activities, the Korean War, and the atom bomb 
        testing<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span> [8] </span></a> 
        was how to valorize &#147;American&#148; individuality without encouraging 
        &#147;egomania.&#148;&#160; As the speaker of another late poem, &#147;Blessed 
        Is the Man,&#148; remarks, &#147;Blessed the geniuses who know// that 
        egomania is not a duty&#148; (CP 173).&#160; The poem continues: </p>
      <UL>
        Blessed the man whose faith is different<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from possessiveness&#151;of a kind not framed 
        by &#147;things which <br>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <ul>

                      <ul>
                        do appear&#148;&#151;<br>
                        (<i>CP</i> 174) 
                      </ul>
                    </ul>

          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>The issue Moore raises is how to promote self-possession 
        without possessive individualism.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>This poem was published in <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> 
        in 1956, six years before C.B. MacPherson&#146;s &#147;classic analysis 
        of Western &#145;possessive individualism&#146; (1962) trace[d] the seventeenth-century 
        emergence of an ideal self as owner: the [white, male] individual surrounded 
        by accumulated property,&#148; as James Clifford, in his chapter on collecting 
        art and culture in his own classic analysis, <i>The Predicament of Culture</i>, 
        summarizes the ideological paradigm shift that so vitally contributed 
        to the philosophical foundations of America (Clifford 217).&#160; As &#147;Blessed 
        Is the Man&#148; confirms, Moore contemplated the tension that characterizes 
        the American ideal of individualism&#151;that is, the Lockean possessive 
        individual and the Washingtonion individual whose civic-mindedness tempers 
        the self-aggrandizing, bourgeois individual&#146;s unfettered quest for 
        profit.&#160; The poem blesses &#147;the man who does not denigrate, depreciate, 
        denunciate,&#148; or &#147;comply&#148;; advocates &#147;&#145;Diversity, 
        controversy; tolerance&#146;&#148;; and employs a metaphor from the language 
        of housekeeping to portray moral vacuity&#151;condemning those authors 
        &#147;<i>mitin</i>-proofing conscience against character&#148; (who, in 
        other words, put their conscience in &#147;mothballs&#148;).</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>In the late 1940s, after her mother&#146;s 
        death, Moore very publicly refashioned herself as a Washingtonian figure, 
        positioning herself as a sort of transvestite &#147;founding father&#148; 
        in order to assert a voice authoritative enough to be heard.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span> 
        [9] </span></a>&#160; Her self-fashioning made visible and readable some 
        of the tensions among self-aggrandizing, American individualism, radically 
        Christian ethics, and liberal democracy,<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span> 
        [10] </span></a> which dominant cultural ideology in the U.S. covers over.&#160; 
        But she had long considered the linking of <i>poet</i> and <i>prophet,</i> 
        which was best exemplified for her in the Bible.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>Take as illustration the poem that contains 
        lines often quoted as metapoetic, &#147;The Past is the Present.&#148;&#160; 
        The lines are: &#147;Ecstasy affords/ the occasion and expediency determines 
        the form&#148; (<i>CP </i>88).&#160; The poem continues: &#147;&#145;Hebrew 
        poetry is prose/ with a sort of heightened consciousness&#146;&#148; (<i>CP</i> 
        88).&#160; The equivalence of Hebrew poetry with prose, formally asserted 
        by the line break after &#147;prose,&#148; is put into question by the 
        enjambed semantic qualification.&#160; Is prose &#147;&#145;with a <i>sort 
        of</i> heightened consciousness&#146;&#148; (emphasis added) poetry, prose, 
        or something in between?&#160; Moore&#146;s notes attribute this quoted 
        statement to Dr. E. H. Kellogg of Carlisle, Pennsylvania.&#160; In a poem 
        that takes up as <i>an issue</i> another kind of repetition&#151;rhyme, 
        which it notes is &#147;outmoded&#148;&#151;why is the poem&#146;s speaker 
        concerned with repeating Dr. Kellogg&#146;s words precisely (&#147;He 
        said&#151;and I think I repeat his exact words&#148;)?&#160; Why quote 
        precisely what may be, after all, Dr. Kellogg&#146;s oratorial hemming 
        and hawing (&#147;sort of&#148;), which obscures rather than clarifies 
        the precise nature of Hebrew poetry?&#160; Why introduce a phrase that 
        calls into question the accuracy of the quotation, moreover (&#147;I think&#148;), 
        or open the poem in the conditional (&#148;<i>If</i> external action is 
        effete/ <i>and</i> rhyme is outmoded,/ [<i>then</i>] I shall revert to 
        you,/ Habakkuk&#148;; emphasis added)?&#160; And why redefine such a crucial 
        word as ecstasy so oddly (a &#147;sort of heightened consciousness&#148;)?&#160; 
        The poem takes formal issue with a Modernist economy forbidding verbal 
        excess, not only through the poem&#146;s witty repetition of prolix masculine 
        authority but also through its internal and off-rhyme (words/affords, 
        verse/prose, effete/repeat) and abjuration of conventional notions of 
        &#147;ecstasy.&#148;&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>This poetic rumination on a &#147;Bible class&#148; 
        is a notably odd Modernist moment.&#160; But in effect, Moore posits her 
        own revised relation to masculine poetic tradition on a par with Pound&#146;s 
        and Eliot&#146;s poetic individualism (Slatin 30).&#160; As Habakkuk&#146;s 
        name signifies, the poem replaces classical with Judeo-Christian tradition.&#160; 
        &#147;Of the prophet Habakkuk,&#148; we are told in Moore&#146;s source, 
        &#147;we know nothing that is personal save his name,&#148; which is unusual 
        even in Hebrew&#151;an intensive form of a root meaning &#147;to caress 
        or embrace.&#148;<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"
title=""><span> [11] </span></a>&#160; Jerome, a note further tells us, suggested 
        that Habakkuk was &#147;called &#145;embrace&#146; either because of his 
        love to the Lord, or because he wrestles with God.&#148;&#160; Luther 
        suggested that &#147;Habakkuk means one who comforts and holds up his 
        people as one embraces a weeping person&#148; (129).&#160; Habakkuk was 
        the earliest of a new school of religion in Israel, and was an atypical 
        &#147;prophet,&#148; for unlike the other prophets, who addressed Israel 
        on behalf of God, Habakkuk was a skeptic who addressed God on behalf of 
        Israel.&#160; Moore&#146;s other quotations from <i>The Book of the Twelve</i> 
        in her reading diary note that the Hebrew ecstatics were not selfish (unlike 
        modern Christian fanatics); that they were &#147;in sympathy with their 
        nation&#146;s aspirations for freedom and her whole political life&#148; 
        (vol. 1, 25); and that the &#147;age was very modern&#148;&#151;noted 
        for its joy, energy, patriotism, devoutness, and &#147;cruel wealth.&#148;<a
href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span> [12] </span></a>&#160; Writing 
        during the First World War (but before the United States entered it), 
        Moore must have contemplated the analogies between the tumultuous age 
        that produced the Old Testament prophets and her own&#151;even, perhaps, 
        between Habakkuk and herself.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span> 
        [13] </span></a>&#160; In reverting to &#147;Habakkuk&#148; because &#147;external 
        action is effete,&#148; then, she openly, if discreetly, declares that 
        an expedient form for action is poetry and the ecstasy that informs her 
        work a reversion of Old Testament skepticism, which serves as an analogue 
        of her very individual embodiment of an ethical poet-prophet. </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>Like Moore&#146;s modernism, Alice Fulton&#146;s 
        postmodernist poetic project resists a poetry comprised of particular 
        (often exclusively personal and narrative) details, as well as the lyric 
        engagement of only those emotions deemed appropriate by mainstream poetics.&#160; 
        For Fulton, the problematic is that there are so few emotions represented 
        in the lyric that it has narrowed the range of the possible.&#160; Desire 
        and grief have long since &#147;consolidated into genre&#148; (<i>Feeling</i> 
        300); ordinary language is uncritically prized as a symptom of &#147;sincerity&#148;; 
        linguistic play&#151;a central aspect of poetry, at least in English poetry 
        since the Old English riddles&#151;is considered florid and insincere 
        (and sometimes hysterically overwrought).&#160; </p>
      <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='line-height:200%'>What both of these 
        poets implicitly call for is a less visually, formally, and thematically 
        stabilized poetry&#151;a poetry that is on the verge or at the edge, one 
        that does play tennis without the net (and out of bounds to boot!).&#160; 
        Fulton has termed the kind of poetry she has in mind fractal verse,<span style='font-style:normal'> 
        after the term that mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot used (from the Latin 
        </span>fractus: &#147;irregular or fragmented&#148;) for structures of 
        natural turbulence previously thought to be chaotic.&#160; Mandelbrot 
        discovered the deep patterns or logic (see Feeling 62-63, passim) of roots 
        and leaves, for example, or clouds or arteries.<a href="#_edn14"
name="_ednref14" title=""><span> [14] </span></a>&#160; Fulton is interested in 
        a poetry open to the fluctuations of consciousness, mindfulness, openheartedness.&#160; 
        She describes it as being cast in &#147;that point of metamorphosis, when 
        structure is incipient, all threshold, a neither-nor&#148; (Feeling <span
style='font-style:normal'>63), and as having a sense of the nonbinarizing, the 
        peripheral that Lynn Keller has called, following Fulton herself, the 
        &#147;</span>then some inbetween.&#148;<a
href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span> [15] </span></a>&#160; </p>
      <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='line-height:
200%'>Here, in that place of edges, doorways, and openings, just as the old identity 
        has been dropped but before the new one has been taken on, we find a maximalist 
        poetics of liminality (in Victor Turner&#146;s sense of the creative betwixt-and-between 
        of culturally organized categories) capable of engaging the reader in 
        less emotionally predictable ways.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span> 
        [16] </span></a>&#160; Fulton explains:</p>
      <blockquote>I&#146;m interested in poems that engage with those untoward 
        emotions, going off the given emotional scripts to write the peripheral 
        and unvisited.&#160; Such poetry will disappoint the genteel expectations 
        of genre, but it stands a chance of surprising me into <i>feeling</i>. 
        (<i>Feeling</i> 300; emphasis added)</blockquote>
      <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='line-height:200%'>For Fulton, the most 
        interesting poetry engages a reader&#146;s mind with <i>something-larger-than</i> 
        the self.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Like Moore&#146;s, Fulton&#146;s poetry is distinguished 
        by its eclectic and flexible linguistic innovation and, Emily Grosholz 
        argues, its negotiation of, attendance to, the demands of accessibility 
        (213).<a href="#_edn17"
name="_ednref17" title=""><span> [17] </span></a>&#160; To this assertion, however, 
        I want to add the caveat that, as with her great precursor, Fulton has 
        never let the &#147;demands of accessibility&#148;&#151;as much a contested 
        issue in current poetics as it was in Moore&#146;s day (see Keller 311-14, 
        <i>passim</i>)&#151;constrain or determine the formal and contextual explorations 
        in her work.&#160; That is because, Fulton argues, so much of the poetry 
        which attends to those demands is not, in practice, concerned with substantive 
        issues&#151;&#147;conscience, responsibility, power, cruelty, or <i>form</i>&#147;&#151; 
        but is relentless in its concern with the self.&#160; Its investigations 
        are not ontological, epistemological, or ethical, but &#147;solipsistic&#148; 
        (<i>Feeling </i>282).&#160; She asks exasperatedly, <i>Can we talk about 
        something else</i> (i.e. than the self)? (<i>Feeling</i> 303).&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>As a self-identified feminist, postmodern poet, 
        one who, from the first, has been as theoretically astute as the Language 
        poets, Fulton has explored multiple (re)constructions of the lyric subject, 
        disengendering as well as regendering it.&#160; In doing so, she both 
        attends to the personal and opens her work to that which lies outside 
        the individual (Miller 319).<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18"
title=""><span> [18] </span></a>&#160; She is interested in an exploratory inquiry 
        that will discomfit readers and unsettle their expectations, a poetry 
        of <i>inconvenient</i> knowledge (the title of one of her most important 
        essays).&#160; She favors the eccentric, calls for a maximalist poetry 
        of &#147;odd, postmodern rapture&#148; (akin to that Moorean ecstasy of 
        the &#147;sort of heightened consciousness&#148;)&#151;that is, a formal 
        excess and emotive content which will unhinge foundational assumptions 
        (<i>Feeling </i>302). </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>I want now to turn to a specific example in 
        Fulton&#146;s recent collection, <i>Felt</i>, the title of which obviously 
        functions symbolically as both noun (the fabric) and verb (the past tense 
        of <i>feel</i>).&#160; In a poem that takes up this symbolic potential, 
        &#147;Fair Use,&#148; Fulton describes how the fabric felt is made (&#147;by 
        pressing/ fibers till they can&#146;t be wrenched apart&#148; [<i>Felt</i> 
        17]).<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span> [19] </span></a>&#160; 
        Although I have quoted the passage separately, lifted it out as I might 
        a piece of the fabric so that you can see how it feels, it cannot really 
        be taken out of its context without skewing the sense of Fulton&#146;s 
        methodology.&#160; Here&#146;s the passage reconstituted:</p>
      <ul>
        As for the sofa, its fabric is vermiculite,<br>
        glittering, as is trans-<br>
        ferment.&#160; My head&#146;s already in its sixties flip.<br>
        Kennedy&#146;s already dead.&#160; Incandescence<br>
        has a heavy hand.&#160; For all I care,<br>
        the TV might be an airshaft<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          when the statics of <i>is</i> widen and show everyone<br>
          meshed, a fabric of entanglement = =<br>
          my consciousness felted with yours,<br>
          although I didn&#146;t know you then.<br>
          <br>
          It is not metaphorical, the giver is<br>
          literal beyond prediction about this:<br>
          what happens to others happens to me.<br>
          What joy, what sad.&#160; As felt<br>
          <br>
        </ul>
        is formed by pressing <br>
        fibers till they can&#146;t be wrenched apart,<br>
        nothing is separate, the entire planet<br>
        being an unexpected example.<br>
        Is this fair use, to find<br>
        <br>
        <ul>

          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>This is a poem that posits the insight that 
        we are all interconnected on this planet, and moves into a contemplation 
        of our capacity to feel others&#146; feelings: a sense of having &#147;interfelt,&#148; 
        as the poem puts it towards the end.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>The poem opens in apparent <i>in media res </i>(&#147;As 
        for the sofa...&#148;) but never fastens upon a story line.&#160; The 
        personal and historical details (&#147;My head&#146;s already in its sixties 
        flip,/ Kennedy&#146;s already dead&#148;) locate us chronologically but 
        not purposefully (as in: developing the movement that the opening lines 
        trigger).&#160; The first indented section (&#147;when the statics of 
        <i>is</i> widen . . .&#148;) substantively widens the poem, which becomes 
        suddenly&#151;coinciding with the indentation&#151;an ontological contemplation.&#160; 
        The poem then shifts abruptly into analogy and neologistic pun (&#147;my 
        consciousness <i>felted</i> with yours&#148;).&#160; Then, with the move 
        back to flush left, it shifts to definition (&#147;As felt// is formed 
        by pressing/ fibers till they can&#146;t be wrenched apart&#148;) felted 
        (as it were) with extended metaphor.&#160; As fabric and as sign registering 
        an emotional experience, the word <i>felt</i> is posited, through the 
        flux of the poem&#146;s shifting focus, as both the ground and figure 
        for the transcendent epiphany at the heart of this poem (&#147;nothing 
        is separate, the entire planet&#148;).&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>As a fabric formed by &#147;pressing/ fibers 
        till they can&#146;t be wrenched apart,&#148; felt is a seeming but complex 
        image expressed in an unseemly&#151;even violent&#151;language (the violence 
        latent in <i>wrenched</i>, for example).&#160;&#160; The poem, too, is 
        a complex of affective forces.&#160; Formally, it foregrounds its seams 
        (&#147;a fabric of entanglement = =&#148;).&#160; Thematically, it renders 
        an insight&#151;that &#147;nothing is separate, the entire planet&#148;&#151;wherein 
        science (specifically the Gaia hypothesis that we live in a living world 
        in which we are all interconnected) and spirituality (specifically Buddhism) 
        meet.&#160; Thus, as Fulton might explain, the poem&#146;s complexity 
        happens at the level of lining as well as line.&#160; To give a few examples: 
      </p>
      <ul style='line-height: 200%'>
        <li>The word <i>felt</i> morphs from verb to noun over the course of an 
          enjambed stanza break (&#147;What joy, what sad.&#160; As felt// is 
          formed...); 
        <li>later in the poem Fulton employs a neologism, <i>interfelt</i>, for 
          the kind of entanglement of hearts that she both thematically resists 
          (&#147;students = = teachers = = parents = = children = =/ get your 
          hearts out of mine&#148; [<i>Felt </i>19] and formally contemplates; 
        <li>and this is akin to that moment of graphic severing = = and = = connection 
          accomplished by Fulton&#146;s innovative use of the double equal sign 
          (much like Emily Dickinson&#146;s use of the dash, of course&#151;&#147;severing 
          self from = = nonself&#148;&#151; as well as A.R. Ammons democratizing 
          use of the colon).&#160; 
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>In other words, the poem is formally structured 
        by a series of scenic, substantive, and typographic confluences, meeting-places 
        (for the personal and historical, for example, or the scientific and spiritual, 
        among others), enacting what Fulton terms &#147;the content of form&#148; 
        (<i>Feeling </i>69).&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>The stays of abstraction that underpin this 
        poem&#151; &#147;transferment&#148; = = &#147;incandescence&#148; = = 
        &#147;consciousness&#148; = = &#147;immersion&#148; = = &#147;radiance&#148; 
        = = &#147;synthesis&#148;&#160;= = &#147;interfelt&#148; = = &#147;thousandfold&#148; 
        = = &#147;hearts&#148;&#151;form the dense, emotional texture of&#160; 
        epiphany at the poem&#146;s heart.&#160; As Ostriker remarks of the engaged 
        and ritual poetry that&#160; &#147;suggests nonoppressive models of the 
        conjunction between religion and politics, usually by re-imaging the sacred 
        as immanent rather than transcendent,&#148; there is no transcendence 
        in this poem.&#160; Rather, here Fulton&#146;s poetry echoes Moore&#146;s 
        in its contemplation of the value of immersion, saturation&#151;<i>excess 
        of feeling.&#160; </i>&#160;I want to suggest that this excess is associated 
        with Fulton&#146;s ethical sense of <i>compassion</i>.&#160; As she construes 
        this notion central to Buddhism, compassion is that communal capacity 
        to feel <i>with</i> rather than the distancing effect of feeling <i>for&#151;</i>a 
        sympathy often mouthed but hardly felt in American culture (although it 
        seems clear that September 11<sup>th</sup> has changed that fact).&#160; 
        Instead of the self-delusions of sympathy, the poem enjoins us through 
        its mindfulness, its mindful contemplation of vertiginously swift shifts, 
        to immerse ourselves, to risk the too-muchness of others&#146; feelings, 
        from which we ordinarily&#151;unmindfully&#151;try to protect ourselves.&#160; 
        To let the world in, close the distance, lower the veil that separates 
        &#147;self from = = nonself&#148;: to <i>interfeel.</i>&#160;&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>I&#146;d like to close by turning briefly to 
        Alicia Ostriker, who has become, as Fulton&#146;s poem allows us to see, 
        a poet who risks the too-muchness of others&#146; feelings.&#160; In the 
        essay &#147;&#145;Howl&#146; Revisited: the Poet as Jew,&#148; Ostriker 
        contends that Alan Ginsberg&#146;s Jewishness was at least as crucial 
        to his poetics as Buddhism:</p>
      <blockquote>There is a word in Hebrew for a virtue at the core of Ginsberg&#146;s 
        character and his writing, a virtue that has been noticed by infinite 
        numbers of people&#151;<i>chesed</i>.&#160; It means kindness, or lovingkindness.&#160; 
        (103)</blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Because of the thoroughness of her study of 
        Judaism, Ostriker is able persuasively to contextualize what others have 
        noticed and attributed solely to Ginsberg&#146;s Buddhism.&#160; She then 
        goes on to link his work&#146;s commentary on America to the role of &#147;prophet&#148; 
        (as in Old Testament Hebrew prophecy).&#160; She contends that no full 
        understanding of Ginsberg&#146;s tragicomic sensibility&#151;the link 
        between The Book of Lamentations and &#147;Howl,&#148; to take a specific 
        example&#151;is possible without taking into account Ginsberg&#146;s formative 
        Jewishness. </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>I would say, of course, that we may not only 
        see from her commentary useful connections to Moore&#146;s public persona, 
        but also to Ostriker&#146;s own work as a revisionary Jewish, feminist 
        poet.&#160; In Ostriker&#146;s case, the later poetry especially is complicated 
        and deepened by the methodology of midrashic collage and the ethics of 
        <i>chesed</i>, of &#147;lovingkindness,&#148; which permeate the vision 
        central to her oeuvre.&#160;&#160; In her moving poem &#147;The Class,&#148; 
        Ostriker assembles into the overarching narrative of the teacher&#146;s 
        compassion for her students her students&#146; own words, multiplying 
        the perspectives in the poem so that, like a prism fracturing light into 
        a spectrum, the poem contains the comic as well as tragic:</p>
      <ul>
        We say things in this class.&#160; Like why it hurts.<br>
        ..................<br>
        The teacher hears tales from the combat zone<br>
        Where the children live . . . . .<br>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            Like all draftees, 
          </ul>
        </ul>
        They have one job, survival,<br>
        And permit themselves some jokes.<br>
        <i>Like my father hits the bottle . . .</i><br>
        <i>And my mother.&#160; </i>[And]<br>
        .................................<br>
        The homosexual drummer tapping out<br>
        A knee tune, wagging his Groucho brows.<br>
        <i>Hey, you ought to meet my mom real soon.</i><br>
        <i>&#145;Cause when I tell her, she&#146;s gonna die. </i>(194) 
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>The teacher hears the students&#146; &#147;common 
        stories&#148; (the choice of common both precisely descriptive and ironic) 
        of surviving incest, rape, abuse of all sorts, attempted suicide, and 
        knows that, in challenging her students to &#147;Write what makes you 
        afraid to write,&#148; she &#147;helps them descend into hell&#148; (<i>The 
        Little Space</i> 195).&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'>This surprising counsel is, as it turns out, 
        because what she knows from her experience of giving permission, in the 
        space of the classroom, for her students &#147;To gather pain into language&#148; 
        is that:</p>
      <ul>
        The critics are wrong, the other professors are wrong<br>
        Who describe an art divisible from dirt,<br>
        From rotten life.&#160; (195) 
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Rather than submit finally and absolutely to 
        despair over art&#146;s powerlessness in the face of horror, which can 
        render the pain unsurvivable (as it was for the subject of Adorno&#146;s 
        contemplation, Paul Celan, as Ostriker well understands), she insists 
        on the relevance, the connection of art to all with which &#147;dirt&#148; 
        is metonymically associated.&#160; Poets confronting all to which &#147;rotten 
        life&#148; refers, Ostriker suggests in a recent essay, might contemplate 
        a line from the Talmudic <i>Ethics of the Fathers</i>: &#147;It is not 
        incumbent on you to finish the task.&#160; Neither are you free to give 
        it up&#148; (&#147;Beyond Confession&#148; 35).&#160; Adorno himself, 
        we might recall, admitted the necessity of what we now term a poetry of 
        witness.&#160; He wrote in <i>Negative Dialectics:</i> </p>
      <blockquote>Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured 
        man has to scream, hence it may have been wrong to say that after Auschwitz 
        you could no longer write poems.&#160; But it is not wrong to raise the 
        less cultural question whether after Auschwitz you can go on living.&#160; 
        (362-63)<a
href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span> [20] </span></a> </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>As a critic, Ostriker advocates and herself 
        writes as a poet a poetry that has an &#147;intensely engaged and engaging&#148; 
        speaking subject.&#160; Like Ginsberg (and Moore in her later years,), 
        Ostriker favors a performative, ritual poetry in which:</p>
      <blockquote>The poet . . .enacts a bardic, shamaness&#146; or priestess&#146; 
        role, enacting a modern version of the theme of transformation common 
        to tribal ceremonies in ancient Europe, Britain, America, and Africa. 
        . . . For poet and reader-participant alike, ritual poetry implies the 
        possibility of healing alternatives to dominance-submission scenarios.&#160; 
        It suggests nonoppressive models of the conjunction between religion and 
        politics, usually by re-imaging the sacred as immanent rather than transcendent, 
        by defining its audience as members of a potentially strong community[.] 
        (16-17)</blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>To write a defense of poetry by excavating 
        its archaic function, Ostriker articulates a position located at the juncture 
        of the political and the spiritual, that is both ethical and revolutionary.&#160; 
        It is an astonishingly romantic stance for a major poet-critic at the 
        beginning of the twenty-first century.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>But, you may recall, Kristeva also theorizes 
        the importance of the subject position in poetry: its capacity to dissolve 
        narcissistic fixations, its association with social practices that destabilize 
        social structures and the privileging of the privileged&#151;esoterism, 
        shamanism, and carnival, for example&#151;because like them, she argues, 
        poetry&#146;s language demystifies the unifying operations of the symbolic. 
      </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'>Artist and activist Suzi Gablik contends that 
        the artistic process of dissolving ego-boundaries poses a visionary response 
        to what she calls the &#147;modern challenge&#148;:</p>
      <blockquote>To find sacredness within the world, to recover our lost souls, 
        to somehow get past what George Steiner recently described as &#147;the 
        age of embarrassment about God, about the numinous, the collective unconsciousness; 
        embarrassment about owning to our inner world, transcendental experience, 
        mysteries, and magnanimities.&#148;&#160; (quoted. in Gablik at 53)</blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Gablik suggests, in <i>The Reenchantment of 
        Art,</i> that the ethical aspect of the artistic practice might be usefully 
        termed reconstructive (rather than revolutionary), concerned as it is 
        with ways of changing our minds, our mindsets, our socialization into, 
        our complicity with, oppression (Gablik 17)&#151;and after last week&#146;s 
        horrific act, I want to add: with violence.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>To return in closing to Ostriker&#146;s poem 
        &#147;The Class,&#148; what the teacher sees and hears&#151;what Ostriker 
        (following Rukeyser and Carolyn Forch&#233;) terms a poetics of <i>witness</i>&#151;generates 
        the poem.&#160; But what she is portrayed as believing&#151;and this teacher 
        is paradigmatic for the ethical vision of the prophet-poet Ostriker envisions&#151;is 
        that against all evidence &#147;Poetry heals, or redeems suffering,/ If 
        we can enter its house of judgment&#148; (to believe ourselves, we might 
        recall Moore&#146;s line: <i>it is enough if present faith mend partial 
        proof</i>).&#160; Whose suffering does poetry redeem and whom does it 
        heal?&#160; If not the poet herself, the teacher thinks, perhaps a reader 
        years later, for:&#160; &#147;<i>Great is truth</i>,&#148; she tells herself, 
        <i>&#147;and mighty above all things&#148;</i> (195).&#160; She cannot 
        say this in her class, for the students would think her dotty, of course.&#160; 
        What she can quietly give them in the position that she occupies is <i>chesed</i>, 
        &#147;lovingkindness,&#148; the strand of which is one thread running 
        through the collaged narrative.&#160; Years later, one of her students 
        may read the poem, and themselves be in a position to pass on the vision.&#160; 
      </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>I am not suggesting that any of these poets 
        calls for a larger systemic change, though it&#146;s arguable.&#160; Rather, 
        I contend that these poets ethically, spiritually explore in their work 
        what is possible at the individual level, where we have subjective agency 
        and can effect change&#151;if <i>only </i>a change of heart.&#160; As 
        Moore put it in &#147;In Distrust of Merits,&#148; lines that resonate 
        eerily for me as the nation responds to the September 11th terrorist attack: 
        &#147;We/ vow, we make this promise//to the fighting&#151;it&#146;s a 
        promise&#151;&#145;We&#146;ll/ never hate black, white, red, yellow, Jew,/ 
        Gentile, <i>Muslim</i>&#147;: &#147;There never was a war that was/ not 
        inward; I must/ fight till I have conquered in myself what/ causes war&#148; 
        (<i>CP</i> 137-38).</p>

          for example, with the headline &#147;Queen Juliana Warns That Time is 
          Short for Humanity to Save Itself by World Unity&#148;:</p>

          In world-consciousness and respect for the freedom of others lies a 
          great mental power which is yours.&#148;&#160; In May 1956, Moore quotes 
          Herbert Hoover and Hugh Gibson from the Quaker calendar: &#147;Victory 
          with vengeance is ultimate defeat in the modern world.&#160; We can

          thicken the case for why liberal means of defending democratic values 
          are worth pursuing, for why a political theory adequate to modern society 
          must emphasize rules and attitudes oriented towards cultivating and 
          tolerating incommensurable differences, and for how one can correlate 
          democratic individualism with the social constraints necessary to negotiate 
          those differences.&#160; Expressivism shows why agents have interests 
          in democracy that go beyond capitalist market principles, and it can 
          help explain how we can care about freedoms for those whose primary 
          values we find incommensurable with ours&#148; (222).&#160; I think
