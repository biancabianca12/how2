      <BLOCKQUOTE>It is, sadly, in the context of atrocity that a politics of 
        difficulty must evolve; it is in such a politics (and in the artistic 
        activity that would shape it) that the substance of meaningfulness will 
        be able to appear.</BLOCKQUOTE>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'>For many who haven&#146;t thought of W. H. 
        Auden since their sophomore literature survey, the events of September 
        11, 2001 snapped the poem &#147;September 1, 1939&#148; back into focus.&#160; 
        As German aircraft attacked Poland, Auden sat, he tells us,</p>
      <UL>
        <UL>
          . . . in one of the dives<BR>
          On Fifty-second Street<br>
          Uncertain and afraid<br>
          As the clever hopes expire<br>
          Of a low dishonest decade:<br>
          Waves of anger and fear<br>
          Circulate over the bright<br>
          And darkened lands of the earth,<br>
          Obsessing our private lives;<br>
          The unmentionable odour of death<br>
          Offends the September night.&#160; (57)
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'>When the twin towers collapsed again and yet 
        again on television screens across the globe, New York took its place 
        in the westward push of T. S. Eliot&#146;s <i>Waste Land</i> catalogue: 
        &#147;Falling towers,&#148; Eliot wrote, &#147;Jerusalem Athens Alexandria 
        / Vienna London / Unreal.&#148;&#160; Among the multitude of poems sent 
        across listservs, printed in newspapers, and recited at memorials, &#147;September 
        1, 1939,&#148; &#147;The Waste Land,&#148; and H.D.&#146;s <i>Trilogy 
        </i>slid into position as prophecy, prayer, and consolation.&#160; The 
        rhythms, words, and ritual space of these poems provide focus and a semblance 
        of solace for those who invoke them.&#160; To aid and abet acceptance 
        of loss, provide words to speak into silence, and reconstitute a sense 
        of shared history and values is key cultural work. </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>It is the contention of this paper, however, that poetry has another 
        role to fill in a time of atrocity.&#160; Against the short-term intimacies 
        of consolation, I want to invoke a long-term, large-scale, propositional 
        poetics: a poetics of difficulty which at its best participates in the 
        creation of a politics of difficulty.&#160; As I hope to show through 
        a consideration of Ezra Pound and Leslie Scalapino, although such a poetics 
        is not always&#151;or only&#151;progressive, its methods are crucial in 
        times of atrocity.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>In so far as Scalapino is an innovative rather than a lyrical or 
        meditative poet, she occupies a place in the lineage of Pound, but these 
        two poets make a very odd couple: Pound&#146;s rants, his flights of egoism, 
        and his flirtation with Fascism clash with Scalapino&#146;s attenuations, 
        the koan-like elusiveness of her writing, and her corrosive contempt for 
        bullies and tyrants.&#160; There are, however, similarities that align 
        the propositional poetics of these two writers as a thinking toward action 
        or, perhaps better, a thinking <i>as</i> action.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>Both Pound and Scalapino are poets of impassioned regard for and 
        address to the public world.&#160; They write within a global network 
        of histories, governments, economies, and texts.&#160; They mess with 
        newspapers, talk like comic books, and, if they could, would publish their 
        work, as Scalapino puts it, &#147;on billboards or outdoors as murals&#148; 
        (<i>Front Matter</i> 1).&#160; While they write in public and to the public, 
        however, they write against conventional public thought.&#160; Their default 
        mode is oppositional, assuming the worst of a greedy, hate-filled, and 
        delusional populace prepared to follow craven leaders into disastrous 
        wars.&#160; Their enormous impatience with institutionalized fraud and 
        stupidity feeds a creativity that takes its shape as an alternate form 
        of intelligence.</p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>The first stanza of Auden&#146;s poem, although clipped, goes with, 
        rather than against, the grain of public thought.&#160; Comfortingly mimetic 
        and hypotactic, its elements bind real-world referents into recognizable 
        patterns of reasoning.&#160; When Auden tells us he sits &#147;in one 
        of the dives / on Fifty-second Street,&#148; we place him in a midtown 
        Manhattan bar; when he says he sits there <i>as</i> &#147;clever hopes 
        expire,&#148; we know these hopes come to an end both <i>at the moment 
        that</i> and <i>because</i> &#147;[w]aves of anger and fear&#148; escalate 
        into war.&#160; In Auden&#146;s stanza, the all but invisible <i>as </i>anchors 
        the reader firmly in a cause-and-effect world of dependent and subordinate 
        syntactical relationships.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>As poets, Pound and Scalapino think&#151;and, when they are successful, 
        induce their readers to think&#151;paratactically.&#160; Propositions 
        in their poems swing free, that is, both conceptually and syntactically.&#160; 
        Pound begins Canto 3, in the same manner as Auden begins &#147;September 
        1, 1939&#148;&#151;&#147;I sat on the Dogana&#146;s steps,&#148; he writes, 
        &#147;<i>For</i> the gondolas cost too much, that year&#148;&#151;but 
        two lines is as far as he can go in a hypotactic vein.&#160; The rest 
        of the canto, like the larger matrix into which it fits, is articulated 
        by the <i>and</i>&#146;s and <i>or</i>&#146;s of parataxis: the lit cross-beams 
        in the palace <i>and</i> the peacocks in Kor&#233;&#146;s house <i>and</i> 
        bright gods in the azure air <i>or</i> gray steps under the cedars; El 
        Cid on the run <i>and</i> Ignez da Castro murdered <i>and</i> plaster 
        flaking from a wall once painted by Mantegna.&#160; This is the method 
        Scalapino identifies in Philip Whalen&#146;s writing as &#147;all layers 
        at the same time&#148; (&#147;Radical Nature&#148; 4).&#160; I will call 
        it, for the moment, the <i>and-effect</i>.</p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>The most efficient way to read Canto 3 is to articulate its components 
        by moving deliberately&#151;with deliberation&#151;from things to concepts.&#160; 
        This is the opposite of conventional thought, which tends, like the canto&#146;s 
        opening lines, to hinge on pre-given cause-and-effect relationships: I 
        sat on the steps, Pound says, <i>because</i> I didn&#146;t have money 
        to take a gondola.&#160; Not interesting.&#160; The rest of the canto, 
        however, applies a lesson Pound learned from Fenollosa&#146;s <i>Chinese 
        Written Character as a Medium for Poetry.</i>&#160; Confronted with the 
        ideograms for &#147;flamingo&#148; <i>and</i> &#147;cherry&#148; <i>and</i> 
        &#147;iron-rust&#148; <i>and</i> &#147;sunset,&#148; Fenollosa tells us, 
        an active reader, at first baffled, will bust through sooner or later 
        into the idea of <i>red</i>.&#160; Confronted with Canto 3&#146;s scenes 
        of exile <i>and</i> banishment <i>and</i> neglect <i>and</i> public indifference 
        to art, a reader will come to the idea of <i>cultural corruption</i>.&#160; 
        Epistemology is the action of the poem.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>The purpose of the <i>and-effect</i>, then, is to build conceptual 
        categories from the ground up, thus dissolving what Fenollosa called &#147;the 
        discredited, or rather the useless, logic of the Middle Ages&#148; (CWC 
        12) and allowing a reader to&#151;in Harryette Mullen&#146;s phrase&#151;&#147;think 
        toward action&#148; (Bedient 661).&#160; One should open the gates of 
        Burgos to El Cid; one should maintain Mantegna&#146;s frescos; one should 
        make sure poets have the means to navigate the canals of the city of lights.&#160; 
        The result of thinking upward through the <i>and-effect</i> is the dissolution 
        of public clich&#233;s&#151;that art is a luxury, for example, or that 
        men of forceful will are dangerous to the well-being of the state.&#160; 
        This kind of category-busting, for Fenollosa and Pound, promotes change 
        from within by bringing forces previously held apart into interaction 
        and multiplying their cultural functions (<i>Chinese Written Character</i> 
        27).</p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>As a number of commentators have pointed out, however, the <i>and-effect</i> 
        of <i>The Cantos</i> is a squeeze play, a trap.&#160; A reader is free 
        to make recategorizations, yes, but only those determined in advance, 
        those any idiot could see, Pound says, if she looks, really looks.&#160; 
        Like his hero Louis Agassiz, who reasoned from &#147;fact&#148; upward 
        to the conclusion that &#147;[s]exual intercourse between whites and blacks 
        . . . was the moral and biological equivalent of incest&#148; (Menand 
        114), Pound&#146;s recategorizations include ideas Charles Bernstein has 
        characterized as &#147;totalitarianism masking as authority, racism posing 
        as knowledge, and elitism claiming the prerogatives of culture&#148; (<i>A 
        Poetics</i> 121).&#160; For Pound, these conclusions are as natural, objective, 
        and scientific as &#147;redness,&#148; as monovalent and closed as &#147;rightness.&#148;&#160; 
        If we credit Pound&#146;s fulminations against readers who do not use 
        his method to reach his madness, the paratactic thought-path of <i>The 
        Cantos</i> is no less constrained than the hypotactic meditations of &#147;September 
        1, 1939.&#148;&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>It is tempting to argue that the apparent freedom of Pound&#146;s 
        method is invalidated by the poverty of his ideals, but in the end the 
        method of <i>The Cantos</i> is more powerful and enduring than its application.&#160; 
        As Franco Moretti has emphasized in a similar context, literary evolution, 
        like Marxism, necessitates internal discontinuities, uneven developments.&#160; 
        To the extent that Pound&#146;s method cuts against conventional mentation 
        by requiring a reader to think otherwise, the <i>and-effect</i> is an 
        advance.&#160; &#147;Progress coexists with backwardness, indeed depends 
        on it,&#148; Moretti writes.&#160; &#147;One level of the work can be 
        bold, <i>because</i> the other is crude and superfluous.&#160; It is a 
        constructional split that runs through almost the entire twentieth century&#148; 
        (119). </p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>Pound&#146;s source-text, <i>The Chinese Written Character as a 
        Medium for Poetry,</i> is, like <i>The Cantos</i>, an epistemological 
        treatise.&#160; By investigating alternative ways of knowing, Fenollosa&#146;s 
        aim was to teach Westerners to outsmart the conventions of their own logic.&#160; 
        In Fenollosa&#146;s elaborate explanatory metaphor, Western thought consists 
        of word-bricks&#151;&#147;little hard units or concepts&#148;&#151;piled 
        in rows according to function then stuck together into &#147;a sort of 
        wall called a sentence by the use either of white mortar for the positive 
        copula &#145;is,&#146; or of black mortar for the negative copula &#145;is 
        not.&#146;&#160; In this way,&#148; Fenellosa concludes, &#147;we produce 
        such admirable propositions as &#145;A ring-tailed baboon is not a constitutional 
        assembly&#148; (26).&#160; Putting aside for a moment the lovely irony 
        that for Pound and Scalapino assemblies of any sort consist exactly of 
        ring-tailed baboons, I want to segue from Pound&#146;s <i>and-effect</i> 
        to Scalapino&#146;s <i>as-effect</i> through one of Fenollosa&#146;s examples 
        of an ideogrammic way of knowing.</p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>To illustrate his claim that &#147;[i]n reading Chinese we do not 
        seem to be juggling mental counters, but to be watching <i>things</i> 
        work out their own fate&#148; (9), Fenollosa gives the example of the 
        ideogram for <i>ripple, </i>which is a superimposition of the characters 
        for <i>boat</i> and <i>water</i>:&#160; Noun, verb, adjective, adverb, 
        and preposition, &#147;boat-water&#148; is at once a thing, an event, 
        and a relation: a confluence, an ongoingness, a transference of power, 
        a destabilization which undulates outward in all directions.&#160; This 
        ideogram is not an <i>and-effect</i>&#151;boat <i>and</i> water&#151;because 
        the concept <i>ripple</i> does not hold <i>boat</i> and <i>water</i> apart 
        but rather fuses&#151;or confuses&#151;them.&#160; Boat, water, and ripple 
        come into existence together: each component generates and sustains the 
        idea of the others.&#160; Boat-water is a gradual diffusion&#151;a ripple&#151;which 
        outraces identity or sameness.&#160; In this ideogram, &#147;[t]he difference,&#148; 
        as Gertrude Stein famously put it, &#147;is spreading&#148; (9).&#160; 
      </p>

        </span>Leslie Scalapino&#146;s play &#147;As:&#160; All Occurrence in 
        Structure Unseen&#151;(Deer Night)&#148; is a rewriting of <i>The Tempest</i> 
        without Shakespeare&#146;s plot, characters, language, or setting.&#160; 
        Composed during a trip to Thailand and Bhutan, it is an integral part 
        of a collection of prose and poetry to which Scalapino has given the title 
        <i>The Public World / Syntactically Impermanence</i>.&#160; Like <i>The 
        Cantos</i>, this book is history and dream, narrative, mythology, and 
        literary criticism, polemic and investigation, but I will consider it 
        here primarily as epistemology and syntactics.&#160; &#147;Poetry in this 
        time and nation,&#148; Scalapino says in &#147;The Cannon,&#148; one of 
        the book&#146;s opening essays, &#147;is doing the work of philosophy&#151;it 
        is writing that is conjecture&#148; (19).&#160; Unlike Auden&#146;s hypotaxis 
        and Pound&#146;s parataxis, Scalapino&#146;s syntaxis&#151;if I can call 
        it that&#151;is predicated on enduring uncertainties.&#160; Conjecture&#151;the 
        throwing together that is &#147;syntactically impermanence&#148;&#151;is, 
        by definition, the attempt to reach a conclusion or judgment on the basis 
        of uncertain evidence.&#160; As Lyn Hejinian argues in a parallel statement 
        about her own poem &#147;Happily,&#148; &#147;it is <i>as</i> philosophy--<i>as</i> 
        the making and seeing of connections . . . &#151;that poetry participates 
        in knowing what we can and can&#146;t know about the world and how to 
        live in it&#148; (384; my italics).</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>When I say I want to consider Scalapino&#146;s book &#147;as philosophy,&#148; 
        I mean <i>in the guise of</i> philosophy, but I also mean, more precisely, 
        as &#147;<i>as</i>-philosophy.&#148;&#160; The most ambitious segment 
        of <i>The Public World / Syntactically Impermanence</i> is the play-cycle 
        <i>As</i>, which develops through an impermanence syntax&#151;a hypothetical 
        rolling syntax&#151;which Hejinian terms the &#147;as-effect.&#148;&#160; 
        Hejinian explains this effect through an extended analogy with the instrumental 
        case in Russian grammar, which allows one to say not just &#147;she sings 
        like a nightingale&#148; but &#147;she sings <b>as</b> a nightingale&#151;in 
        singing, she becomes a nightingale,&#148; or, in another example, not 
        just &#147;one walks along the shore,&#148; but &#147;in walking along 
        the shore one is that shore.&#148;&#160; &#147;What I am calling the as 
        effect,&#148; Hejinian concludes, &#147;is not a trope but an &#145;occurrence 
        structure&#146;&#148; (5).&#160; It is not additive&#151;I <i>and</i> 
        the nightingale or I <i>and</i> the shore&#151;but mutually transformative: 
        I <i>as</i> the shore, the shore <i>as</i> I.&#160; The as-effect is, 
        in short, an event-in-time between two states: an energy transfer, a thought-ripple.&#160; 
      </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>The subtitle of the play&#151;&#147;All Occurrence in Structure, 
        Unseen (Deer Night)&#148;&#151;names what remains when one abandons the 
        plot, characters, setting, and language of Shakespeare&#146;s <i>Tempest</i> 
        without abandoning an intent to comment on it / demonstrate against it.&#160; 
        As a relationship hinged on <i>as</i>, the play (of) <i>As</i> is a manner 
        of knowing: <i>as if</i>, the play enumerates, <i>at the same time as,</i> 
        <i>as allowing difference</i> (97), <i>as it happens</i> (116), <i>as 
        such</i> (117).&#160; All of these states of experience depend on free 
        movement among events and ideas; all acknowledge uncertainty and contingency; 
        all erode the borders between things and beings.&#160; <i>As</i>&#151;in 
        short&#151;disables the hierarchy, rigidity, and covetousness which, for 
        Scalapino as for many postcolonial scholars, makes Shakespeare&#146;s<i> 
        Tempest</i> a marker text of imperialism and colonialism.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        </span>Like Pound&#146;s <i>and-effect</i>, Scalapino&#146;s <i>as-effect</i> 
        requires nimble cognition.&#160; &#147;I was interested,&#148; Scalapino 
        writes, &#147;in a syntax whose very mode of observation was to reveal 
        its structure; that is, its subject and its mode are subjectivity being 
        observation&#148; (&#147;Cannon&#148; 26).&#160; The reader of <i>As</i> 
        must not only think but also&#151;and at the same time&#151;think about 
        how she is thinking.&#160; This doubleness has the split of the <i>and-effect</i>&#151;one 
        must consider, at the same moment, multinational corporations, migrants 
        crossing a desert, workers burning tar at dawn, and a girl of fourteen 
        sold into slavery in a brothel&#151;and the twist or gyration of the <i>as-effect</i>.&#160; 
        The exterior subject of the girl in the brothel, for example, spins inward 
        as an interior effect in the memory of a fourteen-year old girl returning 
        from Asia to the U.S.&#160; &#147;The syntax itself,&#148; Scalapino explains, 
        &#147;reorients one&#146;s apprehension (by continual dis-location) and 
        enables that which is exterior to be included in a process of its examination, 
        necessarily self-examination&#148; (&#147;Cannon&#148; 26).&#160; In <i>As</i>, 
        no one thing is central, solo, or still.&#160; Moving against fascism 
        and fundamentalism, <i>As</i> generates a system of multiple truths, lightly 
        held, syntactically impermanence.&#160; Its concepts are at once deconstructive 
        and pragmatic. </p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'>Pound and Scalapino ask a lot&#151;some might 
        say too much&#151;of their readers.&#160; As we have seen so starkly in 
        this last month, however, an atrocity like the destruction of the twin 
        towers both emerges from and eventuates in a thinking that asks too little 
        of its cognizers.&#160; In the politics of simplicity, fundamentalism 
        begets oppositional fundamentalism; crusades, crusades.&#160; The discourse 
        is no more complicated than the swapping of pronouns in the interchange 
        &#147;I&#146;m good, you&#146;re evil&#148; / &#147;No, no, <i>I&#146;m</i> 
        good, <i>you&#146;re</i> evil.&#148;&#160; The gap created by <i>and</i> 
        and the twist created by <i>as</i> trouble the categorizations of the 
        public world.&#160; In a time of uneven developments, mutual complicity, 
        and contingent suffering, a poetics of difficulty opens the thinking differently 
        which also constitutes a politics of difficulty.&#160; &#147;In the political 
        sense,&#148; as Harryette Mullen said in phrasing that generated the topic 
        in this panel, &#147;we think of theory <i>as</i> not existing for its 
        own sake but <i>as</i> a way of thinking toward action <i>and</i> how 
        we actually exist in the world after we&#146;ve thought about things.&#160; 
        Thinking should change that&#148; (Bedient 661).&#160; </p>
