      <p align="center"><b>Anita Helle</b></p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'>In our linked essays on the status of gender 
        as a critical category in modernism, Mary DeShazer and I are interested 
        in the question, &#147;What new ground needs to be broken, what new questions 
        explored?&#148;&#160; We bring a particular interest in the relation of 
        modernism&#146;s aesthetic traditions to rhetorics of emancipation across 
        national boundaries, including but not limited to and interest in feminist 
        rhetorics and their sociopoetic implications.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Critical overviews of gender and modernism have 
        acknowledged the substantial legacies of gynocriticism (enlarging the 
        canon of female modernists) and gynesis (the feminine as metaphor of historical 
        process and/or reading effect in texts by men and women).&#160;&#160; 
        Marianne DeKoven&#146;s deconstructive analysis of gender as the <i>sous-rature</i><i> 
        </i>of high modernism predicts that as we learn more about the &#147;variegated 
        manifestations&#148; of gender and modernism, gender may appear as an 
        &#147;unsynthesized&#148; dialectic&#148; that seeks neither unity or 
        resolution (<i>The Cambridge Companion to Modernism</i>, 192).&#160; A 
        transnational feminist focus on women and gender has sometimes been defined 
        as a concentration on socio-political contingencies of women&#146;s modernity, 
        as distinguished from literary modernism, which focuses on the cultural 
        aspects (Lowe and Lloyd).&#160; But such separations are too rigid for 
        the study of modernism and gender in transnational locations, and may 
        contribute to discursive hardening.&#160; We find that when questions 
        of gender and modernism migrate across national boundaries, they reveal 
        differences in the time-levels of modernity, in the socio-economic-political 
        conditions, and different constructions of the category of the aesthetic, 
        all of which need to be taken into account.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Rita Felski&#146;s historicist and interdisciplinary 
        approach to the criss-crossing of the aesthetic and the political in <i>The 
        Gender of Modernity</i> (1995) and <i>Doing Time </i>(2000) is exemplary 
        of a supple and flexible attitude toward &#147;locational&#148; constructions 
        of gender and modernity.&#160; For something <i>has </i>happened to enlarge 
        the discursive and material categories in which gender appears since &#147;around 
        1990,&#148; when Bonnie Kime Scott&#146;s introduction to a &#147;new 
        scope of gender and modernism&#148; included &#147;cultural critiques&#148; 
        as only one among a long list of gendered modernism&#146;s many dimensions 
        (14-15).&#160; By Felski&#146;s account, the cultural meanings of modernity<a
href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a> 
        have enlarged to include all of the following: 1) an unfinished revolution 
        around the rhetoric of liberty and self-expression; 2) debates about the 
        gendered public sphere and avant-garde institutions; 3) debates about 
        gender within modernism&#146;s global reach; 4) documents, reports, manifestos, 
        and literary expressions articulating a&#160; gendered basis for the &#147;experience 
        of modernity&#148; (see also Clark 1991; Appadurai 1996;&#160; Lyon 1999).&#160; 
        As cultural meanings of modernity have become more prismatic, gender has 
        become more refractive of these differential debates.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>2</span></a> The starting question Felski would have 
        us ask thus takes the &#147;cultural&#148; as a primary term: &#147;How 
        do established approaches to gender and modernism fall short of women&#146;s 
        participation in the varied cultures of modernity?&#148;&#160;&#160; In 
        1990, Bonnie Kime Scott&#146;s publication of <i>Gender and Modernism, 
        </i>at the time an important synthesis,<i> </i>appears retrospectively 
        to have marked the <i>emergence </i>of questions (with the historical 
        weight that &#147;emergence&#148; implies), amidst a <i>wide matrix of 
        influences</i> and ever-expanding questioning of cultural location.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a> Our genealogical maps of this emergence 
        would insistently include gender as a critical category in conjunctures 
        of gender and genre, as well as gender and race relations; they include 
        local/global cross-cultural encounters that have been especially significant 
        for analyzing non-elite subjects and genres despised by modernism (genres&#160; 
        such as elegy, autobiography, political orature); they may include the 
        splicings of public and private in traumas of dislocation&#160; and catastrophes 
        of migration. </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>I have been working on a project that concerns 
        problems in the containment of representation for gender and genre relations, 
        specifically in modern American poetry&#146;s gendered constructions of 
        elegy.&#160; The dynamics of genre and gender containment participate 
        in the ironies of modernism&#146;s &#147;making new&#148; and within a 
        variety of claims about modern American poetry&#146;s claims to status 
        in a new global field.&#160;&#160; Susan Stewart has theorized the way 
        cultural processes of&#160; &#147;distressing&#148; genres&#151;rescuing, 
        refurbishing, or antiquing old genres&#151;is one way that modernity renders 
        strangeness familiar, recreating the desire for speaking objects as touchstones&#160; 
        of public memory and&#160; self-reference&#160; (66-67).&#160;&#160; The 
        heroic, monumental modernism of figures such as Pound, and later Olson, 
        is well known to have globalized an aesthetic of loss and recovery, promoting 
        the disappearance and reappearance of a past as an archive of modern memory.&#160; 
        Through such processes&#151;of reading backward into generic histories, 
        and re-gendering their traditions&#151;the idea of what counts as losses 
        worth mourning in poetry and the styles appropriate to modern lament&#160; 
        (whether openly emotive or rigorously analytical) sometimes becomes more 
        narrowly archived.&#160;&#160; Hence elegy is declared &#147;over&#148; 
        for modernism with Pound&#146;s warning about the dangerous &#147;precipice 
        of lamentation,&#148; and yet elegy continues to leave its distressed 
        imprint on American lyric poetry well into mid-century, with the proliferation 
        of family elegy in the confessional lyric.<a href="#_edn4"
name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>4</span></a>&#160;&#160; 
        Yet from the perspective of a the varied cultures of female modernity 
        that Felski asks us to acknowledge, the modern elegiac tradition is clearly 
        a broader one, including the language of public and civic rhetoric as 
        well as the writing of disaster around historical trauma, genocide, forced 
        migration or mass epidemics (AIDS elegy being only the most obvious recent 
        example the problem of containment and resignifying of gender and genre).&#160; 
        The globalization of modernist aesthetics, with its neo-romantic fascination 
        with loss, nostalgia, and remembered-forgetting, appears from a transnational 
        feminist perspective less an erasure of the past, a melancholic mourning 
        (in the sense of a Kristevan semiotic), than an encryptment of uncomfortable 
        narratives about cultural violence.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>The complex poetic testimonies of American modernist 
        Muriel Rukeyser (and her frequent, lavish invocation of&#160; elegy) serve 
        as an example of the phenomenon&#160; of &#147;distressing&#148; genres 
        and reworking historically uncomfortable gendered associations.&#160;&#160; 
        Rukeyser&#146;s &#147;The Dam&#148; (one of the few formally experimental 
        poems by female modernists anthologized in the Pierre Joris and Jerome 
        Rothenberg 1995 anthology of international modernism, <i>Poems for the 
        Millennium</i>)<i> </i>recognizes America as the symbol of modernity&#146;s 
        dream of globalized power; her poem, &#147;The Book of the Dead&#148; 
        renders America&#146;s determined blindness to class and race relations 
        as a type of historical forgetting.&#160; The representations of silicon 
        dust, exposure to which resulted in the deaths of working class and black 
        migrant laborers in the largest industrial disaster of the twentieth century 
        at that time, allow contradictory readings.&#160; Lethal yet illuminating&#151;a 
        shining, permeating white substance&#151;dust covers the North American 
        landscape and penetrates its dreams.&#160; Recently critics have suggested 
        that Rukeyser&#146;s frequent use of a&#160;&#160; dialogic structure 
        foregrounding local differences in representing roads, bridges, dams, 
        and other symbols of America&#146;s modernity also works to counteract 
        nationalistic discourses that gloss such differences&#160; (Lowney 196).&#160; 
        Rukeyser insists on resignifying the rhetorical as well as poetic traditions 
        of civic elegy, from a narrow focus on individuated and nationalistic 
        losses, to a poetic mourning bowed by the weight of the collective.&#160;&#160; 
        In a later poem about the rise of fascism between world wars, &#147;Kathe 
        Kollwitz,&#148; she conjures the threat of&#160; historical again trauma 
        by joining an image of global&#160; production (borrowing also the imagery 
        of Kollwitz&#146;s <i>Lamentation</i>) with the image of modern death&#151;the&#160; 
        &#147;big hands of the world&#160; of death.&#148;&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Yet for all her commitment to working through 
        the relationship between ideology and linguistic expression, Rukeyser&#146;s 
        reception among modernist contemporaries on the left and the right is 
        also gendered.&#160; For some of the same reasons that she is not always 
        seen as formally experimental, her insistence on blending mourning with 
        outrage was misrecognized.&#160; At the <i>Partisan Review, </i>her poems 
        written to mourn and commemorate deaths of marines and civilian volunteers 
        who defended Wake Island in the Pacific during World War II earned her 
        the disparaging label &#147;poster girl of Wake Island,&#148; transforming 
        her reputation from serious poet to political bunny among left-wing intellectuals 
        (Brock 258).&#160; The reasons for their disparagement are complex: the 
        poems include a high-flown rhetoric of political orature with a patient 
        eye for documentary methods and refusal to keep emotion under wraps.&#160; 
        Rukeyser&#146;s poetic is conscious of coloring, not only emotional coloring 
        in the traditional impressionistic sense, but the relation of emotional 
        coloring to the role of racialized histories of violence&#160;&#160;&#160; 
        Her dreams of poetry&#146;s emotional power and modernity&#146;s encrypted 
        violence is such that it requires active struggle with such a range and 
        variety of genres as to indicate forms &#147;forever broken and remade.&#148; 
      </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>As we consider the varied cultures of female 
        modernity in relation to modernism&#146;s gendered literary practices, 
        it may be important, as Susan Friedman (1998) has argued,&#160; that&#160; 
        transnational feminist practice apply the lessons of situational and relational 
        criticism to the politics of knowledge and the act of criticism itself.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>6</span></a>&#160; 
        This entails exploring reflexively an ethics and a politics of style in 
        critical writing, as well as interpretative method.&#160; Friedman urges 
        that significant components of an ethics and a politics of style includes 
        recognition of varied audiences for investigations of gendered modernism 
        across national boundaries.&#160; Such inquiry may call into question 
        the status of textuality itself across these boundaries; it can and should 
        raise questions about what voices might be involved or included within 
        the telling and retelling of cultural narratives that fill in the gendered 
        gaps (Friedman 33-35).&#160; What recently emerges from attention to such 
        risks is also a heightened geopolitical sensitivity to the questions that 
        may be especially invoked by space or place, as well as the differences 
        between the enounced and the subject of the enunciation.&#160; For instance, 
        in our collaborative writing Mary DeShazer and I evoke a familiar gynocritical 
        trope of collaboration.&#160; However, in constructing &#147;linked papers,&#148; 
        together yet separate, our intention is not to fuse homogeneous perspectives 
        at a singular horizon, but to suggest several variations on the theme 
        of what happens when questions of gendered modernism migrate across national 
        boundaries, opening a space for dialogue and differences. </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Opportunities to historicize critical practices 
        of reading gender and modernism also remind us that if we expect to get 
        beyond either-or stalemates (those that may divide perspectives developed 
        from within literary criticism, for example, from those perspectives which 
        develop from within a women&#146;s studies focus on transnational identities), 
        we need to understand how to make interrelated reading strategies, tropes, 
        assumptions of &#147;reading on the move&#148; more visible.&#160; For 
        starters, as Friedman argues, we may want to pinpoint how aspects of gynetics 
        and gynocriticism (themselves cultural constructs) already have and continue 
        to be mutually interwoven, enlarged, qualified, and extended in transnational 
        contexts.&#160;&#160; Such critical practices may invoke a kind of focused 
        wandering, even a pleasure in the theoretical awkwardness of asymmetry 
        and disjunction.<a href="#_edn7"
name="_ednref7" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>7</span></a>&#160;&#160; 
        Here are a few of the critical practices and assumptions that may be especially 
        productive as the status of gender as a critical category in modernism 
        continues to challenge fixed boundaries:</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><b>1. <i>The practice of refusing the modernist 
        narrative of rupture with the 19<sup>th</sup> century</i></b><i> </i> 
        This reading practice revises, amplifies, and extends the move of Bonnie 
        Kime Scott (7) and others to put modernism&#146;s temporalities &#147;under 
        erasure&#148; in an effort to expose historical exclusions of women writers 
        from canons, periodicities, and generic practices.&#160; Refusals of rupture 
        in style and periodization has productively revealed modernism&#146;s 
        deeper continuities (the continued presence of realism and melodrama, 
        for instance) and interweavings of masculine and feminine within male 
        and female-authored texts.&#160; Yet ruptures of the &#147;new&#148; and 
        social crises of representation are not simply mimetic of each other, 
        or readable as synchronous moments.&#160; Paul Gilroy is eloquent on the 
        point that the &#147;double consciousness&#148; of black modernity may 
        need to include the double consciousness of temporalities, since it absorbs, 
        from within and outside Western rhetoric, the language of enlightenment 
        rationality and democratic traditions of free expression (48).&#160; The 
        expectation that gendered expressions of black Atlanticism might necessarily 
        express a stylistic break with the canons of 19<sup>th</sup> century poetic 
        expressions then, may be as narrow as the old expectation that modern 
        blank Atlanticism, is cut off from traditions of international modernist 
        experimentation as a primary source of inspiration and ambition.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2. The 
        practice of resisting formal linguistic &#147;experimentation&#148; as 
        the privileged center of modernist creativity.</span></i></b> Related 
        to 1 (and well underway), Scott&#146;s gathering of representative modernist 
        voices at numerous points cautions against equating formal conservativism 
        with political quiescence.&#160; Notably, this is the argument made by 
        Celeste Schenck for inclusion of &#233;migr&#233; Australian poet Anna 
        Wickham, whose &#147;modernism&#148; might be evaluated through a number 
        of differential axes, and certainly by more than her relation to traditions 
        privileging linguistic experimentation.&#160; Rachel Blau DuPlessis has 
        articulated a practice of reading termed &#147;social philology,&#148; 
        which augments the challenge of modernism&#146;s &#147;deep textures&#148; 
        (26) and sociopolitical coding to reveal national mediations and intertextualities 
        of cross-racial representations.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>8</span></a>&#160; As cultures of modernity (and women&#146;s 
        place in them) become more prismatic, we may want to ask, &#147;How many 
        ways are there to experiment?&#160; Does experimentation in traditional 
        forms of civic rhetoric, where the subject involves shifts in lyric forms 
        of address, count as part of an aesthetic tradition of linguistic experimentation?&#148;&#160;

        </i>This is part of the large-scale project of reconsidering the gendering 
        of emotion in modernism, a project to which my own explorations of pathos 
        and Mary DeShazer&#146;s explorations of languages of liberation in political 
        orature contributes.&#160; Melancholia, as Nicholas Abraham and Maria 
        Torok teach us, is a term of historical structure, as well as figural 
        content.&#160; Their revisionary interpretation of the modernist tomb, 
        crypt, word within the psyche as a &#147;gaps left within us by the secrets 
        of others&#148; (171-76) and opens the way for new interpretations of 
        poetry&#146;s critical relationship to public memory.&#160; Whereas incorporation 
        and encryption may be considered in some way a failure in the psychic 
        limits of imagining and representing the losses of others in terms recognizable 
        by and including the social body, the traditional meanings of introjection 
        (&#147;healthy mourning,&#148; in the Freudian scheme), may be re-envisioned 
        as a way to describe an acceptance of processes which demand negotiation 
        and transformation of the boundaries of the isolate self and the isolated 
        nation.&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><b><i>4. The practice of locating the material 
        and discursive markers of &#147;diasporic&#148; reading.&#160;&#160; Fluidity, 
        polyphony, palimpsest, border-crossing, migration</i></b>&#151;when these 
        are deployed metaphorically&#151;can make strange bedfellows with postcolonial 
        and feminist transnational critique in an era when modernity&#146;s global 
        &#147;flows&#148; can have benign or, as&#160; we have seen, catastrophic 
        consequences.&#160; Metaphorical inflections as part of our critical vocabularies 
        can enlarge or reduce effects of power, fleshing out its manifestations 
        in the imagination of universal embodiments, or enhancing and intertwining 
        specific histories.&#160; From Euro-American perspective, as a number 
        of feminist critics interested in transnational practice have noted, such 
        tropes in academic criticism have enjoyed the privilege of association 
        with modern aestheticism and histories of cultural exoticism, often within 
        the very trajectories and locations of loss and power that interests in 
        re-theorizing and remaking gendered identities seek to redress and de-naturalize 
        (Massey 1994; Kaplan 1996).&#160; The ongoing, complex deployments of 
        gender in modernism are such that specifying whatever we will mean by 
        reading gender diasporically, &#147;on the move,&#148; and in relation 
        to global scenes of historical trauma across a long twentieth century 
        will be a task both difficult and necessary.</p>

          the term &#147;cultural&#148; are inevitably in play (and at stake) 
          in historically specific references to uses of gender within feminist 
          cultural criticism of the last decade.&#160; In a useful move, Appadurai 
          (14-15) recognizes that tension between the anthropological use of &#147;culture&#148; 
          as an adjective to describe dimensions of phenomenon, and the humanities-based&#160; 
          notions of &#147;culture&#148; with respect to aesthetic expressions 
          and movements, often universalized in its meanings,&#160; may require 
          the use of the term &#147;culturalist&#148; to refer to the rhetoric 
          of groups &#147;consciously in the making.&#148;&#160; Appadurai&#146;s 
          proposal for a distinct use of &#147;culturalist&#148; is logically 
          intertwined with feminist cultural history&#146;s interest in &#147;rhetorics&#148; 
          as intertwined with &#147;poetics.&#148;</p>

          parallel developments in the treatment of gender as a critical category 
          in modernism and gender as critical category in feminist political theory.&#160; 
          An axis of sameness/difference opened onto more fluid and shifting conceptions,&#160; 
          as &#147;alterities&#148; shifting with social structure and geopolitical

          category in cultural theory can be figured as the emergence of a matrix

          The use of gender as a critical category has not taken over the field, 
          nor have deployments of gender as a critical category (broadly considered 
          to include studies which touch on women and gender in modernism, gay/lesbian/queer 
          theory-inspired critiques, critiques of heteromasculinity, and studies 
          of performativity of gender) have ranged from 1 in 40 (in 1994) to 1 
          of 5 or 6 (in 1996 and 1997) to 1 in 8 or 9 in 2000-01.&#160; In <i>PMLA</i>,
