      <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Transnational Gendered Modernisms:&#160;Reading 
        Manifestoes, Political Poetry, and Orature by Black South African Women</font></b></p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b>Mary K. DeShazer</b></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>What happens when feminist scholars transnationalize 
        the boundaries of gendered modernisms?&#160; When we read &#147;on the 
        move,&#148; developing a diasporic consciousness that allows us to explore 
        the historical and cultural exigencies of once colonized people who have 
        documented their experiences in literary or polemical texts?&#160; How 
        might we reread gendered modernities through diasporic women&#146;s testimonies 
        of a perpetual state of living in the borderlands; their accounts of racist 
        violence, homelessness, or forced dislocation and the attendant memories 
        and traumas; their resultant multivocal identity politics and poetics 
        of resistance?&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height: 200%'>Black South African women&#146;s anti-apartheid 
        manifestoes, political poetry, and orature from the first half of the 
        twentieth century suggest new ways of examining these questions.&#160; 
        In bringing a postcolonial, diasporic lens to modernist narratives from 
        the South African national liberation struggle, I wish to extend the insights 
        of Paul Gilroy on the Black Atlantic and the &#147;chronotope&#148; of 
        ships passing from Europe to Africa and back; of Rita Felski on feminist 
        discourses of racial othering in early suffragist texts; and of Janet 
        Lyon on the significance and mutual influence of British and U.S. political 
        manifestoes of the modernist period.&#160; Such revisionist transnational 
        inquiry can contribute to what Gilroy has called a &#147;politics of transfiguration&#148; 
        that &#147;reveals the hidden internal fissures in the concept of modernity&#148; 
        (38). It also responds to the question of what critical ground gendered 
        modernisms need still to cover.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Reading as modernist texts the manifestoes against 
        racism (and sexism) by Black South African women of the African National 
        Congress (ANC) enables us to extend our understanding of feminist discourses 
        of evolution and revolution beyond the boundaries investigated so insightfully 
        by Felski and Lyon.&#160; To challenge the &#147;ideology of primitivism&#148; 
        in Olive Schreiner&#146;s <i>Women&#146;s Labour</i> (1911), in which, 
        as Felski notes, Schreiner claims that Black (&#147;Kaffir&#148;) women 
        accept their lot as submissive to men while&#160; European women protest 
        it, we might explore speeches by Charlotte Maxeke, a South African teacher 
        who joined the &#147;Women&#146;s Auxiliary&#148; of the ANC when it was 
        founded in 1912 as a &#147;national vigilant organization&#148; to assert 
        the rights of South Africa&#146;s majority Black population.&#160; Dissatisfied, 
        like many women leaders, with non-voting status in the ANC, Maxeke founded 
        the Bantu Women&#146;s League in 1918. She was inspired by the militancy 
        of 600 women in Bloemfontain, who in 1913 had successfully demonstrated 
        against the white government&#146;s efforts to require them to carry passbooks, 
        or &#147;passes,&#148; that identified them as racial others and limited 
        severely their freedom of movement.&#160; These African women identified 
        with British suffragism, as indicated by the cry of &#147;Votes for Women&#148; 
        that emerged during the demonstrations at Bloemfontain and by their wearing 
        of the blue rosettes which suffragists also favored&#160; (Wells, 21-29).&#160; 
      </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Comparing the writing of Christabel and Emmeline 
        Pankhurst about &#147;Black Friday,&#148; a day in December 1913 when 
        militant British suffragists sustained their most violent treatment at 
        the hands of the police, to the manifestoes of South African women in 
        the 1913 anti-pass protests reveals how feminist discourse across cultures 
        can offer a richly integrative field of study.&#160; The anti-pass activists, 
        like Schreiner and the Pankhursts, rely on the rhetorical strategies of 
        repetition, abstraction, hyperbole, and prophecy in their speeches and 
        treatises. Typically they speak as a unitary &#147;we,&#148; reveal a 
        teleology that posits good vs. evil, and offer a spirited ethical critique 
        of their oppressors (&#147;men&#148; for the suffragists, &#147;white 
        men&#148; for the South African women).&#160; These South African documents 
        present Black women activists, in Felski&#146;s words, as &#147;subjects 
        of social processes rather than mere bystanders&#148; (168).&#160; As 
        she notes in <i>Doing Time</i>, reconceptualizing modernity does not erase 
        differences but undoes and redoes them in complex ways (62).&#160; Other 
        documents by Black anti-apartheid women activists bear scrutiny as well, 
        most notably the resolution on women&#146;s resistance drafted by female 
        ANC delegates to the All African Convention of 1935; the new ANC constitution 
        of 1943, drafted by men and women together, which gave women full voting 
        rights within the organization; and the 1955 Freedom Charter and its attendant 
        list of demands, drafted by the newly formed Federation of South African 
        Women (see Kimble and Unterhalter, 1-10).&#160; Also worth examining is 
        the rhetoric of the second women&#146;s anti-pass march of 1956, when 
        20,000 women stormed the government halls in Pretoria, chanting the now-famous 
        slogan,</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          You have tampered with the women;<br>
          You have struck a rock.<br>
          You have dislodged a boulder;<br>
          You will be crushed (DeShazer, 133). 
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Although few Black South African women published 
        poetry during the modernist period, and virtually none in English, poets 
        since the 1960s have written imaginatively from the perspective of their 
        mothers and grandmothers.&#160; An especially salient motif has been the 
        plight and protests of domestic workers, arguably the most exploited of 
        South Africa&#146;s female laborers (Thula Baba, 324).&#160; Looking intertextually 
        at domestic worker poetry by African American women of the Harlem Renaissance 
        and poetry by South African women that documents the 1940s and 50s can 
        yield fruitful insights into what Rachel DuPlessis terms &#147;social 
        philology,&#148; a method of close reading that attends to &#147;the events 
        of the form&#148; and the ideological assumptions and cultural narratives 
        that undergird them (5). </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>&#160;For example, we might compare the language 
        and imagery of Anne Spencer&#146;s tribute to a Black American washerwoman, 
        &#147;Lady, Lady&#148; (1925), to those of Boitumelo Mofokeng&#146;s &#147;Inside 
        a Domestic Worker&#148; (1950).&#160; Addressing the domestic worker with 
        empathy, Spencer uses the woman&#146;s hands as a synecdoche for her exploited 
        labor:</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          Lady, Lady, I saw your hands,<br>
          Twisted, awry, like crumpled roots,<br>
          Bleached poor white in a sudsy tub,<br>
          Wrinkled and drawn from your rub-a-dub. 
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Ironically, the Lady&#146;s hands emerge &#147;poor 
        white&#148; from the washtub, as bleached and &#147;twisted&#148; as the 
        minds of her oppressors.&#160; Mofokeng also employs hand imagery in her 
        poem; however, she speaks not to a domestic worker but in her voice, and 
        she portrays the worker&#146;s hands as a tool of salvation:</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          If I don&#146;t know arithmetic<br>
          My hands will save me.<br>
          I can work in the kitchens.<br>
          My back can be a rocking horse<br>
          For kleinbassie. (the boss&#146;s son)<br>
          Restig, Missus soek vir hardwerkers. (Be assured, the Missus is determined 
          to find hard workers). 
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Using Afrikaans, the official language of apartheid, 
        Mofokeng&#146;s domestic worker both acknowledges and resists her status 
        as beast of burden.&#160; Although she recognizes the indignity of her 
        body as a toy that the master&#146;s young son can manipulate, she confronts 
        the &#147;Missus&#148; on her own terms and in the oppressor&#146;s language.&#160; 
        By validating the domestic worker&#146;s subjectivity, both Spencer and 
        Mofokeng contribute to the feminist project of breaking silence about 
        Black women&#146;s exploitation.&#160; However, through her use of colloquial 
        free verse rather than quatrains of iambic tetrameter, and through her 
        code-switching from English to Afrikaans, Mofokeng inscribes a subversive 
        text.&#160; She presents her domestic worker not as a victim but as a 
        survivor.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>The poetic form most fully embraced by rural 
        Zulu women is that of <i>izibongo</i>, or praise poems.&#160; Although 
        <i>izibongo</i> have for centuries been associated with war and male authority, 
        and <i>izimbongi</i> (bards) who recite on public occasions have generally 
        been men, women too have composed and performed praise poems in private 
        circle ceremonies, as a means of exploring issues of daily life, personal 
        identity, and domestic conflict.&#160; The scholar and oral historian 
        Elizabeth Gunner, who collected and translated women&#146;s <i>izibongo</i> 
        from KwaZulu/Natal during the 1960s and 70s, argues that such poetry constitutes 
        &#147;an effective and socially acceptable way of publicly announcing 
        one&#146;s anger or grief&#148;(240).&#160; Moreover, through their private 
        nature via &#147;in-house only&#148; performances (no men or female outsiders 
        are allowed), and through their use of an indigenous language, <i>izibongo</i> 
        have resisted appropriation by the forces of apartheid, which from 1948 
        to 1994 attempted, through forced relocations and inferior educational 
        opportunity, to rob South Africa&#146;s Black people of their cultural 
        heritage and distinction.&#160; Proponents of apartheid devalued or ignored 
        orature, just as they marginalized the people who create it, yet orature 
        has thrived for generations across African cultures and languages.&#160; 
        Praise poetry might thus be usefully compared to those poetic forms that 
        Cheryl Wall has called &#147;the building blocks of African-American modernism&#148;: 
        folk speech, spirituals, gospel, jazz, and blues (1).&#160; </p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Specifically, Zulu women&#146;s praise poems 
        can be read alongside the blues songs of Bessie Smith, &#147;Ma&#148; 
        Rainey, or Billie Holliday and the &#147;bad&#148; ballads of Margaret 
        Walker, known for their powerful blend of outrage and lament, their sexual 
        explicitness, and their representations of women&#146;s anger at male 
        exploiters and female rivals. Take, for example, the praise poem of Silomo 
        of the Mdlalose clan, composed early in the twentieth century for her 
        daughter, Princess Magogo, and translated by Gunner.&#160; Its primary 
        stylistic characteristics are indirection and private allusion, its major 
        motif is confessional, and its composition appears to be singular rather 
        than collaborative.&#160; ( <i>Izibongo</i> often are composed collectively 
        by members of the audience, but this poem is attributed to one woman rather 
        than a group of women from a certain tribe).&#160; Initially addressing 
        her daughter as &#147;sensitive one,&#148; Silomo vents her hostility 
        toward an unnamed other woman, probably a co-wife; reveals that woman&#146;s 
        aggression toward Silomo, which motivates the speaker&#146;s anger; and 
        relies on explicit references to female sexuality and embodiment:</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          Sensitive one, easily moved,<br>
          I wonder if the deceitful creature over there hears my words?<br>
          The broad-lipped woman pursued unmercifully, the one with labia like 
          a puffed adder? 
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Lines 4-9 catalog a series of insults the speaker 
        has suffered at the hands of this broad-lipped woman, who &#147;turned 
        in disdain from me.&#148;&#160; The reason for this scorn, and the reason 
        for the poem, is probably the birth of the speaker&#146;s regal child:&#160; 
        &#147;I have become the great mother of the royal line.&#148;&#160; In 
        the last five lines, addressing her competitor directly, the speaker offers 
        a humorous, dismissive invective:</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          And what could you say to me? You with a twig for offspring,<br>
          With your lop-sided head.<br>
          You&#146;re like this and I will insult you like this:<br>
          You&#146;re like the shrivelled-up buttocks of my brother-in-law;<br>
          You&#146;re like the shrivelled-up buttocks of Zinyo (Gunner, 250). 
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>This <i>izibongo</i> might be usefully compared 
        to Margaret Walker&#146;s &#147;Molly Means&#148; as the type of poem 
        that Countee Cullen, speaking pejoratively of the jazz poetry of Langston 
        Hughes, called an &#147;interloper&#148; (DuPlessis, 108).&#160; Walker&#146;s 
        speaker, like Silomo, plays the dozens, insulting Molly as a &#147;witch,&#148; 
        &#147;hag,&#148; and &#147;chile of the devil&#148;; she too portrays 
        her adversary in derogatory, sexualized terms&#151;&#147;barking like 
        a dog/And on all fours like a common hog&#148;. Gendered remappings and 
        rich textual hybridities emerge through such migratory readings.</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>In 1984 Adrienne Rich challenged U.S. feminists 
        to consider Black South African women&#146;s discourses of resistance 
        as crucial texts for global feminist theory: </p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>When I learn that in 1913, mass women&#146;s marches were held 
        in South Africa which caused the rescinding of entry permit laws; that... 
        African women have played a major role alongside men in resisting apartheid, 
        I have to ask myself why it took me so long to learn these chapters of 
        women&#146;s history, why the leadership and strategies of African women 
        have been so unrecognized as theory in action by white Western feminist 
        thought (231).</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>Why indeed?&#160; I join Rich in urging that 
        further critical attention be given to these exemplary South African texts 
        and contexts.&#160; Yet in doing so I wish not to privilege the discourses 
        of one nation&#146;s women over those produced by other postcolonial and 
        gender-focused writers and activists.&#160; A vital concern that events 
        following September 11 have reawakened for Western academic women, it 
        seems to me, is how best to support dialogue across cultural differences 
        and thus foster solidarity among women seeking self-determination.&#160; 
        As U.S. playwright and activist Eve Ensler noted at the Dec. 2001 Brussels 
        Conference on Women in Afghanistan, to women struggling against misogyny 
        and for survival and empowerment, &#147;Afghanistan is Everywhere&#148; 
        (Austin, 14).&#160; So, I would argue, is South Africa.&#160; From Charlotte 
        Maxeke and the women of the ANC to domestic worker poets like Boitumelo 
        Mofokeng and Zulu praise poets like Silomo, South African women have created 
        political art that matters and transformed political matters into art.&#160;&#160; 
        If we want to transnationalize gendered modernisms, feminist scholars 
        must hear their voices. </p>
