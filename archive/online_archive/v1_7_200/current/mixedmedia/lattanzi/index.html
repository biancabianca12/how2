      <p>(based on a scene from the 1922 film,<b> <i>Nosferatu</i>, by F.W.&nbsp;Murnau</b>,

      <p>This is a work of low-bandwidth cinema. </p>
      <p>This means that the download process (approximately 10 min. with a 54k 
        modem) is part of the experience of the work. During download, 3.2mb of 
        text, images, and sound gradually will coalesce on your screen.</p>
      <p>Interaction: There is only one main screen. <i>How</i> as well as <i>where</i> 
        you move the cursor affects the images and the soundtrack. (Clicking the 
        mouse button does nothing.)</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Your interaction orchestrates image and sound. An algorithm, similar 
          to a random coin toss, controls the text by determining whether the 
          sequence of words progresses forward or backwards. A minute or two later, 
          sound will be heard. If your cursor is over black, then the sound plays 
          forward. If your cursor is over white, then the sound plays backwards. 
          As images begin to display on screen, they will change depending upon 
          cursor movement or stasis, as well as the cursor's relative positioning 
          on the screen. Eventually over 250 images of tiny file size will download 
          to your computer. Images of horses will appear as the final quarter 
          of the movie begins to display on your screen.</p>

      <p><b>A statement in the form of 8 points.</b></p>
      <p>1.Jonathon has 2 bites. He found them on his neck this morning. </p>
      <p>These wounds attract a fly excited to either feed on the wound-pus or 
        to use the wounds to lay its eggs. </p>
      <p>2.Earlier, in the original film <i>Nosferatu</i>, a particular flower 
        is called the &quot;vampire of the vegetable world&quot;. It makes itself 
        into a wound to trap a fly. Its "woundedness" is the expression of its 
        potent agency. </p>
      <p>More pathetically, Jonathon has now become a wound to the fly. </p>
      <p>3.The fly reads the 2 bites as a sign - awakening an insect desire. The 
        fly attempts to impregnate Jonathan as its carrier, an egg-carrying agent 
        on its behalf. </p>
      <p>4.Yet Jonathon's own expressions of desire, of bitter bitten wounded 
        need, in a letter he is writing to Mina, makes him entirely sympathetic 
        to us. </p>
      <blockquote> <i>Mina, my beloved, don't be unhappy. Though I am far away, 
        I love you. This is a strange country, amazing...</i></blockquote>
      <p>We just cannot believe that he is becoming <i>fundamentally</i> a wound, 
        an impossibility: the medium of a fly or a vampire. This is hard to watch.</p>
      <p>5. Jonathon whisks the fly away with the letter that he is writing. Horses 
        flee in terror.</p>
      <p>6. An interface is a medium and a structured absence animated over time. 
        The most mundane avatar is my cursor on the screen - a simulacrum of the 
        inter-actor. My symbolic representation both "knows me" and is able to 
        substitute its own agency for mine, while giving me a stage onto which 
        I "perform" causality and Will as strange or curious artifice. </p>
      <p>7.My cursor puppet moves toward the representational image like a fly 
        to a wound. I &quot;move&quot; the cursor and the representation responds. 
        The representation becomes the carrier of my desire... or is that the 
        desire of the machine?</p>
      <p>8. The interface is the structured absence that knows me. My own projection 
        onto it pipes the colloidal ooze into which I sink my eggs. It breathes 
        its automaton being, almost it seems, on my behalf. As inter-actor, I 
        vampirize the representation which vampirizes me. </p>

      <p>Bio: </p>
      <p>Barbara Lattanzi is currently Visiting Artist in Digital Media at Smith 
        College, Northampton, Massachusetts. Recent exhibitions of her work include 
        the screening of several early films as part of the 1999-2000 Museum of 
        Modern Art series "Big As Life: An American History of 8mm Films" and 
        the on-line exhibition of digital multimedia work as part of the Rhizome 
        "Artbase" collection of net art. Lattanzi's ongoing collection of interactive 
        multimedia applets, "wildernessPuppets" was included in the 9th New York 
        Digital Salon. She presented "Muscle and Blood Piano", experimental software 
        for live performance, at the Wisconsin Film Festival and at the "Ready
