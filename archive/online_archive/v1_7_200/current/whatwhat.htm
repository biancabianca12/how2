<P CLASS="REDHEADER">reading/s</P>

<P>Extended writings on/into the ouvre of a particular woman  poet-- contemporary or modernist--whose line of investigation in the poem  and/or in a written poetics, has pursued questions of innovation or linguistic  and syntactic invention as differentiated from a mainstream or traditional  perspective. The investigation of the poetics/politics of intentionality  may be considered as a significant element of this section, as well as questions  of canon-formation, public access, the reviewing process, etc. These writings  may be original or reprinted (by permission); presented in whole or partially  excerpted. Personal reflections on the poem-making process are also encouraged,  as well as more formal essays. A revolving guest editor will invite contributions  and select from proposals for each succeeding issue. The guest editor for  the next issue to be announced shortly. [See "<A HREF="../announce.htm">how  to</A>" for guidelines to "Proposal of Texts" and "Manuscript Formating."] </P>

<P CLASS="REDHEADER">new writing . o O</P>

<P>While poems--in their hybrid natures--remain the primary focus in HOW2,  we are also interested in non-traditional, blurred genre forms that include  visual, narrative and dramatic elements of fiction and dialogue. Each contribution  in this section must include a "Working Note," briefly describing the writing  process or the project attempted, plus a short bio/biblio note including  recent publication, if any. A revolving guest editor will invite contributions  and select from proposals for each succeeding issue. The guest editor for  the next issue to be announced shortly. [See "<A HREF="../announce.htm">how  to</A>" for guidelines to "Proposal of Texts" and "Manuscript Formatting."] </P>

<P>Briefer commentaries/new slants/current scholarly finds/improvised  conversations with book-length works of scholarship, original collections  of poems or other innovative written forms. Poets, scholars, graduate students  and readers are equally invited to share speculations and partial, in-process  lines of inquiry. Send ideas for &quot;alerts&quot; contributions to: Ann  Vickery &lt;<a href="mailto:vickery_ann@yahoo.com">vickery_ann@yahoo.com</a> &gt;.

<P CLASS="REDHEADER">=translation=</P>

<P>Our regular translation section will attempt to vary the  focus on a different language from issue to issue, featuring poetry (& related  poetics/journal/essay writing) by one or two women poets per language. We  will sometimes include bi-lingual texts, depending upon the translator's  decision. If you are translating into English a poet you think we might  be interested in, please propose your idea to our Translation Coordinator,  Cole Swensen <<a href="mailto:xoxocole@cs.com">xoxocole@cs.com</a>&gt;.  [See "<A HREF="../announce.htm">how to</A>" for guidelines to Manuscript  Formating.]  </P>

<A NAME="forum"></A>
<P CLASS="REDHEADER">^forum^</P>

<P>^forum^ is an on-going discussion site focused on one particular  question per issue proposed by a revolving guest editor who will both conceive  of the question and invite specific respondees, as well as select from reader  responses. Reader views will be forwarded to the next issue's guest editor.  Forum remarks will, in most cases, be excerpted if included and will be  chosen with an eye for introducing varying points-of-view. The guest editor  for issue N. 3 is Wendy Tronrud (<a href="mailto:tronik@hotmail.com">tronik@hotmail.com</a>).  [For the next Forum question & editor, go to the end of this section.]  </P>

<P>)postcard is HOW2's mailbox for response to any materials that have appeared in the previous issue, including the FORUM discussion. This will NOT be a list.serv or a "chatbox" format, but an edited selection of e-mail with an eye to keeping the selections discretely varied, rather than repetitive in their overlapping. Comments, arguments, views, quotes, anecdotes, suggestions, feedback should be sent--in tandem--to <A HREF="MAILTO:kfraser@sfsu.edu">kfraser@sfsu.edu</A> and <A HREF="mailto:twoswirl@aol.com">twoswirl@aol.com</A> </P>
