<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I begin with a coffee/mug of espresso. Then, having shut the door to my somewhat cluttered study, usually I will gather various texts (the more diverse the better &#151; always one canonical), choose a form, (the form might be a sonnet with borrowed line-endings from a poem in front of me, some form from Lewis Turco&#146;s book, or an acrostic; sometimes, I will write out an inherited form from memory, for e.g. &#147;the love letter&#148;), while all the while I try to remain open to chance, and at any time may beg in to play.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Flipping through the books I have in front of me, I write out phrases that catch my eye, until a 2-3 page list has been formed (often during this process the worlds transform into homophones); eventually, I get a dei sire to box them all up, and start planting phrases into the forum. Usually, phrases lead to other associated phrases, especially from the folk vernacular, or further homophones, or clinamatic moments &#151; and sow sum how, the poem comes a bout.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Through 10-20 drafts, ray vision tends to word in air <I>gee! </I>and away from ditz, a point meant. Finally, I read the who&#146; all thing out lawed, show the peace to my part noir in cry hymn and my free &#146;uns at <I>Verse, </I>and then send watt ever it is into the whirled.</P>
