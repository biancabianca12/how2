<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For a couple of years the line &#147;this world and all of its details could vanish&#148; has been in my mind, although I&#146;ve not succeeded in living my life mindful of that idea. This world and all of its details <I>will</I> vanish; perhaps they already have; perhaps that&#146;s memory, or the memories we can&#146;t remember. Or the future. Or something in between.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We have worlds to learn from other species, all of whom we need to approach with respect and kindness. How foolishly we waste them. Dinosaurs past and present. Beauty beyond science.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The images in this poem are related the way all the images in daily life are related &#151; something outside of &#147;me&#148; is driving. Some days are more thematic than others; most days are collages or strata or floods or accidents that aren&#146;t. Everything interwoven. Ride the connections.</P>

<P CLASS="TITLE2">voices of the dinosaurs</P>

<P>1.</P>

<P>this world and all of its details could vanish</P>

<P>
<BR>2.</P>

<P>i didn&#146;t know when to expect you or if to expect you at all 
<BR>i had a feeling there was a cake in the garbage can 
<BR>the voices of the dinosaurs haunt me in particular the wand-necked ones 
<BR>i believe i have known them 
<BR>i have listened to them gossip 
<BR>is this some kind of lunatic conspiracy like the ones that say history never happened? 
<BR>did someone say there were never any dinosaurs? 
<BR>i&#146;ve heard them singing alone and in chorus 
<BR>sometimes like mockingbirds they imitate woodland sounds 
<BR>some of them sound like monkeys although there aren&#146;t any monkeys yet 
<BR>somehow they hear them</P>

<P>now that the floor is shiny in here the table legs rest on themselves 
<BR>i don&#146;t think the room they made the dinosaurs stay in was even this large 
<BR>i don&#146;t know who they is 
<BR>but i know they were mistaken</P>

<P>i don&#146;t hear as much from you as i used to 
<BR>the voice of your wristwatch was nervous and slow 
<BR>like a wand-necked dinosaur a small one 
<BR>today there are buds on the acacia but it&#146;s not yet spring 
<BR>and someone will be disappointed before too long</P>

<P>we don&#146;t know where bridge street is 
<BR>so we cannot cross over</P>

<P>
<BR>3.</P>

<P>the voices of the dinosaurs committed the first opera 
<BR>they had been well cast in a tragedy of hours 
<BR>their voices woven in and out with fronds and ferns 
<BR>and they died in the end like opera stars swooning 
<BR>gazing into one another&#146;s eyes acknowledging eternity begetting no one</P>

<P>once again a bridge dream this time water sneaks up over the edge 
<BR>and we wade in black shoes and acknowledge our eternity</P>

<P>my brother said a chamber-hearted dinosaur has been found</P>

<P>hard to believe it was no human&#146;s fault the dinosaurs died 
<BR>hard to imagine they simply had to leave us when they left us 
<BR>hard treatment of animals has left me suspicious 
<BR>today&#146;s heavy rain has washed away the snow leaving rivulets 
<BR>rain enough for dinosaurs 
<BR>rain for the cock-robins yet to arrive 
<BR>rain to forgive me</P>

<P>
<BR>4.</P>

<P>use not roman numerals unless you are roman 
<BR>does that orange &#147;x&#148; mean the tree is coming down 
<BR>and what about the woman walking past it 
<BR>we have a plant in a birdcage trying to get out i would love to cut the cage 
<BR>my husband says no two giraffes&#146; spots are the same 
<BR>and that one of the first things he remembers learning 
<BR>is that the human race could not survive without insects 
<BR>last night a dream about a sea urchin and peter o&#146;toole 
<BR>nodder dolls we saw on the <I>antiques roadshow</I> fashioned after the beatles 
<BR>and it struck me that in our minds we all have nodder dolls of those who&#146;ve hurt us 
<BR>and whenever the landscape trembles the little heads-on-springs begin to nod 
<BR>and they nod and they nod and they trouble us a lot 
<BR>i have dinosaur nodder dolls and they trouble me a lot 
<BR>especially the wand-necked ones 
<BR>wand-necked like guitars playing &#147;wipeout&#148; suddenly during a ballad 
<BR>dinosaur fingers sliding expertly down the strings</P>

<P>
<BR>5.</P>

<P>this world and all of its details could vanish</P>

<P>one man and one dinosaur obscure one another mysteriously 
<BR>like a tire in a nail 
<BR>i dream white wrought iron lawn chairs tipped over in the snow 
<BR>as the dinosaurs are tipped 
<BR>the architectural worries of the millions of dinosaur years 
<BR>expanses of snow-covered ice on rivers 
<BR>injured geese still feeding 
<BR>dragging their broken wings like capes across the snow 
<BR>mirrors melting like ice around sunny faces 
<BR>i dream ceilings of the great gymnasiums hung with rows of inflatable boats 
<BR>but no one is escaping</P>

<P>the dinosaurs voices are long like water under water 
<BR>these two branches long winched together are unhooked now by the wind</P>

<P>i dream of committing murder then of calling 911 
<BR>because the victim isn&#146;t dead 
<BR>or not as dead as my poor dinosaurs</P>

<P>
<BR>6.</P>

<P>now that someone has tried to break in we know that the door lock works 
<BR>the wand-necked dinosaurs move with the grace of camels 
<BR>the grace of dinosaurs 
<BR>what did they smell like &#151; do they smell like lizards? 
<BR>in other words a smell like mossy air 
<BR>the dinosaurs tried to break into my dream 
<BR>to tell me i am forgiven 
<BR>the lecturer says our hands create empathy with the figure-drawing 
<BR>because you always know where your hands are 
<BR>i am old now and these children watch me write 
<BR>those two branches are unhooked now over the water 
<BR>and i dream of the water again and the dinosaurs who love me 
<BR>the heads of dinosaurs high now on a dream of absent fear 
<BR>still crave our alien hearts</P>

<P>we&#146;re not sure why they love us</P>

<P>their hands might have been the size of our hands 
<BR>they might have just turned into hawks and flown away</P>

<P>
<BR>7.</P>

<P>i&#146;m not sure why you love me 
<BR>in the snow everything can be seen so clearly the dinosaurs&#146; luminescent green 
<BR>blue yellow red and purple (for surely they were not brown were perhaps even striped 
<BR>or chequered like cabs or dazzled in paisley) 
<BR>against spiky black trees lemon air and wedgewood sky 
<BR>this gift of a red-tailed hawk up close to the kitchen window 
<BR>holds me in thrall and indeed i cannot move or i&#146;ll be seen he&#146;ll fly away 
<BR>my husband says it is another visitation 
<BR>yes you can read it this way it is not hard 
<BR>this is the way your mind arises 
<BR>a thousand kinds of sparrows maybe a slight exaggeration not too much 
<BR>all at the feeder at the same time what is that grey-eyed bird what is that white one 
<BR>i do see white 
<BR>white against the white snow a white bird impossible yes impossible 
<BR>must be white cloud snow flying 
<BR>or the frosty breath of the dinosaurs</P>

<P>
<BR>8.</P>

<P>a distortion in the window glass makes it look like squirrels leaping 
<BR>in the blue spruces 
<BR>i was sleeping when the fifteenth apple fell 
<BR>and the groundhog we&#146;d never quite forgotten went to sleep 
<BR>in his plaid quilted jacket 
<BR>o this world and all of its details could vanish 
<BR>a phone faintly ringing in the background 
<BR>you&#146;ve forgotten the intricate games you invented as a child 
<BR>in your world populated by you and the dinosaurs 
<BR>o i would like to tell you they are sleeping 
<BR>and their voices are only silent through the dream that we are dreaming 
<BR>i wish i didn&#146;t have to show you this crazy polaroid of the dinosaurs 
<BR>in which they are fading away instead of fading into sight 
<BR>all of this because we didn&#146;t believe in time 
<BR>all of this because we couldn&#146;t imagine their voices</P>
