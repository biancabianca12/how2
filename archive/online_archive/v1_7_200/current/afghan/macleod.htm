<P CLASS="TITLE">Working Note</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These poems were written over the period of a couple of years, after having moved to a semi-rural setting on Vancouver Island after thirteen years in Vancouver.</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Certainly the landscape of my new home influenced this work&#151;living on acreage, working a large garden, being closer to forests and ocean&#151;the details of daily life change sharply when one moves out of large city.</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A second influence, more significantly, was a trip to India in 1999 and a continued exploration of Buddhist teachings. These poems retrace trails first explored in work written years ago, but readings in Buddhist literature have perhaps clarified some of the questions: the nature of self and desire, of faith and time, of love.</P>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I remind myself over and over of the importance of process over product, of seeing beyond expectations of results. I believe this has led to a closer relationship with narrative in my work&#151;a gentler approach to both following the story and to letting it go.</P>

<P>I.</P>
<P>I have won and lost 
<BR>great insight&#151;worn skin as art 
<BR>and starved my heart until 
<BR>I could not see beyond 
<BR>my grasping fingers</P>
<P>you who loved the telling 
<BR>more than love itself 
<BR>spoke poetry on chairs addressing 
<BR>drinking crowds in dim lit rooms</P>
<P> Words were our gift. Those moments when 
<BR>meaning was meaningless&#151;</P>
<P>it was not faith, but fear that shouted</P>
<P>It took the poorest and most wretched 
<BR>to scratch my diamond heart</P>
<P>(But&#160; remember the mistakes you made were caused by the mistakes you made</P>
<P>This simple process. The world inside 
<BR>the kitchen, in the garden, in the guestroom 
<BR>sleeping</P>
<P>II.</P>
<P>If memory exists&#151;</P>
<P> it waits in hands and fingertips, in bones 
<BR>and feet, in&#160; tired shoulders</P>
<P>Sometimes I am within 
<BR>seconds of the immediate</P>
<P>sometimes years keep me 
<BR>apart</P>
<P>Collapse all time, all fractions, multiples 
<BR>of weeks and days</P>
<P>We&#146;re left with pieces, dreams that wake us 
<BR>promising to not be dreams</P>
<P>Imagine yourself close 
<BR>to death, the rumpled deathbed 
<BR>hovering mourners, awaiting 
<BR>final words, a revelation</P>
<P>This is life 
<BR>you have been told</P>
<P>death joyously remembers 
<BR>life, stops counting</P>

<P><I>Nov. 12</I></P>
<P>We are influenced by light 
<BR>its absence</P>
<P>on winter afternoons 
<BR>makes us uneasy. Yellow leaves</P>
<P>rival the sun for brilliance. 
<BR>Between mountain and ocean</P>
<P>the city sleeps. We too are waiting 
<BR>This winter El Nino promises warming</P>
<P>on the coast. Global winds 
<BR>they warn us.</P>
<P>Off a stone beach we watched 
<BR>feeding salmon&#160; charge the water&#146;s surface.</P>
<P>The house fills with nesting 
<BR>spiders and small rodents.</P>
<P><I>Nov. 23</I></P>
<P>This peculiar season brings 
<BR>a few hours of intense sun. Bulbs</P>
<P>extend themselves, unwary 
<BR>Whose rules or power do we bend to?</P>
<P>A shadow grows 
<BR>over the north garden&#151;</P>
<P>we breathe our history like air 
<BR>and so it shapes us.</P>
<P>This moment perception and mystery 
<BR>coalesce.</P>
<P><I>Dec. 5</I></P>
<P> A hard frost this morning&#151; 
<BR>silver grasses</P>
<P>the limbs of trees washed 
<BR>by cold sun. One lesson</P>
<P>learned over and over: 
<BR>we reach through</P>
<P>impossible silence. A year ago 
<BR>the snow was soft and thick</P>
<P>and hid us well. I am watching 
<BR>at the window&#151;</P>
<P>in the long grass beyond the fence 
<BR>I see your signal</P>
<P>one hand against the metal sky</P>
<P><I>Dec. 10</I></P>
<P>Rain diminishes the landscape&#151;.</P>
<P>the field of sodden grass 
<BR>black trees knotted</P>
<P>with shrunken fruit. 
<BR>The gardener, behind glass, surveys 
<BR>muddy furrows, imagines better months ahead.</P>
<P>We know the day to day as warden. 
<BR>Approaching winter solstice&#151;</P>
<P>the year is changed 
<BR>by absence, promises.</P>
<P><I>Dec. 21</I></P>
<P>It is enough 
<BR>to keep pace with the day sinking</P>
<P>into darkness&#151;the brief glow of sun 
<BR>frozen on cedars, laurels.</P>
<P>The path narrows under the black trees 
<BR>milky ice along the road.</P>
<P>Tomorrow darkness will come 
<BR>a fraction later.</P>
<P>Last night through the telescope 
<BR>we watched four moons</P>
<P>tailing a distant planet, 
<BR>the startling rings of Saturn.</P>
<P>A gentle shift in light and time&#151;</P>
<P>a planet 
<BR>crosses the sky to morning.</P>

<P CLASS="TITLE"><A NAME="curve"></A>Curve</P> 

<P>Not as secret as it has been. 
<BR>Nor does the thin world engage us. 
<BR>Last night a deer entered 
<BR>the backyard, stalking 
<BR>the sweet lips of the new lilies. 
<BR>The story finishes without me.</P>
<P>The wind over the strait 
<BR>brings weather. Waiting patiently 
<BR>for life, strangers and acquaintances 
<BR>keel over. Such a waste, we mutter, 
<BR>imagining new graves, the quick scent 
<BR>of turned earth.</P>
<P>The focus of our lives becomes 
<BR>smaller and smaller, so that 
<BR>the stirring of a leaf enchants 
<BR>us. Thus, one&#146;s heart 
<BR>beats steadily and calmly 
<BR>inside a curve of time 
<BR>and latitude.</P>
<P>We woke this morning 
<BR>beside the river&#146;s muddy breathing&#151; 
<BR>scrape of a wings outside the window. 
<BR>Soon, the house will be gone, the scene 
<BR>will have absorbed us. Creatures 
<BR>poise beside the water&#146;s edge. 
<BR>Birds lift into the sky 
<BR>shedding questions.</P>

<P CLASS="TITLE"><A NAME="ind"></A>India</P>

<P>I</P>
<P>Cross legged in the temple 
<BR>rolling voices, nestled candles</P>
<P>chanting: 
<BR>this is art, this is not art 
<BR>this is love, this is not love</P>
<P>A memory:&#160; your hand on my shoulder 
<BR>I turned and flew 
<BR>a thousand miles in your eyes</P>
<P>The lama built 
<BR>a butter sculpture in the woods 
<BR>a creature draped 
<BR>in entrails, in the dawn</P>
<P> we were leaving 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; for the city and the hot plains</P>
<P> I placed a rupee at its feet 
<BR>and asked for love 
<BR>safe journeys, wisdom</P>
<P>monkeys singing with compassion 
<BR>as we travel home</P>
<P>II</P>
<P>The old heart struggles in the night 
<BR>beating red and firm as a young plum, 
<BR>wakes me 
<BR>from a new dream</P>
<P>This time, <I>this</I> time 
<BR>arms spread wide, a hundred arms</P>
<P>we&#146;re flying, buoyant, hopeful</P>
<P>over a thousand mile plain of dusty roads and aged cities 
<BR>purple in the new light, the bathers 
<BR>in the river praying 
<BR>hands cupped</P>
<P> fringed in gold 
<BR>almost naked 
<BR>bathed in plum and gold</P>
