<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Our lives are influenced by our experiences, and in turn affect the very essence of our societies.&#160; All forms of art are the outlets for the laughter and tears of our souls.&#160;&#160; May we never limit or suppress the sounds of laughter and the flow of tears that express our souls and reflect upon life and humanity as we bear and feel it.&#160; Through the years my tears have colored the images on any available surface I could have used&#151;the image of the dead young boy at the gates of Masturat Hospital, the half empty milk bottle and his late arriving poor parents lost in grief, the crippled child on the side walks of Kabul, the little boy next to an empty Kraft cheese can thrown away by the rich and...and...Yet my laughter finds its sound through the life&#146;s descending cascades while I cherish the beauty of nature and the secret powers of truth and humanity, as in one of my poems, &#147;What Am I?&#148;,&#160; I end it with:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 

<P>I can hush the cry&#146;s echo in hallow nights. 
<BR>See? 
<BR>I look at the young green leaves, 
<BR>And touch so tenderly 
<BR>The yellow buttercups, the dew drops at dawns. 
<BR>Yet, raindrops in gray twilights 
<BR>Sadly pause and run on my soul, 
<BR>And I smile a shrewd little smile, 
<BR>While it hurts, 
<BR>While it burns... 
<BR>What am I?</P>

<P>Such a sad silence... 
<BR>This bottom-less whirlpool of grief 
<BR>Oo...the gasping airless senses 
<BR>and the old dry tears 
<BR>still burning, 
<BR>running 
<BR>on dusty ruins of Beloved Ariana 
<BR>Did I hear her bitter laughter? 
<BR>Did I hear Her whisper?,</P>
<P>&#147;I Will Never Be Gone...

<P>I am there, where you live. 
<BR>I am breathing, a helpless child, 
<BR>a fragment in adults&#146; game 
<BR>forgotten in adults&#146; world...</P>

<P>Do you know me?</P>
