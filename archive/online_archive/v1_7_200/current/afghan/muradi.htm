<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These pieces are taken from my manuscript, &#147;A Bat is a Leather Butterfly, or the Wonder of Being Several,&#148; a series of memoirs about growing up between Afghan and American cultures.&#160; In Dari, the compound &#147;leather butterfly&#148; signifies &#147;bat,&#148; and here it alludes to my own compound identity as an Afghan-American woman.</P>

<P CLASS="TITLE2"><A NAME="exile"></A>Exile, or my father's elbow</P>


<P>Everyday Bob walks into the caf&#233; and asks my father, hey, Ali, how&#146;s that 
<BR>elbow? </P>
<P>My father stands behind the register, his elbow propped up on the counter, 
<BR>his head in his hand, and looks out the window.</P>

<P>Bob laughs, don&#146;t work that elbow too hard now!</P>

<P>He loves the water, where there is a lake, a canal even, he stands for 
<BR>hours, silent, lost in it.</P>

<P>It is lunchtime and my mother is making sandwiches, a dozen a minute, and 
<BR>chatting with customers over her shoulder and whispering in Farsi to my 
<BR>father: who ordered what, extra bacon, on a sub roll, large or small salad, 
<BR>and my father, not hearing, making wrong calculations, the window at his 
<BR>side, my father will disappear.</P>

<P>Sometimes it is the water, and sometimes it is the freezer, the trunk of the 
<BR>car, the television, a closet, but it is worse with a bowl of pomegranate, a 
<BR>plate of watermelon, a dish of dates, when he does not simply go back, he 
<BR>compares.</P>

<P>Bob says, but, Ali, it&#146;s just a parking lot.</P>

<P>In Flagstaff, Arizona (on a family trip), on the side of the road outside a 
<BR>fish restaurant, where the river cut through the rocks and we knelt among 
<BR>them and ate chabli kabobs, he said, this is Paghman.</P>

<P>During dinner, between spoonfuls of qorma challow, he tells us about the 
<BR>white snaking pattern in the mountains of Mazar-i-Sharif said to be the 
<BR>spirit of Hazrat Ali, about Zohake Mahran, &#147;King of Two Snakes,&#148; and his 
<BR>pair of reptiles which he wore like scarves around his neck and fed human 
<BR>brains to every day, and about the Koh-i-Nor diamond, the size of a human 
<BR>head, looted from India, inherited by king after king, and, when the British 
<BR>arrived, hidden for years within a wall in Jalalabad.</P>

<P>Bob asks, between you and me, who works harder you think, your wife or your 
<BR>elbow?</P>

<P>In his first phonecalls to us at college, he asked us to look up old atlases 
<BR>in the libraries, to send him copies of the ancient maps of Persia and 
<BR>Baluchistan, of countries that no longer exist.</P>

<P>My mother will say, instead of memorizing all those dates and places and 
<BR>stories, why don't you learn the prices?</P>

<P>Every night he goes online, elbow on the desk, hand at his lips, glasses 
<BR>dripping down his nose, and reads the latest news.</P>

<P>You will wear down the skin, Bob teases.</P>

<P>Shabnam is on the floor of our room, blooming brown globes out of her little 
<BR>black lycra top, and counting.&#160; Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven in 
<BR>hot, heavy breaths, arms crossed behind her head and legs pedaling an 
<BR>imaginary bicycle.&#160; She is riding out of our room in Louie&#146;s house, past the 
<BR>too-narrow door on our nighttime whispers, past the kitchen of her sweet 
<BR>grief, past the bathroom where madar is convinced the tampon absorbed her 
<BR>daughter&#146;s purity, past the telephone of boyfriends who silence to a suicide 
<BR>when padar answers, she is sweating fifty, fifty-one, fifty-two past the TV 
<BR>that is her only permissible hobby, the TV that tells her she must pedal 
<BR>faster, the TV that fires a rash of red shame across her body when a man and 
<BR>woman moan and madar&#146;s teething glare cuts her and says, now is a good time 
<BR>to make conversation, to change the channel, to get a drink of water from 
<BR>the kitchen, she is panting seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four past 
<BR>the soft blue sofa where her legs sometimes forget their decency, past the 
<BR>coffee table where she dutifully sets padar&#146;s chai every night after dinner, 
<BR>past the glass door toward the lake where we swim in long t-shirts after 
<BR>padar pointed out all the glass doors on the lake, she is pedaling 
<BR>eighty-five, eighty-six, eighty-seven past Olsen Middle School and the girls 
<BR>who didn&#146;t inherit two unwieldy worlds beneath their shirts or the skin of 
<BR>animals on their arms, past Hollywood International Airport, where our 
<BR>grandfather, arriving with his month-long suitcase from another son&#146;s house 
<BR>and a face full of sickness and complaint and judgment, said to her, in the 
<BR>name of God are you big!, pushing ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine 
<BR>past the city limits, past the state line, past the landscape of America 
<BR>that stretches as long as a curse, one hundred&#151;when the door rips open and 
<BR>padar&#146;s face cracks like a plate over Shabnam&#146;s body, over her skin, and two 
<BR>worlds rising up, and the red shards of his mouth scream, put a shirt on! </P>
