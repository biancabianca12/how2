<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><B>Working Note:</B> I wrote this piece as part of a major work called FRAGMENTATIONS in my third year of university. The work deals with issues of border crossing, feminism and identities. It uses experimental language and fictocriticism.&#160; &#147;Afghanistan&#148; is a true story of an actual event which happened to me when I was a child and everything in it is true to the best of memory.</P>

<HR>

<P CLASS="TITLE2">Afghanistan...</P>

<P>Paper is falling out of the sky. I am in the garden. 
<BR>It&#146;s sunny day. It comes back to me in slow 
<BR>motion. I&#146;m three years old. My father is often 
<BR>amazed at the fact that I should remember this far 
<BR>back into my childhood. I tell him the&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<BR>memories are unforgettable. </P>
<P>Paper continues to fall, communist&#160; 
<BR>propaganda literally rains down on us. The 
<BR>helicopters are so noisy, so high in the sky. I 
<BR>stand looking up, my arms are wide open.&#160; I want 
<BR>to catch all the pieces of falling paper.</P>

<P>Paper, paper, everywhere</P>

<P>At least it&#146;s better than when they decide to shower 
<BR>us with bullets.</P>

<P>Mother is at work. She is a teacher at the school 
<BR>across the street. You can see it when you 
<BR>go outside the huge walls of my grandparents&#146; 
<BR>property.</P>

<P>The walls are made of the thick hay and mud.&#160; I 
<BR>remember the walls. The height of them makes me 
<BR>feel protected.&#160; I imagine that these walls 
<BR>are strong enough to stop the rockets.</P>

<P>I go inside the house to play behind the big black 
<BR>couch in the main guestroom. This is where we 
<BR>hide when the sirens sound in the middle of the 
<BR>night.</P>

<P>One night, I hear my father pray for us to die 
<BR>together if we are hit. That night he holds mother 
<BR>and I close to him. I can feel him shivering as I 
<BR>secretly agree with him. I&#146;ve never seen father 
<BR>frightened before.</P>

<P>Now, I play with my big red doll when it happens. I 
<BR>hear a loud noise. I know it is a bomb. I run out 
<BR>into the garden. Somehow, I find my hand in my 
<BR>aunt&#146;s hand and I am being pulled behind her.</P>

<P>Small feet try to keep up.</P>

<P>Everyone gathers outside, 
<BR>smoke rises from the direction of the school. I see 
<BR>it come up over the wall. The noise numbs my ears. 
<BR>There is screaming and shouting on the other side 
<BR>where mother is.</P>

<P>We run out of the gates, into the street, though I 
<BR>am hesitant.&#160; I don&#146;t want to see her pieces lying 
<BR>before me. She would be coming home for 
<BR>lunch now.</P>

<P>All I see is smoke. My heart has stopped, my 
<BR>knees shake, I know she&#146;s gone. Everyone is 
<BR>crying. My grandmother holds me.&#160; My head is on her 
<BR>chest and I watch the smoke. I don&#146;t say a word. I want 
<BR>her to walk out of the smoke. That&#146;s all I want.</P>

<P>I break free of my grandmother. I stand alone, but 
<BR>I do not cry. After that I don&#146;t remember what 
<BR>happens. What I do recall is my mother, running 
<BR>out of the smoke. She runs towards me. I&#146;m in her 
<BR>arms. I can smell her.&#160; She smells of mother.&#160; She 
<BR>holds me tight.&#160; She cries as she whispers &#147;we have 
<BR>to get away from here.&#148;</P>

<P>My mouth is dry.</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><B>Bio:</B> I was born in 1977 in Herat Afghanistan. Since then have lived in India and now Sydney, Australia. I have a degree in Journalism and creative writing and have worked for newspapers and radio. I have also worked as a Project Manager and am interested in multimedia and web design. Currently I am working as a Sports producer at a commercial radio station in Sydney. Part of my free time is spent in reading biographies of classical and modern writers, writing poetry and working with a women&#146;s charity group. One day I would love to publish my own book and be known as a writer.</P>
