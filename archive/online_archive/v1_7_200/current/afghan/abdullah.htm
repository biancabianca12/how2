<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My writing process is in some sense the other side of the image-making impulse; a poem for me is a pulsing image literally and figuratively made of words.&#160; Like a painter I will try to re-write the same image until I am satisfied with its capture in the words.&#160; Sometimes when images return to me from a past that seems all the more uncanny, silent scenes from a life lived in Afghanistan, I try to transform them either into colors, words or simply sounds.&#160; What remains of me then in the process?&#160; Possibly how I/it feel(s)	its/my powerlessness in the face of something that continues to slip.</P>

<P>The lights always flicker in the mosque. My feet are   
<BR>cold this evening from the muddy streets and rain.   
<BR>The inside of the mosque throbs with the shadows the   
<BR>candles throw on the walls. The air is fragrant with   
<BR>the smell of burning candles. With the smell of the   
<BR>war outside.   
<BR>
<BR>My mother tells me to light a candle and make a wish.   
<BR>What wish did I have at the age of 8? What kinds of   
<BR>wishes do children have at that age? Now, I have many,   
<BR>which drop in the spaces I leave behind.   
<BR>
<BR>Standing in the mosque then, I did not know that a   
<BR>couple of years later I would become a refugee. I   
<BR>had lost many things, small things, marking the   
<BR>boundaries of my small universe. But how does one lose   
<BR>a country, from where does it slip one&#146;s grip?   
<BR>
<BR>The carpet in the mosque has a musky smell from the   
<BR>foot traffic. There are folds that trip people here   
<BR>and there. Light and dark play on the threadbare   
<BR>carpet. I sit in a corner of the mosque away from the   
<BR>worshippers and try to imagine things. I always day-   
<BR>dreamed as a child for which I always got in trouble both in   
<BR>school and at home. &#147;Pay attention, look around you   
<BR>so you can remember, focus.&#148; There was so much to see.   
<BR>
<BR>Now I tell my mother I am glad I did not pay attention   
<BR>all those years. It was better to daydream, to   
<BR>imagine what it was that people were doing moving from   
<BR>one place to another. I used to think that we were   
<BR>all waiting for someone or something.   
<BR>
<BR>If I remembered everything,   
<BR>I would probably not be able   
<BR>to continue living these screams.   
<BR>I imagined a dead body lying across   
<BR>the floor of the mosque and the   
<BR>worshippers sitting around it   
<BR>praying for its soul.   
<BR>Praying for a missing body.   
<BR>
<BR>I can hear the whispering sounds of the worshippers   
<BR>reciting from the Quran. Returning home, my mother   
<BR>places the beautifully bound copy of the Quran   
<BR>somewhere where everyone can see. It&#146;s better that   
<BR>way, she says. Everyone always wore a black veil.   
<BR>Or was it because of the funerals. It&#146;s hard to tell   
<BR>what they are saying from where I am. Underneath   
<BR>the translucent veil, I can see their glowing faces only   
<BR>here and there criss-crossed with the path of   
<BR>kohl-ed tears.</P>

<P CLASS="TITLE2"><A NAME="blink"></A>Blink</P>
<P>Blink as though lashes heavy with tears,&#160;&#160;&#160;</P>
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (webbed sunless horizons)</P>
<P>Ropes rubbing  against one other as if</P>

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (sound of entangled bodies)</P>

<P>They are one, in the presence of the cube.   
<BR>Everything is equidistant   
<BR>from here. Same too.   
<BR>
<BR>Blinking,   
<BR>looking into distances she has yet to travel.   
<BR>
<BR>&#147;Why can&#146;t I?&#148;   
<BR>Why can&#146;t I stop.   
<BR>Why can&#146;t the blinking   
<BR>Stop this?   
<BR>eclipse did they say was it   
<BR>the cause or what   
<BR>did this mean   
<BR>&#147;Take one word at a time from your mouth,&#148;   
<BR>always remembering to replace it   
<BR>when they asked   
<BR>&#147;Tell us what happened   
<BR>We have to learn sadness   
<BR>what was its story you said?&#148;   
<BR>
<BR>Yesterday, we covered the speckled   
<BR>walls without eyes&#151;black-green-blue-brown&#151;   
<BR>red too&#151;   
<BR>when swollen with wind   
<BR>we chewed them until   
<BR>our mouths were sour with the memory&#146;s husks.   
<BR>
<BR>Now, we dance ecstatically   
<BR>to the music   
<BR>our fingers make as   
<BR>we cover the cracks   
<BR>as the wind rages.   
<BR>
<BR>Here, I&#146;ll peel the smile   
<BR>from my lips for your   
<BR>museum.   
<BR>
<BR>&#147;Stop blinking?&#148;   
<BR>I want to remain awake, someone blinking for me.   
<BR>Blink slowly,   
<BR>missing the good parts of the film.</P>
