<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When I was 10 years old I started reading the work of great poems encouraged and helped by my mother. So I think the first base of understanding poetry techniques and formations was established at that time in my mind. Because many years later when I wanted to write poems the idea would come to my mind and I would write it on a piece of paper. Then I didn&#146;t need to reconstruct the verses, add or delete any words. When I am not in the mood of writing a poem, I can&#146;t do it. So it just naturally comes to my mind and I put it on paper. When I showed my first poem to a poet in my faculty, he was surprised and didn&#146;t believe it.&#160; He encouraged me to write whenever such ideas come to my mind.&#160; I almost had a good collection of my poems while I was doing my degree at the university, but I gave it to one of my classmates to keep because I couldn&#146;t take it home.&#160; She went away and took my collection with her.&#160; Since then I didn&#146;t have any access to it.&#160; I must say that because of being a woman I never felt myself so relaxed and free to put on paper whatever comes to my mind due to many restrictions. However, I have a few poems that step out of the framework of the areas I was allowed. </P>

<P>I swear to the restless hearts  
<BR>of wandering people,  
<BR>To the sorrows and miseries of the homeless,  
<BR>To the bitterness and pains of the poor,  
<BR>To the desperate heart of a mournful mother,  
<BR>I swear to the body of a brave soldier&#160; falling for his homeland,  
<BR>I swear to your green valleys  
<BR>high mountains and ever-blue sky,  
<BR>I swear to your brave sons and daughters  
<BR>who stand for you,  
<BR>I swear to the Holy books,  
<BR>I swear to almighty God, the creator,  
<BR>That I shall give  
<BR>Not even a tiny peace of your soil,  
<BR>Oh, my beloved homeland!  
<BR>For the entire world.</P>

<P>I am a fallen fish  
<BR>on a faraway, empty shore,

<BR>If you don&#146;t come to my salvation  
<BR>Oh roaring wave!  
<BR>I&#146;ll die of the thirst.</P>
