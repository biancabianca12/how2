<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As a poet, I value memories and believe in the healing nature of sharing	particularly traumatic memories. The airing out of old wounds is what will	help us move ahead to a healthy future as a people from a country which has	experienced war continuously for the past two decades. On a personal level,	by giving voice to my families&#146; and my own memories, I am trying to fit	us all under the one skin of writing. It is perhaps the only way I've been	able to reconnect my extended family, who have been scattered across the globe	and suffered tremendous losses since the Soviet-Afghan war.</P>

<P CLASS="TITLE2"><A NAME="scar"></A>What the Scar Revealed...</P>


<P>1977, Afghanistan: A girl born on Lailatul Qadr, holy night of Ramadaan. </P>
<P>Her mother tilts her head back to face the sky.&#160; The night is smoother than 
<BR>her amber skin.&#160; Young mother sees spirits walking across the sky with stars 
<BR>blossoming at each step. </P>
<P>The stars join as a single thread of daylight 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A gold streak across twilight. </P>
<P>Grandmothers tell the story of healing; how wounds heal only after they have 
<BR>memorized the moment of hurt.&#160; A newborn&#146;s navel is the same as any wound.&#160; 
<BR>To heal, the cut navel swallows the city and remembers its fragrance.&#160; 
<BR>Turquoise domes, spice vendors, pomegranates like hearts, and the adhaan in 
<BR>her ear are consumed by this bloody wound. </P>
<P>April 1978: A revolution tangles ribs and spines with iron and steel. </P>
<P>Smuggled under veils and old pots, she ties borderlines into knots.&#160; After 
<BR>suckling her mother&#146;s fingers for days in the desert, she throws a tinseled 
<BR>veil up to the sky and catches lapis-colored doves.&#160; Quartered and roasted, 
<BR>the doves whisper God back into the wanderers&#146; sleep. </P>
<P>1998, New York City: In an apartment overlooking a blue-gray street, her 
<BR>mother&#146;s veil hangs on the wall like a talisman.&#160; Her lapis doves and 
<BR>tinseled mountains are misplaced and glorified behind plates of glass at 
<BR>museums.&#160; She visits them weekly and cleans the glass between them.&#160; </P>
<P>When Lailatul Qadr comes again, she is over a bridge between Brooklyn and 
<BR>Manhattan.&#160; While the night is threaded in gold, the lost city in her navel 
<BR>unwinds itself from swirls of skin and slips over this new city like a fog. </P>

<HR>

<P CLASS="TITLE2"><A NAME="nomad"></A>Nomad's Market: Flushing Queens</P>


<P>Two hours by train from Brooklyn 
<BR>to wander in shops named after lost cities, 
<BR>enamored by bags full of 
<BR>overpriced ingredients to my parents&#146; memories. </P>
<P>Holidays have been lonely 
<BR>since the swarm of children 
<BR>tugging at my elbows grew up 
<BR>and went to high school. 
<BR>Even lonelier since I grew out of frocks 
<BR>and into ankle-grazing dresses. </P>
<P>The shops are obsessed with maps here and enlarged pictures from Afghanistan. 
<BR>I can sketch the map in the air from memory: 
<BR>It&#146;s shape&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; a human heart. </P>
<P>An immense pop singer winks at me 
<BR>by the meat freezer, 
<BR>Ahmad Zahir, 
<BR>who may as well have been Elvis, 
<BR>guards the freshness of halal. </P>
<P>I remember him from pirate videotapes 
<BR>passed from neighbor to neighbor 
<BR>until his face was a white blur on the screen. 
<BR>But my mother and all seven aunts 
<BR>danced in the living room. 
<BR>In the next room, 
<BR>the children were hypnotized 
<BR>by Bugs Bunny.&#160; </P>
<P>Grand mosques with turquoise domes gleam above plastic bins of tea leaves, 
<BR>saffron, and dried violets, blessing the shop with prosperity. </P>
<P>The small television 
<BR>placed on the counter at an angle 
<BR>run musical videos of beautiful women 
<BR>singing folk songs from Jalalabad 
<BR>and Kandahar, decked in gold, 
<BR>eyes swept with surma. 
<BR>They keep their eyes averted 
<BR>and carry themselves as if being arranged in a marriage. 
<BR>There is no dancing here. 
<BR>Most likely, it is their husbands who play 
<BR>the tabla behind them.&#160; </P>
<P>Strands of home dance through 
<BR>aisles of Pepsi and Heinz, 
<BR>chocolates and cigarettes. </P>
<P>The shopkeeper&#146;s son 
<BR>circles around me, pretending to 
<BR>rearrange layers of velvet prayer mats. 
<BR>He has spotted another exile... </P>

<HR>

<P CLASS="TITLE2"><A NAME="voices"></A>Voices: Archive of Spines</P>


<P>I serve a tray of pine nuts, dried apricots, thin slivers of chocolate and 
<BR>cups of perfumed tea for the guests who have come.</P>

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160; Laughter slips from mouths. 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Carefully, I archive their round existence. </P>
<P>Father entertains with accounts of his children&#146;s brilliance.&#160; My sister 
<BR>blushes by my aunt&#146;s side.&#160; She holds the hand of the one she resembles. </P>
<P>For years I have traced their voices, arranged them into stanzas only to see 
<BR>the lines eventually overwhelm them, confuse and lose each other in the 
<BR>stretch of long distance phone calls. </P>
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They reach for sweets&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; one after the other. </P>
<P>Daintily raising tea cups to their mouths, they welcome the coils of steam 
<BR>that whisper against lips and cheeks.&#160;&#160; Here and there, a tale of escaping 
<BR>war, of the texture of tents in refugee camps... </P>
<P>Aunts who have embroidered history onto the hems of sleeves and skirts, 
<BR>exchange coy glances with me, eldest daughter, seeker of stories.&#160; I wait 
<BR>until the warmth of the pink tea has coaxed out family legends, still aching 
<BR>from its closeness to their hearts.&#160; </P>
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Their voices evaporate to the ceiling, then fall on my lips like 
<BR>snow.&#160; 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<BR>I taste the past from which we have escaped with our lives. </P>
