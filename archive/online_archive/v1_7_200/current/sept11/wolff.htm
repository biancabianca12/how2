<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><B>Working Note:</B> I live in downtown Manhattan and watched the attack on the World Trade Center from my roof ten blocks away. This poem was written on September 23 and was the first piece of creative writing that I was able to do after what I had witnessed. It was part of a photography exhibit on Wooster Street called the September 11 Photo Project along with two photographs of mine.</P>

<B>A Different View</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>You have not gotten to see
<BR>Many sides of me
<BR>And I have not really seen you
<BR>A smile here, a quick laugh
<BR>We&#146;ve known each other for years
<BR>But what have we known
<BR>
<BR>On a Tuesday in September I woke up
<BR>To the most beautiful morning
<BR>The air was clear, the sky blue
<BR>But it was just an illusion
<BR>By eleven o&#146;clock I was drinking as I thought of you
<BR>And so many others
<BR>
<BR>Nothing is clear, nothing seems real
<BR>From my roof I had a bird&#146;s eye view
<BR>Of a sight I will always remember
<BR>But will never believe
<BR>
<BR>And what is there to believe after all
<BR>Except the things we feel are true
<BR>One thing I will always believe
<BR>Is that I&#146;ve never been wrong about you
