<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><B>Working Note:</B> When writing this poem, I was feeling the distance from being in New York or DC, compounded by the way I first heard about the September 11 disasters. I only heard about it on the radio (my TV doesn&#146;t work) so I had no visual images, only descriptions.</P>

<P><B>Aftermath&#151;(dis)location</B></P>
<BR>The aftermath is ongoing
<BR>
<BR>It&#146;s___________sunny and pleasant this afternoon
<BR>(mostly, strangely)
<BR>
<BR>________________we are calling our friends
<BR>(safe at home, on the planes, on the 84<SUP>th</SUP> floor)
<BR>saying are you safe? I&#146;m safe. Are you safe?
<BR>
<BR>Do you know whether_________is safe?
<BR>(Name who is supposed to be there, name who
<BR>might be there who usually sleeps late, name
<BR>who shouldn&#146;t be there, name remembered later)
<BR>
<BR>This morning is sunny and pleasant
<BR>The afternoon continues sunny and pleasant
<BR>That weather should be pleasant
<BR>(now, at that time, in this aftermath) is
<BR>
<BR>it is not just one thing, it&#146;s another
<BR>
<BR>(bizarre, ironic, the way the world is)
<BR>
<BR>we are recovering______________
<BR>(undeniable loss, remnants of the recognizable
<BR>world, attentiveness)
<BR>
<BR>The aftermath is ongoing
<BR>
<BR>We are calling our friends, out of the arc
<BR>of loss
<BR>(safe at home we, on the planes we, at our desk
<BR>in a high tower we)
<BR>
<BR>We see things fall, we are inside things that
<BR>fall, we fall
<BR>
<BR>She is outside arguing with him,
<BR>&#147;don&#146;t go to work,&#148;
<BR>
<BR>he wants to go to work because it is a work day
<BR>if he can go to work everything is still there
<BR>
<BR>he will even walk to work to get there and maybe
<BR>walking there will make it be there
<BR>
<BR>while it is happening
<BR>
<BR>cellphones telling us
<BR>
<BR>&#147;don&#146;t go to work,&#148; and they see
<BR>and they turn, they go inside to where
<BR>the television is
<BR>to put it there instead of in the world
<BR>
<BR>We thought we were
<BR>and have been saying this repeatedly
<BR>(safe, too powerful, too nice, too hard-working,
<BR>invulnerable)
<BR>and variations of the above
<BR>
<BR>we were out of the arc of loss
<BR>
<BR>Are we saying &#147;war&#148; to avoid saying &#147;emergency&#148;? or
<BR>&#147;shock&#148;? to give it form?
<BR>
<BR>We are doing laundry
<BR>
<BR>rescue personnel are coated with ash and debris, everything
<BR>is covered with dust so we are doing laundry (we are
<BR>miles away, we are hundreds of miles away, we are right there)
<BR>
<BR>While it is afterwards we are learning
<BR>what had been happening
<BR>
<BR>cellphones telling us
<BR>details brought up topside from below or,
<BR>having fallen, into light
<BR>
<BR>we are recovering
<BR>loss (undeniable) attentiveness
<BR>
<BR>We direct your attention to these landmarks
<BR>there is more to see, not less
<BR>all we have looked away from in our lives
<BR>and&#151;here we are&#151;how can we look away now?
