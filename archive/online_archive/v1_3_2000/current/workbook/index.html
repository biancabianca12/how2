A "built" body that has a life of its own; its own tics,         its own awkwardnesses. On a formal level I was interested in seeing what         would happen if I gave the poem this sort of regularized body?in this         case, standardized syllables?what would that body look and sound like?         would the poem stand for it? would the voice crack? would it start to         bust out? would it grow and mutate? would seams start showing?

At the same         time this is not so simple as the form/body being an extension of content.         What's interesting is the sort of tension and play between two ideas,         that of nature and nurture in terms of how the work comes together.

Were these disparate ideas of cinema, post modernism         and camp at play for you in the writing of the piece?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>MW</b>:         Are you saying that a misogynist werewolf and a giant, French-speaking,         dream-monster are campy?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Which is         to say, when I first talked to you about this project I was thinking about         it as a kind of movie. But that's not quite it now. It might be more accurate         to say that one of the things this piece is about is what movies &quot;make.&quot;         I'm really interested in the ways in which we interact with fictions in         our actual lives; how it is so easy to catch myself making assumptions,         choices, interpretations based on the information I have from stories.         Here at the start of the big new century those fictions come to us most         frequently in convenient film format. This poem's geographical "location"         is at that 70 mm, flickering, potent intersection of fiction/real life         where most (North Americans, anyway) seem to live. I don't suppose this         is anything new to human history, nor is it the sole domain of the talkies         but our cinema feels so big.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JAW</b>:         I also began to re-examine the title as I read the work in terms of a         way of identifying the birthing of your &quot;monster.&quot; The first         line of the poem begins identifying a character with the name, &quot;No         Mother&quot; and I was struck by the absence of mother following fast         on the heels of the title, <i>Frankenstein by Mary Shelley</i>. Frankenstein         being the fictional monster created by a definite &quot;father&quot; but         with the covert mother (Mary Shelley). It seemed that by placing Shelley         in the title you are affirming her progenerative role. Did the ideas of         identity and maternity surface in the poem?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>MW</b>:         Identity. Maternity. Making. Being made. All of these. One of the interesting         things about your question is how you said "Frankenstein being the fictional         monster." Frankenstein is a sort of cultural shorthand for the nameless         monster. On some level, this Frankenstein, Victor, IS the monster. The         shorthand has nailed it. The maker of the monster is just as much Shelley's         "hideous progeny" as is the idea of monster or the book itself or all         the other implications of her phrase. And all of those progeny?fucked-up,         with solo paternity, creation of a mortal Zeus spewing forth the creature         from his head?are secretly mothered but overtly motherless to the extent         that the 1818 debut of the novel was anonymous, the still marginalized         if not (relatively) covert matrilineage that we have access to as writers.         On top of that there is a weird, fateful spin which seems to say, &quot;We've         come such a long way baby so what are you complaining about?&quot; et         cetera.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JAW</b>:         I read &quot;...&amp; I/place a sweet kiss on what might be/its face &amp;         I say good/ night &amp; sweet dreams &amp; I leave on/ a small light...&quot;         and I can?t help but see the square screen of a computer morphing into         the square head of Shelley?s monster.

I have been thinking about Haraway?s essay a lot, too.         I mean, in connection with the section you brought up. When I wrote this         part, I, like many exposed to the Montreal media (probably Canadian, too,         but I only read the provincial paper, not the national one, so I can?t         say) was thinking lots about a particular Montreal event which "celebrated"         its ten year anniversary this past December. A mass slaughter of some         female students at L'Ecole Polytechinique here in Montreal. A disgruntled         gunman took out a gendered threat. Killed a bunch of female science students         who he thought had cheated him out of his big chance to study at the institute.         A female body count. Globally, of course, the number of women who die         because they are women is?what? Not very high? Higher than I know? Exposed         to the media-storm that was going on in Montreal, I could focus on this         number. It was impossible for me not to connect the fictitious female         body count in Shelley's novel with this very real historical event; and         to imagine a creature who was made up of, membered, re-membered, dead         women. Shelley's novel feels made up of dead or silenced women.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To get back         to your initial question, yes, I am interested in connecting, at least         <i>Shelley's</i> monster, with the machine. The notion of a created something         being capable of empathy, sensitivity?humanity which humans have never         been particularly good at evincing. Along with a sort of ugliness which         does not fit into <i>our</i> origin stories. That is in there, with the         root of the word &quot;monster,&quot; etymologically, <i>to show</i>.         Interesting what the monster shows us?what the machine might or could         reveal. This can happen in my aforementioned favorite movie plots. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What happens         when the concept of nurture is tossed aside? Imagining, in terms of the         machine, what a notion of innate sensitivities might be? What we could         conceiveably have to learn from that? This feels like it could be productive.         It is something, at any rate, as Haraway is bent on reminding us, we ought         not shy away from confronting.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JAW</b>:         While the monster seems to translate for the poem, in turns, it ostensibly         obfuscates meanings, &quot;...The monster says:/ <i>malheruse, bon, mon         cher</i>. The monster/ says in a language I do not hear.&quot; Does the         monster?s negotiation of language reflect some of your experience living         in bilingual Montr&eacute;al?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>MW</b>:         Yes and no. On the one hand, I wasn't meaning the monster to be some manifestation         of how I feel like a big, dumb lug when I'm trying to take out books from         the UQAM (University Quebec at Montreal) library in this kind of mangled         tongue that neither anglos nor francophones understand, although I suppose,         thinking about it now, it is sort of an apt metaphor. But I think the         fact of living here and being bombarded by French on a daily basis definitely         made me more attentive and interested/obsessed by the fact that the monster         in Shelley's novel spoke French. It's this wonderful, subtle detail that         adds another layer to the number of layers of mediation of the story that         already exist within the her novel. It takes us a step further away from         the monster representing himself. Not only is his story handed down to         us through the character of Walton's letters, via Frankenstein, but also         we always remember that the story was translated from the "original" French.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JAW</b>:         It feels like other aspects of &quot;North&quot; are in this work. Has         the landscape, the colors, the cold become something &quot;you can not         keep from coming/ in the inside?&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>MW</b>:         It's hard to keep the outside out, even if you are trying to keep the         romanticizing to a minimum. After a year in one of the more treeless and         depressed areas in San Francisco, the outside of Montreal hit me hard.         I spent all summer writing awful poems about green. About giant sky. I         had to get it out, I guess. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Now I want         even more north than this, I want icebergs and polar bears and aurora         borealis and all day sun/ all day night. The fiction of national boundaries,         too. On the one hand it's a seven hour bus ride to NYC, but big shoes,         polartech and shiny fabrics aside its easy enough for a suburban Jersey         girl to wax poetic about the tundra from Montreal. On the other hand,         you cross the border into Vermont and it IS a different landscape. And         it's hard not to get caught up in the preparing-for-winter-mentality of         Canada or in this landscape. I keep thinking about this Rae Armantrout         poem that I read once and have never been able to locate again, something         to the effect of "Going to the desert is the old term/ A landscape of         zeroes. . . "</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JAW</b>:         The jump to a later section, &quot;content/ interlude/ a law of thermodynamics&quot;         returns to imagery of maternity and birthing. Where is the poem reaching         from there?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>MW</b>:         This part is such a break from the previous sections, I'll need to figure         out how to make a more transversable path from one section to the next.         Again this is another stab at locating the poem in that nexus of fiction/real         life. Here it is, specifically, a perpetual loop of action movie tropes         which seem to function in the real world in terrible ways. It's certainly         far more complicated than blaming NBC or the internet for schoolyard murders         or sexism or blind eyes turned to CIA drug dealing, but these fictions         continue to function nonetheless. And how ideas of mothers and progeny         function in these fictional film loops as banners or motivations for not         stopping the loop. The mother/progeny trope promises continued fertility         and prosperity. Such a promises is bizarre, fantastic. An assurance that         God is on &quot;our side&quot; seems connected to this idea of continuing         the loop, no matter how counter-instinctive this idea is. For instance,         SUV emissions, the Gulf War, the body counts, the ubiquitousness of guns         and global warming?these pieces of empirical evidence fly in the face         of the film loop fiction which promises, as though this were a law of         physics, that the great green earth will stay great and green and available         for use by the American capitalist machine. It is that dark, complicated         and currently convoluted place from which the poem is reaching.</font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="3">BIO</font></b><font size="3">:</font></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">         Melissa Weinstein is twenty-six and lives in Montreal.
