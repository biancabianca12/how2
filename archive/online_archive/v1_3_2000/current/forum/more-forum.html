These caravans carried goods the way trucks and               cargoes do nowadays, but more importantly they carried ideas. Goods,               in and of themselves, already can imply ideas. They can carry cultural               ideas or ideology. For example, the spread of Islamic Revelation               in desert regions cannot be explained otherwise, as it involved               an area ranging from the Hejaz to Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,               Central Asiaall being essentially nomadic lands, tribal populations.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The               crucial role of nomadism in the spreading of communications (before               the advent of the printing press) is duplicated today with the invention               and the use of electronic networks. The computer has turned the               world into the sustainer of myriads of communication lines where               thinking can spread out beyond the old system of printing and diffusing               ideas through books which are material objects, heavy and space               consuming. We have entered an era where things (meaning messages               and thoughts) move instantly, with no visible traces, thus fitting               a nomadic society which is more of a servicing society than an object               producing one. You cant carry libraries and files on camelback.               </font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The               emphasis, for ancient culture, was on memorization. Tribal societies               developed poetry at the expense of novels because the former was               easier to memorize, and because poetry is a more economical way               of thinking than other forms of literature. And the contemporary               world is moving in that same direction: the emphasis is made possible,               or facilitated, by computers. As the nomad carried his whole culture               in his head (usually a basic religious/legal &quot;book&quot; like               the Koran, the Bible, Asiatic wisdom books etc.), we are already               carrying in a small computer &quot;all the data we need,&quot; and               pretty soon &quot;all the literature or the knowledge we will want.&quot;</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Whole               societies nowadays are on the move in massive human tides. The panic               created in European countries in the face of immigration calls for               attention. The influx of refugees and job seekers represents something               more than just an economic phenomenon. It is a deeper stirring,               the kind of tidal waves that the Crusades were, or other great invasions               of the past. But this time there are no generals leading these migrations;               these are spontaneous, probably irrational, instinctive movements               of populations. Of course there are economic and political factors               concerning these migrations, but I think of deeper forces: the human               animal is both nomadic and sedentary, but technology, scientific               advances, explorations of outer space, have created an environment,               both psychic and intellectual, which stimulates, favors, the nomadic,               over the conservative, sedentary instincts of humans.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The               electronic age is about movement: the simultaneous transmission               of (written) thought through e-mail, following the transmission               of the spoken through radio and telephone, has loosened the maximum               boundaries of the book. Objects containing thoughts, such as books,               documents, letters, etc., see their role minimized in this new context.               The audience is not limited anymore; thinking is, so to speak, thrown               to the winds. This globalization of ones audience reminds us, strangely,               of the great imperial periods of History.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In               this worldwide feeling of uncertainty some things are certain: on               the one hand the mobility of goods and capital is pushed to its               extremes, meanwhile the mobility of people is seen as a threat and               is being contained (as much as possible). Traditional cultures are               breaking down under globalization of objects and <i>ideas</i>, ideas               represented not only in books but also through all the arts and               architecture, under the power of the web which is a real web. It               is as if the world has become a huge spider whose head is nowhere               to be seen and its threads create a mesh, which encompasses the               whole of the planet.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This               <i>mondialisation </i>of practically everything creates its antidote:               we cannot go back to the tightly closed nation-states, but are heading               towards a new kind of tribalism: the world is breaking down (in               a most fluid way), into &quot;groups,&quot; &quot;cultural organizations,&quot;               &quot;communities,&quot; which are not linked by cultural space               but by a common &quot;network.&quot; All of this is made possible               by the computer age. In that sense our real neighbor does not inhabit               the same street, but rather a similar electronic address. Our audience               is not in the same room, but in front of the same electronic page,               so that all the groups, some of them overlapping, the societies,               the leagues, the networks and associations, organizations, political               parties, to which we increasingly belong, become tribes of a new               kind which gather periodically and disperse, each member joining               other tribes, and this ad infinitum.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Welcome               to How2, one of your tribes!</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>BIO:               </b>Etel Adnan came to this country to do a masters in Philosophy               at Berkeley, then moved on to Harvard.

Sound's role in media-like radio and cinema not               only caused shifts in oral communication and methods of montage,               but came to play an important role in the ways that these media               reconfigured spatial representation and perception. As the global               communications network becomes an increasingly online flow, the               internet inherits a rhetoric of remote communication and spatial               contamination first nourished by early radio work. And as digitized               images, both still and moving, proliferate in the visual frame of               the browser, we might begin to wonder how cinema's model of audio-vision               can be understood in its relationship to the online experience.               As readers of hypertext, the principle structuring and orientating               motor in cyberspace, how can we understand the relevance of sound               to the predominantly silent online digital space that harbors both               rhetorical and formal elements of radio and film?</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hypertext               makes no noise. Whatever spatial imaginary it is that hypertext               activates, urban or otherwise, it excludes the acoustic dimension.               The silence online resembles nothing more than the outer-spatial               silence of a vacuum. There is no murmur in the distance to suggest               isolation; there is no room-tone as in film; there is no sonic signal               interference--cosmic or terrestrial--as in radio. In fact, the bleeps               and escalating rush of static accompanying log-on have an opposite               meaning to similar noises in radio. What once characterized the               informational <i>informe</i> has now become a sign of connectivity               and access. The log-on noise is a rush of bits, an accelerating               flow immersing the user in a new data-sphere, and resembles nothing               so much as a space shuttle's noisy departure from the atmosphere               and entry into the silence of a vacuum.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Older               media like radio, film, and television all had specific acoustic               characters owing to their accommodation of noise as a data-background.               The impurity of sound in these media and the distinction between               synchronous and asynchronous sound allowed for a figure-ground relationship               where the sonic content of a broadcast, program, or montage leapt               forward against a backdrop of interference or ambience, performing               as a powerful organizer of the spatial imaginary.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How               can sound resonate in the transphysical city of language? At this               point, it is difficult to imagine navigation by sonar online. Hyper-sound               is still a slippery and dissonant concept. The streaming sound currently               available online has a compressed and fractured character. Audio               streams and net radio are tapped much as faucets are opened. Real-time               online audio continues to remind us of the hard-wires piping information               to any online terminal. That is precisely why the term "net.radio"               always rings with a note of irony: the airwaves have been brought               back down to earth.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hypertext               and streaming sound are configuring cyber-space in almost opposite               ways. While hypertext mobilizes the spatial imaginary into a sense               of virtual urbanism, streaming sound, crushed into a low-resolution               format and grounded to the physical network of telephony, returns               the user to a base-physicality. Online sound does not yet inscribe               virtual space but is itself inscribed by the technological conditions               of that space. Cyber-space has already developed as a predominantly               visual lattice of text and image, and will continue to do so for               some time before acquiring an integrated acoustic dimension. It               remains to be seen what artifacts the current infancy of online               sound will bring to the expanding optical landscape already online.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Bio:               </b></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Michael               Floyd graduated from Princeton University in 1999.

Since its debut               over five years ago, there has been a consistent and ongoing attempt               to define the Web and hypertext media as likened to something that               we already understand and with which we feel safe, like print media.               In parallel, there is the related challenge of reconciling hypertext               media with the tangibility of print because of its inability to               exist outside of the box; questioning our relationship to the physical               and the placement of value on the material. At the center of these               dialogues is a knowledge that the Web is both of these: similar               to print publishing mediums in its presentation of information,               but vastly different in its seemingly indefinable and intangible               limitlessness of dimensionality.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One               of the most satisfying hypertext experiences for me occurred while               I was an undergraduate, before any commercialization of the Web,               in a course dedicated to the plays of William Shakespeare. Each               evening as I poured through the pages of another tragedy, comedy,               or history, in my "Complete Penguin Shakespeare," my left index               finder navigating the body text and my right index finger at the               bottom of the page navigating the corresponding footnotes, I reveled               in the immediacy of related texts, relational topics, and literary               dimensionality. Now, almost fifteen years later and as the publisher               of an online poetry journal, I find that the hypertext medium offers               an even greater opportunity in demonstrated correspondence including               visual, audio, and heightened textual dimensionality. Within this               capacity, ideas may locate themselves within a spatial atmosphere               defying the physical laws of place and thus opening to the possibility               for expanded and enhanced articulations. This is not to say that               print medium does not offer an equally engaging forum for invention               and discovery, but I would posit that hypertext provides a new and               different lattice for expression where the text is fused with an               infinite capacity for branching and relational spatiality.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Inherent               within this discourse of print and online media, difference and               devaluation are surprising companions where prejudice for the tangible               in print publishing tends toward marginalization of the Web as a               viable publishing medium. That despite the innovations of relational               correspondence, because online publication is often perceived as               simply a digital translation of print publication and devoid of               the material value of a physical thing, that it is less real,               and thus, less important. Difficulty arises in the effort to define               by association and a consequent devaluation in comparison. Thus,               in this like comparison, what becomes fundamentally at stake is               our general location of value on the material. Its not surprising               that in an attempt to understand the Web and hypertext media, that               one would look to the referential in order to approximate an understanding               of it. However, to accept the Web as a new and different publishing               medium, that does not challenge or devalue the print publishing               medium, but instead enhances it through qualities of likeness and               difference, is to open literary discourse to yet unarticulated possibilities               for dimensionally correspondent literary expression and understanding.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Bio:               </b>Raised in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, m. mara-ann is a San               Francisco based poet, Web developer, and publisher of <a href="http://www.medusa.org/wood/">http://www.medusa.org/wood/</a></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">               <i>WOOD</i>, an online journal published quarterly featuring collaborations               between poets and visual artists.

The making of meaning in cyberspace               rests heavily on this so-called reader, specifically in the relationships               among the texts she chooses -- out of which the she must make her               own particular sense. It is perhaps for this reason that the word               &quot;user&quot; is sometimes substituted for &quot;reader.&quot;</font></p>            <p ></p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;Using&quot;               may be a more appropriate term for what one does in cyberspace anyway.               One reason is the relative youth of the media itself. As Marshall               McLuhan explains, we have so internalized the apparatus of print               (turning pages; silently reading, line by line, a physically homogenous               text) that the technology has taken on a kind of &quot;transparency,&quot;               whereby we do not &quot;see&quot; a book as a technology per se.               The heterogeneity and visual non-uniformity of some hypertext can               prevent one from achieving the kind of direct, physically dis-associative               communication that print media has come to enable. Michael Joyce               puts it succinctly when he writes, &quot;text on the screen is <i>conspicuously               </i>non-print&quot;<b> </b><kbd><a href="#2">(2)</a></kbd> <a name="fn2"></a>Accordingly,               where one must actively <i>use</i> relatively unfamiliar apparatus               (keyboard, monitor, mouse) to engage with hypertext, &quot;reading&quot;               is again not quite an accurate term. One is reminded, also, that               &quot;user&quot; suggests a very different relationship to text               than does &quot;reader.&quot; A relationship, I think, which is               infused with a strong sense of consumerism.</font></p>            <p></p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While               the kind of sense the reader makes in cyberspace may be aggressively               mediated by the literal aspects of the computer terminal, the sources               of the information one reads (or uses) may be less mediated in that               they need not necessarily be processed by publishers, editors, corporate               interests, etc. This is of course untrue of plenty of sites (including               How2), whose hierarchies operate similarly to that of a print publication.               Nonetheless, for those with access to the equipment, self-publishing               and access to self-published work has never been easier, and certain               levels of corporate mediation, at least, may be bypassed.</font></p>            <p></p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Joshua               Meyrowitz has argued (of television) that unprecedented access to               information, the specificities of the world outside, the &quot;private&quot;               lives of other people, has eroded our &quot;sense of place.&quot;               <kbd><a href="#3">(3)</a> </kbd> <a name="fn3"></a>Meyrowitzs idea               seems especially relevant to cyberspace, where the parameters of               social geography are mental (or technological). In a realm where               the idea of place is even less stable than in those of other media,               it becomes tricky to &quot;locate&quot; ourselves in the old sense               of identification with either a physical or an ideological position.               But there may be other possibilities, ways more suited to the medium.</font></p>            <p></p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Marcos               Novak writes, &quot;I combine words and occupy places that are the               consequences of my words.&quot; <a href="#4"><kbd>(4)</kbd></a>               <a name="fn4"></a>But this is perhaps only fully true if one completely               understands the structures one is working with and within. Once,               information was external to a reader; now, when we use the web,               we say we are &quot;in&quot; the information -- or &quot;on&quot;               it, implying that we can stay afloat on (even surf!) this vast sea               by using our &quot;navigator&quot; to make our chosen connections.               The threat of consumption is palpable, especially to one not trained               in computer science. The temptation to respond reflexively by consuming               can be powerful.</font></p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In               cyberspace, as in real life, one must choose &quot;locations,&quot;               sites for ones selves to reside. But in the context of Wendys               question, we cannot simply locate ourselves &quot;as readers and               writers,&quot; because, in a textually based cyberspace, everyone               is a reader, a writer, or both. And we cannot claim to locate ourselves               in identity because the very idea of the unitary self has been weakened               or undermined by postcolonial and feminist theories (among others)               and even by the processes of cyberspace. As Judith Butler and others               have exposed the social construction of gender, post-colonial studies               has insisted upon a notion of &quot;individual subjectivity that               is defined in terms of multiple subject positions&quot; <a href="#5"><kbd>(5)</kbd></a>               <a name="fn5"></a>based on experiences of migration, mimicry, and               crises of cultural identity. Both point to a mutable, decentered               subject, one which resembles Donna Harraways well known &quot;cyborg.&quot;               <kbd><a href="#6">(6)</a></kbd> <a name="fn6"></a>Haraway argues               that communications and biotechnology reduce bodies (bodies of knowledge               and corporeal bodies) to coding, which are then subject to disassembling,               reconstruction, and transformation. The techno-body brings about               a new subjectivity (the cyborg), which takes for granted the erosion               of boundaries between body and machine. If we accept these ideas               on subjectivity, our means of location must then be flexible, multiple,               and able to simultaneously encompass many variables. I would like               to suggest that we try to &quot;locate&quot; our places on the web               in terms of consumption and production. Not by declaring, &quot;I               am a consumer&quot; or &quot;I am a producer,&quot; but in action.               For example, I locate my connection to feminism as a historically               based position from which I act rather than a &quot;natural&quot;               connection to an essential womanhood. Analogously, I hope to locate               myself in cyberspace as one of the producers of its structures.               And in doing so, if I recognize Harraways manifesto, I locate myself               <i>as </i>one of those structures. But unlike in the physical world,               where &quot;structure&quot; implies rigidity, the structural &quot;locations&quot;               I imagine remain in flux. When my piece of the structure disappears,               another takes its place. And in this I can remain always flexible,               and do not recognize inherent hierarchical positions (such as those               associated with print text) because any given location equals any               other. </font></p>            <p></p>            <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>As               a writer</b></font></p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The               next step then, it seems, is to locate oneself as a writer.

This is my response               to Wendys final question about the &quot;trans-physical city of               language.&quot; It is a stunningly beautiful idea, but one that               doesnt seem likely as more and more hypertext writings are only               available on CDROM (through such companies as Eastgate), <kbd><a href="#7">(7)</a></kbd>               <a name="fn7"></a>and access to sites is controlled internally by               tagging and meta-tagging; externally, by the threat of censorship,               either legislative or local (e.g. bosses, parents); and economically,               by access to computer knowledge and equipment (not to mention the               &quot;free&quot; [non-earning] time it takes to create). </font>             </p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The               idea that the audience helps construct the text is not particular               to hypertext (Derrida wrote it; so did Shakespeare).

Since               I am a newcomer to hypertext, those aspects that interest me are               relatively basic. At the most obvious level, hypertext can engage               multiple senses, allowing image, sound, and even touch to emerge               from or interact with or morph into or from text. </font></p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Secondly,               the sense of parallel and perpendicular universes in the vast network               of cyberspace imparts a feeling of profound interconnectedness,               a &quot;holistic&quot; approach to text which might begin to subvert               the Romantic notion of the isolated, subjective artist. </font></p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Related               to this, cyberspace may help enable the deconstruction of the authority               of presence, and therefore undermine hierarchies based on body or               location in the physical world. In cyberspace, any presence is potentially               tenuous, prone to (or even dependent upon) trickster shape-changing               and transformation. There can be no claims to &quot;natural&quot;               or even identity-based authority where nothing &quot;is&quot; but               only &quot;seems.&quot; This can bring a delightful playfulness               to hypertext writing, even as it may precipitate a serious crisis               regarding what-is-to-be-believed. </font></p>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And               in a space of subverted authority and nonlinear time (in that many               worlds [realms - representations] of &quot;time&quot; may run simultaneously               in cyberspace), what is the place of memory? What can we call memory               if seeming is being?

The visual and hypertextual form of this &quot;Ballad&quot;               (http://www.wordcircuits.com/gallery/sandsoot/) explores the varying               boundary between them in structural and visual ways that exceed               the line patterning found in the printed text on the <i>Boston Review               </i>website. </font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Old               habits of reading are more readily accommodated by the &quot;Ballad&quot;               than by &quot;Genesis&quot;: it is a person, not a bacterium, doing               &quot;interpretation&quot;; but Im not sure either work writes               &quot;with places,&quot; as opposed to &quot;transitions&quot; or,               perhaps, &quot;relationships.&quot; Space does open up, perhaps               monstrously, to a world of currents and translations. We dont see               these spaces full so much as feel them fill. We dont watch them               perform; we perform them, in part, in connection with others, in               processes of conjugal transfer that propagate themselves.</font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>BIO:               </b>Stephanie Stricklands &quot;Ballad of Sand and Harry Soot&quot;               won the 1999 <i>Boston Review </i>prize.
