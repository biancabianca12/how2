And woman. A moment of incipience. Krukowska         is kneeling before a silver foil oven tray filled with water. A light         falls on the water&#146;s surface. The movement of the water is reflected         by the light. Krukowska&#146;s wearing black like the stage that surrounds         her. She moves, and in moving she moves the light. Slowly and quietly.         <i>(inaudible lapping is language for you) </i> I wait because I know         it&#146;s coming. I hold my breath because it is too quiet and I&#146;m         making too much noise.

(<i>indistinct and marking the moment of its lapping</i>) Oh.         She moves out of the light. Slowly and so that it veils her, and leaves,         but briefly, space for her eyes.</font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There         are two acts. And doesn&#146;t coming yearn for an arrival? Krukowska         leaves the water in its place on the stage. It has exceeded its foil tray.         She stands now behind a pane of glass hanging from the ceiling by two         loops of string. By a thread. It&#146;s still dark dark stills it. She         moves around the glass, is reflected in the glass (it&#146;s a mirror         not a window), sees through the glass (it&#146;s a window not a mirror),         leans on it, is dissected by it. Slowly. Then, enter a man. (It is always         a man but not always the same man, it is the man of the moment). </font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">He         stands close to her but they are separated by the glass. Face to face.<i>         </i>She moves close to him across the glass. Krukowska then crouches under         the glass and in one definable movement pushes it up with her shoulders         and stands so that it rests on his shoulders. So that the glass sinks         into the flesh of his neck. Both rest their hands at their sides. I hear,         and listen to, the man breathe although I don&#146;t dare to myself. They         have flicked off the thread and support the glass between them. They move         simultaneously but they are not the same form. They kneel with the glass         between them. Ah. It is unbearable. The glass smashes &#150; dropped from         two feet above the floor.

I flinch, I gasp, I smile, I sigh,         then I resume normal breath. I am trying to remember how. The man goes         back to his seat in the audience. <i>(has the one who has left disappeared         completely)</i> There is momentary pleasure in release. <i>(a fervour         runs through the limbs aching)</i></font></p>      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>the         way of little red riding hood</i></font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">by         way of spilling and breaking, in the wake of water and smashed glass Krukowska         moves stage left, pausing to drink in the dark. In the light, now, a square         of white sheet on the floor (about four metres squared), weighted with         a rock centre front. In the centre stands an empty glass goblet. Entering         this white space Krukowska walks to the goblet in bare feet over the sheet,         takes the glass in both hands and slowly releases from her mouth a stream         of red liquid. She fills the glass. <i>(a trickling of warm blood, indistinct         and marking the moment of its lapping)</i> She replaces the glass (the         sacrament &#150; from the vine / from the body of a woman) in the centre         and walks forward to the left front corner of the sheet, and sits, feet         apart placed sole down before her. She picks up a thread of white cotton         we had not seen, and begins to sew, wide stitches that bind her foot to         the sheet. Slow and deliberate and utterly silent. And the other foot.         She stands bound, lifts one foot then the other, from the edge she disturbs         the centre, testing the limit but bound to (by) the margin.

She stands. A disturbance, a ripple, her movement         is confined / defined by her relation to the ground beneath her. The glass         and the rock remain. <i>(the lapping of warm blood flowing through the         vessels)</i> She breaks the thread and moves to the rear of her space,         and sits at the left corner limit.</font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This         slow silence is excruciating &#150; I do not know where we are going,         I do not know the way.
