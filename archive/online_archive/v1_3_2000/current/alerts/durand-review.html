Its essential to have books         like <i> &Uuml;L: Four Mapuche</i> Poet<i>s: Elicura Chihuailaf, Leonel         Lienlaf, Jaime Luis Huen&uacute;n, Graciela Huinao</i>, edited by Cecilia         Vicu&ntilde;a and translated by John Bierhorst, poke into its isolated         existence. The poems are translated from Mapudungun to Spanish to English,         and translated from oral expression to inscription on the page. Even these         filtered and &quot;frozen&quot; (the word Mapuche poet Leonel Lienlaf         uses to describe the printed versions of his poems) poems have the power         to highlight the limitations and possibilities of ones own language as         a communal expression and shaper of perception. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the introductory         biography/artists statement for Lienlaf, Vicu&ntilde;a says: &quot;One         look at the Mapudungun suggests Lienlafs mastery of the language. One         or two words, in some cases, convey the entire meaning of a line, where         the corresponding Spanish needs a full phrase.&quot;On reading Lienlafs         &quot;Rebirth,&quot; I felt the same thrill as when I first discovered         that the Hopi language has an enormous range of verb tenses that go far         beyond Englishs simple past/present/future conjugations. Such translations         are the evidence that the inarticulate (including disenfranchised, disputed,         disrupted experience) can be articulated, that the way English is formulated         is not necessarily the only way that experience can be expressed. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;<i>Rebirth</i>&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My soul         is confused<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">with         the earth<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">as         it brightens and</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">flowers.<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Flowering         soul.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;<i>Renacimiento</i>&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Se confunde         mi espiritu<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">cuando         se alegra<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">y         florece con la tierra.<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Espiritu         florido.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;<i>Rayen         P&uuml;lli</i>&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Adngelay<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">rainmew<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">mapumew<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&ntilde;i         p&uuml;lli,<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">rayen         p&uuml;lli.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Mapuche         are the original inhabitants of &quot;Chile,&quot; (a name which Vicu&ntilde;a         calls &quot;superimposed on a territory already named by antecedent peoples&quot;).         As recently as 1979, a law was declared &quot;abolishing communal ownership         of the land and even the definition of Mapuche culture as a way of life         with a name of its own.&quot; This &quot;genocidal law&quot; sparked a         political movement that &quot;seeks to recover both the land base and         cultural rights,&quot; and provoked an upsurge or &quot;pill&aacute;n&quot; in         the public expression of Mapuche poetry, with public performances and         publications devoted to it.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Both Vicu&ntilde;a         and Lienlaf tell us that the oral expression of this poetry is essential         to its existence; that &quot;our creativity is more properly experiential.         In Chilean society, by contrast, the need for expression is channeled         into writing, because there you do not have the interlocutors with whom         poetry can be developed ... When you print Mapudungun on a piece of paper         it becomes frozen, as though it had been startled, keeping the words from         finding their bearing. Orality lets you adjust the meaning; writing does         not.&quot; And the poem, in oral expression, becomes an essential part         of establishing contact with the community (in direct opposition to the         1979 law).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Much of         the poetry presents the intricacies of being a Mapuche, an act that has         been and is dangerous and complex in the face of societal and governmental         repression. Graciela Huinao recalls that even though her father spoke         to her in tse dungun (a version of Mapudungun), she responded in Spanish.         &quot;I would hear him sing in the native language. How I would love to         have learned it! But if I could speak it, how would I write it? In what         alphabet?&quot; And as a woman, her situation is even more complex, as         &quot;the first woman to take up the pen in a family line of women who         were abducted and raped.&quot; Its exhilarating then, to read her all-capitalized         &quot;shouts,&quot; a headfirst way to break thru that double silence:</font></p>      <p align="CENTER"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">MY         FATHERS VOICE<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">IN         UNTAMED LANGUAGE<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">MY         VERSES ARE BORN<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">OF         THE PROLONGED<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">NIGHT         OF THE EXTERMINATION</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">or</font></p>      <p align="CENTER"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">PSALM         1492<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>to         the Guarani people</i><br>        </font></p>      <p align="CENTER"></p>      <p align="CENTER"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THOUGH         WE WERE NEVER<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THE         CHOSEN PEOPLE<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THEY         CHOSE TO KILL US<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">IN         THE NAME OF THE CROSS</font></p>      <p align="CENTER"></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In a common         practice very much ongoing, land is taken from native populations and         stripped in particularly evil ways (i.e. gold mining in Papua New Guinea).         Chile is no exception. And this destruction is very much linked to the         destruction of language--like the loss of the original meaning of place-names         which gave human continuity and depth to a place. As Vicu&ntilde;a says in her         introduction, &quot;There is no memory of the old art of naming, and nobody         today reads place of the female condor in the name Manquehue, or pain         in the name of the hill Huelen, the Cerro Santa Lucia, in the center of         Santiago.&quot; Chihuailaf in a paired set of poems expresses this geographical         duality of loss: the ones who named the land are now strangers within         the lands political and social system. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;Things         Turn Out Astoundingly in the Countryside&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And at times         there is nothing, I tell them.

Lienlaf: &quot;My hand would         not write/what wasnt my own/He said to me:/You must be the rising silence.//My         hand/told me the world/could not be written.&quot; But it must, and Lienlaf,         along with his three comrades, does. The disappearance of a language limits         the ways one can think, the ability to conceive of alternatives--different         ways of thinking are lost. Verb tenses, history, mythology, perception:         limited, blank, void. This book wedges that closing door back open.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>BIO</b>:         Marcella Durand is the author of <i>City of Ports</i> (Situations Press),         the Program Coordinator for the Poetry Project, and the poetry editor         for Erato Press.
