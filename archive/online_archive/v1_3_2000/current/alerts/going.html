It could serve as an epigraph for the book. Koanically odd, the         lines at first seem untrue, like the statements in logic exams where one         must circle the word which doesn&#146;t fit, this is to that as that is         to this: humans and fowl have no gills, are any but human seeking? But         I&#146;d flunk -- a fowl&#146;s wattle is its gill, a human&#146;s, the         loose skin under the chin. And yes, I&#146;ll concede, having read <i>Human         Forest</i>&#150;all seeking. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Newman&#146;s         first book, <i>The Blood Flower</i> (Em Press), was a catechism of erotic         origins. &quot;Of Later Things Yet to Happen&quot; is a Book of Hours,         each of its twenty-four poems titled for an hour of the day -- and the         whole of <i>Human Forest</i> is a Book of Questions. A confluence of spiritual         seeking and erotic desire --&quot;All potential has its erotic push/bound         to it -- blood yolk/with an ocean source&quot;&#150;Newman&#146;s poems         are full of inquiry, a momentum of dialogue and discourse and quest hastening         towards &quot;its future nature,&quot; while at the same time flaying         layers to return to that source. &quot;You see lines are not horizontal         but lead the eye down on a switch-back/descent of unraveling&#133;.&quot;         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Her erotic         ancestors include the nereid. &quot;Beneath apparent life sought fish         oblivion muck bottom/sinking in it/girl who swims well swims down/inhales.&quot;         The sought spiritual/erotic source and destination are the same, &quot;imprecisely         that which the two would be&#133;rolling sea water without rupture such         as inquiry.&quot; To be human is to be &quot;One part want/one part memory/all         of it a loan.&quot; And a koan. As Newman states it in the short poem,         &quot;Now&quot; (one possible response to the koanic longing, &quot;If         only we had moments between moments to choose them&quot; in &quot;Of Later         Things Yet to Happen&quot;), &quot;the mind turns backward/recalls a sea/the         body rests in its cave/and the sea goes nowhere.&quot; </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To seek&#150;to         desire&#150;is to ask. Newman&#146;s first query is &quot;Animal, vegetable,         or mineral?&quot; and her answer is &quot;Yes.&quot; As in a dream where         the dreamer is represented in each of its elements, Newman&#146;s identifications         of the human float among the animal, vegetable, mineral and the four or         five elements. The human is forest, is fish, is fowl, is vegetable decay         and matter, is water, is mud, is stone, is star. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When she         writes,&quot;You could be a star/You could be someone --,&quot; &quot;Already         in the big sky travelers/are floating lights/each with a window asking/is         this it?&quot; (&quot;Why Pear?&quot;), the reference to fame is only         secondary or tertiary to a more literal, elemental, aerial reference.         &quot;Give us that perfectly/eluding all and earth bird/talent&quot; (&quot;Why         Pear?&quot;).

Yet the clarity of her hermetic verse,         a kind of delicacy and plainness of space and breath and speech, often         seems most like fragments of Sappho, in a third-generation xerox, blown         up and nearly empty. Here are some poem-shards from &quot;Why Pear?&quot;:         &quot;a Greek god tourist in photocopied love time&#133; &quot;but they         look so real&quot;&#133;He is fake&#133;Camouflaged as a person/anyone&#133;         Twice-born god&#133;in a boat/on a plate/chipped and cracked&#133;No warranty&#133;As         is, I&#146;d been saying/as is, is as, as is.&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;Is         as&quot; is metaphor, not origin. As is, with no warranty -- its meaning         worn, chipped and cracked -- in a boat on a plate not at all the same         sea-ride. Is the original available in language, or is all language worn         metaphor? Is questioning -- idea -- by its nature derivative? &quot;and         they complain:/can nothing handed down save us&quot; (&quot;Of Later Things         Yet To Happen&quot;). &quot;but they look so real&quot; is the only conversation         in &quot;Why Pear?&quot; that rates quotation marks, emphasizing the fake,         second-hand quality of talk. Is language itself &quot;Some Extra Thing&quot;?         &quot;What if every wisp of nature, each rock, dandelion, oak/were dressed?         as though it were&#150;/our saying: igneous, weed, live oak&#133;&quot;         (&quot;Some Extra Thing&quot;).
