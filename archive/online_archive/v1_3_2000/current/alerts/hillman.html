Brenda Hillman</font> </p>      <p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Lately it         has seemed doubly impressive to see young women poets writing in inventive         forms even as they join the conversation called Literary Criticism.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In structures         that comprise a kind of synaesthesia of genres, crossing sensuously over,         mixing purely poetic enterprise with analytic writing, they work against         expectation with a detached curiosity that brings fresh sanity from dreamed         forms.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In her         perceptively iconoclastic chapbook, <i>Spiderwasp or Literary Criticism</i>         (Spectacular Books, 1998) Juliana Spahr demonstrates what she admires,         summoning irreverent metaphors and spatially inventive shapes to re-consider         certain literary texts as acts of joining and received histories.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Expressing         impatience with clear-cut aesthetic categories (Language poetry, beat         generation, New York school) and eager to energize the reading process         in light of what has happened, she makes subtle analogies between reading,         writing, being fed, being fed upon, between critics and predators, poets         and prey, critics and prey, poets and predators.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         metaphor of the spiderwasp is brilliant precisely because it reexamines         the terms of metaphor and belief in metaphor while using metaphor.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Her         analogies aren't strict alignments and do not give way to more drastic         separatism.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;On the         right side of the booklet, Spahr makes a rational account of specific         texts by women that interest her, positing that their relation to the         literary moments that precede them is neither strict nor irrelevant.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;On the         left the broken story of a couple of insects: a pepsis wasp that must         lay its eggs in the body of a tarantula.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Noting         that literary movements often establish themselves by "divide and separate"         moments Spahr recalls the importance of anthologies (Allen, 1960 and Silliman,         1986) and speeches (Grenier, 1971) and reads them as important for their         time while acknowledging the tendency of discrete moments to "literalize         the name avant-garde."</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;"These         separations are partially true and partially false," she writes, as she         calls into question all sorts of categories. Even he and she, right and         left.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Spahr         undertakes a passionate and compassionate examination of how moments of         avant-garde literary history are reworked in a few texts by women: Lisa         Jarnot's <i>Sea Lyrics</i>, Jena Osman's "The Periodic Table as Assembled         by Dr. Zhivago, Occultist," and Joan Retallack's <i>The Blue Stares</i>.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;On each         left page of the chapbook (one thinks of the analog of having the "original         language" from a translation on the left) the non-story/ story metaphor/non-metaphor         unfolds of a spider and a wasp, a man and a woman, capitalist economy         and a social life.</font></p>      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;She         sets three kinds of discourse side by side on the two pages: metaphoric         prose poetry//critical analysis//footnote. The three forms can be read         horizontally as individual languages, establishing their </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">relationships         across in a spatially vivid way.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In the         main drama/metaphor on the left (the poem) the wasp waits to ambush and         feed off a tarantula. Spahr keeps her tone steady as she describes this.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;A subplot         to this side plot is the drama of someone coming home "with spider bites"         about to read and to confess to/as forms of betrayal. In this manner,         she subverts the nest while showing the naturalness of nest itself. Italicized         subtitles ("the story unfolds," "everything has flipped") give a clue         to the portent of the drama in witty terms of nineteenth century melodrama.         The couple has suffered some confusion in their relationship that is deeply         personal and extends to their reading practices.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         drama is never clearly defined. The couple refuse to tell the story "straight"         and the narrator does also, for to do so would be to participate in isolating         falsehoods The only hope for them is in the fragmented, somewhat alienating         telling that is not without beauty and not without grotesque amusement.</font></p>      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Neither         complete fragment nor complete discontinuity is accurate. Only both are         accurate.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Gender         is important and unimportant in the account. Boundaries are questioned         when the principal actors are called "he or she." Plot is made nervous         by the widely spaced lines.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;As Spahr         extends her critical attention through the works of Jarnot, Osman, and         Retallack, she develops the metaphor/story so that it is at once more         gripping and more fractured.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Ownership,         territoriality and the ideas of an "individual work" are called into question         in Spahr's form of literary criticism, though she never denies the obvious         truth that poetic practices emerge in context of other practices. She         never claims that Jarnot, Osman, and Retallack exist as isolated forces,         but she honors the unique bodies of their work.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;She         can implicate herself wittily as well, as critic as wasp re-visited--         while engaging in acts of poetic remaking.</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         reader can choose to read all the left pages, all the right pages, some         of each and both together. The eye is delightedly drawn both to the individual         pieces Spahr illuminates-- Osman, Jarnot and Retallack's-- and to this         synthesizing action that makes of reviewing other texts and poetic criticism         a new animal.</font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">BIO</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">:</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">         Brenda Hillman has published two chapbooks, the most recent of which is         <i>Autumn Sojourn</i> (Em Press, 1995) and five books (all from Wesleyan         University Press) most recently <i>Loose Sugar</i> (1997).
