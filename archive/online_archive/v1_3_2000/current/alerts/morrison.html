Treadwell has the ability         to create a non-hierarchical page teeming with pasts and presents without         compromising her characteristic sharpness of wit and depth of insight.         Treadwell&#146;s writing creates an unusually democratic space within         which all her materials are equally exploited, adored, tried on, subverted         and ultimately employed toward a fresh, reinvigorated feminist methodology         that for all its volume is no less feisty, no less active, just better         armed.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Populace</i>         unfolds with charming frankness and agility. In &quot;The Anglican Church         at Port Louise,&quot; Treadwell skates fluidly through a two page piece         which includes, watching Mutual of Omaha&#146;s Wild Kingdom on the floor         with dad, the story of a Brit. challenging an African custom and losing         his mind in the process, sitting in a sexy dress, listening to her boyfriend         rehearse and reflecting on Americans, an account of Black Elk and Buffalo         Bill, an encounter with a snotty movie star who hasn&#146;t heard of &quot;Bay         Watch&quot;, and a story of Baboons invading a picnic, finishing up with         &quot;why the hell don&#146;t I just shut the fuck up.&quot; (p.44-46)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like many         of us, much of the acute, unrelenting language of <i>Populace</i> is locked         into a perpetual adolescence, filled with bravado, insecurity and horror         &quot;on the stylized school stoop, forever&#133;&quot; (p. 67). In <i>Populace</i>,         this is an adolescence which refuses nostalgia or self-pity but reveals         a keen awareness, an urgent self-loathing that keeps both text and reader         edgy, alert.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At a time         when many emergent experimental writers are creating, for lack of a better         label, a post-post-structuralist writing that challenges conventional         modes of narration but does not reject narrative all together, Treadwell&#146;s         work appeals to those who consider themselves within the lineage of language         writing and those who prefer the New Narrative of such innovators as Bob         Gluck and Dodie Bellamy. Without changing hats Treadwell writes &quot;prose         poetry, poetry and stories,&quot; and in so doing maximizes the various         formal aspects of her writing as they operate within the diminishing specificity         of each genre. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In <i>Populace         </i>there exists an awareness of narrative as both a violence and a mechanism         for survival. The peopled local histories reveal familiar names and faces,         buildings and geographies, simultaneously creating an intimacy and an         exclusion. For Treadwell, a garbled narrative is more than an attempt         to mirror the lived experience of childhood trauma in a time when fragmented         subjectivity is often taken for granted. Her narrative impulse becomes         not so much an attempt to re-build or invent a stable self per se, but         rather a desire to create a feminine/feminist text that is viable, multi-dimensional,         accessible and publicly private. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Whoever/whatever         she/it/the text is (riot girl grown up? Professor Hello Kitty in combat         boots?), it seizes the hard won insights of earlier feminist cultural         and literary production, grapples with the consumer capitalist America         within which it resides and creates an intelligent, complex, and <i>active</i>         agent. The political potential of Treadwell&#146;s work is that she continues         to express, both in terms of style and content, some of the core contemporary         contradictions of female subjectivity.</font></p>      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;In         the daylight let her stumble, allow her to speak.&quot;<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Syrup&quot;         (p. 62) </font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Times"><b><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">BIO</font></b><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">:         Yedda Morrison lives in San Francisco where she co-edits <i>Tripwire,         a Journal of Poetics</i>.
