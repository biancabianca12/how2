An impressive book, <i>The         Character</i> was the winner of the 1998 Barnard New Women Poets Prize.         In recent years, this prize has published increasingly fascinating first         books which emphasize intelligent innovations in poetry.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;<i>The         Character</i>, among other things, is an exploration of aesthetic terminology,         genre constructions, categories, limitations and philosophical systems.         It examines the nature of "character" seen through different players,         those who deem that language become &quot;detached/attached&quot; and         those who &quot;promote transparency of emotion.&quot; Osman asks (through         the voice of one of her characters?) "might a sort of passivity/agitate         action?" while herself playing "the author of himself's complication".         Author can be instigator here, actor, author and designer of theater.         This active text is unafraid of boundaries and questions all kinds of         limitations: "Routine is a mechanism of locks/as caused by metal" and         "The/lights are gold as is the liquid/inside the vial" ("One: In the fields").         Containers or "Figural Cabinets" are analyzed for their contents: "he         was the heart of the machine/and believed in glass to enclose the inner         working/and to render him 'noiseless'" and "see hear marvel/in accordance         with a space closed in" ("Upbringing"). Poetic language embraces scientific:         "tines/as/fingers/in the play that exhibits them/as articles up for auction/or         are they simply bones/a small set of vertebrae around my wrist/caught         up in representing something finer/shinier". The inner mechanisms generate         their forms, are their forms: "a biological sphere connected to a radius/portrayed         by a particular motion."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Some         of the most interesting examinations look at the outcome of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E         poetry become <i>language</i> as <i>science</i>. "From The Periodic Table         As Assembled by Dr. Zhivago, Oculist&quot; is an exciting, interactive         poem of charts, tables, and scientific and literary terminology; it is         an alchemical wonder:</font></p>      <dir><dir><p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;<b>Isomorphs         for Iodine</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;once         a violet form in chloroform</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">a man steps         into geometry</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">dissolves         readily as medicine</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">did you see         the math</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">of his nature?</font></p></dir></dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The periodic         table heats language to its boiling point; transforms the elemental into         poetry. Magnesium, Calcium, Barium, Radium are part of a chemical process         of "bodies," "their shadows," our "partial knowledge," our "sight." Osman         writes: "Hieroglyphs relative to periodic elements, relative to caricature."         If postmodernism reduces language to signs, Osman shows us a navigational         system which revels in those signs. Like <i>The Character</i>, these poems         turn on questions of eye sight, on Heisenbergian principles, on Gloucester&#146;s         blind truths, and a fascination with the process of experimentation. Confident         in voice(s), it is a visual exploration of textual conventions, of sign         and forms in the arena of <i>play</i>.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Invoking         notions of theater, both Shakespearean and that of Satie,<i> </i>the architecture         of H.H. Richardson, Wilde's <i>Dorian Gray</i> and other textual "authorities,"         this book queries methods of <i>definition, hypothesis</i> and <i>observation</i>.         Osman's poems embrace modulation, change, the blurred limits of our knowledge.         They "assess how it is put together," challenge "intended/impressions,"         the "logic behind their construction" and as Lyn Hejinian writes in her         illuminating introduction, investigate "the power of invention." The poems         themselves are in the act of deconstructing and reconstructing, working         with lyric, prose, found texts, charts, footnotes and a sense of page         as <i>field</i> <i>of</i> <i>experiment</i>.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Several         poems in this collection investigate slippage: those dubious constructions         of "authority" and memory: the OED definition whose term is mistaken:         "'The OED says that geography is the autobiography of the earth. Or/ was         it geology?'" and those things become "unintelligible": "And yet it is         his unintelligibility that prevents him from finally being discarded"         Osman writes. Finally, <i>The Character</i> argues for experimentation         as action, as life itself. Questioning is both the method and the form;         conscious text the only living text:</font></p>      <dir><dir><p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&#9;He         does not account for a time where a man is forced to be dead text and         &#9;the others remain not so. He does not imagine a time where grace is         the stance of &#9;the beaten. The relation between action and life depends         on this.
