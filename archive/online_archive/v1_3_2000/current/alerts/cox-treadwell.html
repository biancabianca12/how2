I         tend to read narrative into everything, I'll admit, no matter how loose         or opposed. My question is: how does -- if it does, sometimes! -- the         layer ofautobiography (or passion/efficacy?) stand upon, within, or as         a disruption to the questions of language? At the How2 launch party, Bob         Gluck said something about a big emotion held (or did he say carried?)         by the tiniest iceberg&#150; of language, or of play. Or, of its construction.         And how does the writer and his/her story or the story he/she is making         up or retelling stand upon that precipice of language that is questioning         and deconstructing or at least decombobulating itself as it goes along?         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I found         this question answered and/or articulated again in the Martin, Schultz         and Levitsky books. Schultz in her knotty phraseologies and tightly wound         lines with a feeling of imminence/immanence; Martin in her sprung words         and loosely set "paragraphs" a traveler across page, geography,(perhaps         a) youth.... I was especially taken with Levitsky's strain of particular         humor (in all its definitions), a pop humor, some kind of genX (god help         me) thing I could (god help me again) relate to, which seemed the true         rather than the commercialized version. Forgive me, Rachel L., for perhaps         this is a sin. Sarah Anne, can you help me?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>SAC</b>:         I totally agree with you about the Schultz. I really got the feeling while         reading it that I was witnessing a struggle of someone trying to free         themselves of the too many words/too many turns of phrase/ too much said         in/of the world. It made me wonder if writing isn't just about expressing         the desire to speak what can't spoken. Schultz' book (and Martin's too)         reads as one long line with no place for you to stop or end. The words         are relentless as though they cannot stop themselves. It keeps coming         at you which makes it more anxious and less cozy than Levitsky's.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There is         something about it that really gives me the side arm elbow as in: You         are here in this diner, this party, this car, too. Which I think relates         to your comment about relating to the "genX"-ness of it. I like the way         her thinking about mapping expands. It feels like a journey, "They are         searching for the masculine- told it will reveal itself in odd numbers;"         That comes from the poem "Ithaka/Catorce" which I thought was brilliant.         So many openings and different ways of thinking about cartographies.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>ET</b>:         Along with my question is a worry and doubt in reading and writing that         the questioning of questioning of questioning of...ad, frankly, nauseum         (&amp; surely I'm guilty of it sometimes) of language-story-history-pursuit/objective/subjective         can be too present, overbearing itself and somehow static really then,         not moving. Also I think it can or may be important to bring in languages         that are not read languages, but heard languages, and to bring them in         not as objects but as sounds, not as landscape but as bridges....</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>SAC</b>:         Can there really be a poem or more say, a body of work that has no narrative         at all? It doesn't seem possible. It isn't necessarily autobiographical         but it is some kind of narrative however loosely you might define it.         And Clark's chapbook does present itself as an autobiography. It's very         simple, bare language, illustrated. I mean really illustrated with Walt         Disney drawings and designs. Here, the tension, the struggle, the question         isn't in the language story but in the relationship between the pictures         and the story. I'm thinking of the two facing pages with the dalmation         dots and the starry night dots. Or the double page where Bambi's mother         is whited out. "When I finally did see the movie, I was surprised at how         quickly the mother deer's death was forgotten...." It sounds almost absurd         to be saying this but there is a struggle to make some kind of new meaning         there that I really appreciated. Part of what makes this rather kitschy         subject acceptable is that while it is funny it's also kind of serious.         I felt there was some investment on the author's part. It was really interesting         to see a tracking like that of someone's relationship to a product or         whatever you want to call Walt Disney.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>ET</b>:         Which taken all together is an homage to the cinema of Walt Disney, a         history of a particular time to have a childhood (70s California), and         a thorough and funny and touching investigation into the construction         of knowledge and persona, and world (view). And it's about reading or         learning to read and her versions of Disney landscapes are central to         that -- she had the book but didn't get to see the movies. (My parents         never let me have Barbies, and now I'm so drawn to the messed up ones         at the Laney Flea Market.)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I'm really         interested in your comment on the tracking of someone's relationship to         a product (or whatever!). Part of what I know has irritated both of us         in some of &#145;our generation's&#146; (product placement??) writing         is the ambivalence to the world they try to bring in, so that it's not         quite brought in, because the writer seems to have no investment in or         feeling for the product or the story about alien abductions or whatever,         except in some sort of anthropological stance which I have come to find         frankly offensive.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>SAC</b>:         Me too. I think a lot of these books are constantly negotiating with the         outside voice. And that voice is kind of like a preexisting narrative         in myth, or in Walt Disney, or in histories. And this narrative has its         own language and is constantly imposing itself on the world. And that         language has brought things into being, has made truths. Part of the work         going on here it seems is finding a way to give these narratives new meanings         or rather new possibilities for meaning.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>ET</b>:         But somewhere in here I must mention Carol Mirakove's <i>Wall</i> in which         she's charmed me by titling one of her pieces "barrette" and its not merely         (demurely?) about cuteness, though that tendency has its place in her         register, which strikes me as legitimate. (Especially as it's one of the         languages that's deeply pressed upon/negotiated by females in their formative         years.) And she writes in "navels": "on the surface they're just America/but         they care deeply/down with the lint &amp;/another mother/points to a museumed         crucifiction/&amp; says to her very young son/'that's Jesus Christ'/kid         says/'dead/huh'/there is no cast of public navel/number one". And from         Levitsky's poem "Attica": "We, suckers, still stuck/in the hallway/will         have to watch/and watch again." In these lines (&amp; I will teeter on         the edge of grandiose) I hear these poets calling up, phrasing, contemporaneous         exile, in a way that's both legend and realism.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">______________________________________________</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>NOTE</b>:         for ordering and other info on these and other chapbooks, please see also         the Tiny Press Center at http://www.poetryproject.com.
