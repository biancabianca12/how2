In         Susan Howe's poetry it relates to the space on a page that has no verbal         language imprinted on it, yet it essays to speak.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Fool's         cap</b>: a dunce's hat, of the type that one would wear when being punished         in the classroom and forced to sit on a stool in a corner. In this poem         the dunce's hat refers to King Lear's stupid behavior in the Shakespeare         play towards his daughters, especially Cordelia, and to the final confusion         in the play as to who is the fool, Lear or the fool or Tom (Edgar of Gloucester         playing the part of the crazy beggar).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Fool's         cap</b>: a pointed hat with bells, worn by the fool in court, not merely         a jester but also one who through the guise of humor could openly criticize         the king. Guise is important in this poem, but also in the play <i>King         Lear</i>. In both works clothing indicates a certain flexibility of identity,         that can be shaped at will by superficial appearance, but this very malleability         in its slipperiness induces anxiety about who one is, about what defines         one's self.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Argument</b>:         In the silence between the mad gasps in this poem surfaces the lost remnants         of Cordelia, of woman, of the one who remains unable to express herself.         For this is Cordelia's problem, isn't it? She is unable to put her emotions         into words: "I cannot heave/ my heart into my mouth" (I.i,91-2). And she         loses her dowry, her father's love, and her life because she will not         pretend to be able to attempt to explain to her father the extent of her         love for him. Ann Vickery suggests that like Antigone, Stella and Cordelia         "are rendered exiles though heeding their duty of love over duty to the         state"(94), but Cordelia, [perhaps], is exiled not only from her own country,         but from her language, from its inability to express intangible and irrational         qualities.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>History         and Silence</b>: Susan Howe often talks about history and how it has elided         women and how in doing so, women have lost their ability to speak or to         speak coherently. This poem replicates this repression of expression,         mirrored in French's remark in King Lear on hearing Lear's reason for         disowning Cordelia: "Is it but this? A tardiness in nature/ Which often         leaves the history </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">unspoke/That         it intends to do"(I.i, 235-7). And so, as Vickery says, "Concerned with         the violence of history through representation, Howe returns to the dead         in order to commemorate, in the sense of remembering them as subjects"         (93).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The poem         talks about women's inability to participate directly in history: "we         are left darkling/ waiting in the wings again" (176), but how because         we "have forgotten" history, we must go back to the original moments,         that "vagueness of the scene/ where action takes place" (176). "I can         re//trac// my steps," says the narrator, "Iwho//crawl// between thwarts//         Do not come down the ladder// for I// haveaten// it a// way" (177). "Trac"         is a part of trace or track, to get back into the past, to find one's         way. To eat it a way is both to destroy the route, the ladder, by consuming         it, and to make a way by eating, to cut a pathway, thereby both erasing         the route and delineating it.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In <i>Pythagorean         Silence</i> Howe writes, "Text of traces," traces of text across the ocean         in that case, across the sky and the page in this one, very much the way         Mallarme tosses the dice across the page in <i>Un coup de des.</i>. "But         crucial words outside the book/ those words are bullets./ Lodged in the         </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">ebbing         actual/ women in the flight of time stand framed"(178). These are the         words that Howe seeks to recover, those outside the book of history where         women's voices and actions have been relegated. "If you are a woman,"         Howe says in The Birthmark, "archives hold perpetual ironies. Because         the </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">gaps         and silences are where you find yourself" (158).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Peter Quartermain         and Vickery discern Howe's effort to recast history for, as Quartermain         says, "History, like language, is not and cannot be linear" (194) and         Vickery concurs by suggesting that "The Book of Cordelia" syntactically         reflects the gaps of the histories, whilst foregrounding an </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">alternate         layer of meaning that lies within marginalia through sound shifts and         patterns"(99). The poem mimics history as Howe reframes it in order to         recoup what is not said overtly in the history books, in order to find         the "words outside the book."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Silence         of Speech/ sound of language</b>: The poem starts with a "heroine in ass-skin,"         not merely wearing garments depicting a lower social stature than hers,         but asking a question, asking one unheard and unanswered, because, perhaps,         her voice is soundless, "mouthing O Helpful" (171) but not saying it.         Howe says in The Birthmark, "Silence becomes a Self. Open your mouth.         . . . In such silence women were talking. Undifferentiated powerlessness         swallowed them" (50). In not </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">speaking,         Cordelia loses all that is important to her. The poem says, "Cordelia         dies" (175) and "reclasp[s] her hands into obscurity"(175), since a woman's         valorous actions do not merit historical validation.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the play         <i>King Lear</i> the lesson is that Cordelia's inability to describe her         feelings for her father is normal, and her dismissal of flowery empty         language shows the depth of her integrity. "If for I want that glib and         oily art/ To speak and purpose not since what I well intend," she argues,         I'll do’t before I speak. . ."(I.i, 224-5). Edgar reinforces this sentiment         in the last, morally laden lines of the play: "Speak what we feel, not         what we ought to say"(V,iii,325). Cordelia's actions, or inactions, really,         are appropriate but the cost of her speechlessness is her loss in history         and the, albeit temporary, deprivation of her father's love.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Can you         not see/ arme armes [weapon weapons]/ give tongue/ are you silent o my         swift/ all coherence gone?"(176). So the poem transfers speech to weapons         of war, "to give tongue" as a physical manifestation of the speech act.         But this speech makes no sense and the "you" the audience? Cordelia? Is         unable to speak at all. When verbal utterance occurs in this poem, it         is inarticulate, incoherent. The Hero of the poem can only "spittle speak//         only nonsense"(171). He is "bellowing augury,"(171) like <i>King Lear’s</i>         Edgar's (Tom O'Bedlam's) speech. It makes no sense but sounds like it         might portend something.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>"hrr/         hrru/ hurry/ hare/ haloo/ cry Whoop/ and cry Spy!"</b>: Howe says in her         <i>Difficulties </i>interview that "sound is part of the mystery," (21),         that excision of the surface meaning of language leaves only the sound,         a pattern of expression that might well recuperate gaps in history.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Quartermain         calls this "a stuttering narrative of inarticulation unspoken within the         narrative"(187). The poem, then, represents Howe's effort to find what         has been unspoken, or what has been incoherently spoken, to piece together         the fragmented shards of the remains of the woman in history.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Blank         paper: The words outside the book</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The poem         talks about poetry: "pauses measures feet in syllables caesura Copernicus,"         but in so doing, it ruptures tradition and splinters meaning in order         to reconceive of language and of how it appears on the page (173). Quartermain         proclaims that "the impulse to disorder in the world leaves its mark in         the sheer isolation of Howe's poems on the page, surrounded by white:         a visible trope of Howe's tough and difficult feminism. There are figurations         in these figures who are figured against no ground, who move away from         ground, who move without" (193).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The comparison         to the visual arts in Howe's poetry is common, as she began work as a         painter, but the relation between figure/ground perspective and her style         is elucidating, for isn't it the structure of the language that cements         the hegemony at play in history? To disrupt this structure is to fracture         what is accepted as "logic" in this culture in the same way that to eradicate         single-point perspective dissolves the ground in a painting, or turns         everything depicted in a painting equally into ground by dismissing hierarchy         of focus.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Part of         grounding in the verbal forms derives from sentence structure, but the         occurrence of complete sentences is rare here and usually avoids connecting         meaning to their place in the poem. . . Because of this continuous undercutting         of the lines that superficially appear to be comprehensible according         to standard rules of the language, Howe successfully forces attention         to the spaces on the page, those uncovered (not only not covered by but         also those exposed) by text. After the "no no no" and the slant of the         "hrr/ hrru/ hurry/ hare/ haloo/ cry Whoop/ and cry Spy!" the space takes         over in the absence of literal meaning. What is not said by Cordelia,         by women in history, surfaces in the silence in the space of time next         to "the sun/ is a cloud/ of dust" and on either side of the ladder, for         even though she has eaten it away and can move across rather than up or         down, "athwart," we cannot help but descend into the void of anti-representation.         Negative space is what some people call it, referring </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">to         the space left by a work of sculpture, but how can space be negative?         It fills the void. By creating the void, Howe permits the space of the         memory of women to surface, the negative memory.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At the same         time, her rejection of sequential event, of plot, of consequence, forces         the words on the page to devolve into the emblematic, static and crystallized         "as if nothing has happened" in parentheses with a large space to the         left. The sun is a pivotal image in this poem, "threshing the sun's corona"         "chromosphere" "Copernicus" "the sun/ is a cloud/ of dust." The sun is         a witness of all that has been lost in history, the central litmus of         identity, but the poet cannot recuperate these losses </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">and         remains anxious about the fissures in memory and the cost to Cordelia         of speechlessness: "heartrending"; "I will go to my desk/ I will sit quietly/         . . . what is eaten is gone"(175).</font></p>      <hr>      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Works Cited</b></font>       <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe, Susan.         <i>The Birth-mark: Unsettling the Wilderness in American Literary History</i>.         Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1993.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">---.
