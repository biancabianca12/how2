Yeah, a troubador. ENTERTAIN comes from <i>entre</i>         and <i>tenir</i> &#151; a holding between &#133; the legs? Or ears? Or         is the enacted creative a sacred limbo between persons like the internet,         an intersubjective field of poppies? My dictionary sends me to TENABLE         from the etymology for ENTERTAIN, and the synonyms I find there are DEFENSIBLE         and REASONABLE, and now I&#146;m thinking, ha! this is the funniest thing         I&#146;ve ever heard. Poetics, how I <i>love</i> poetics, those glass         conservatories filled with giant lotus leaves and banana trees and the         smell of unusual mildews. The tropical becomes tenable as the rain that         foments it, and the more tropical a poem is the better I like it (moist         heat). Our challenge: how to live among all these tropes, every life a         trope as we are figures&#133;of speechflesh &#133; and we are constantly         turning &#133; over in bed or towards or away from each other &#133; or         towards the sun or finally into the soil &#133;. Poetry drips with (these)         movement(s), each word meaning kaleidoscoping into an aromatic delirium         of philosophy. I want to be there with you.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Love, </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"
