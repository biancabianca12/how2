<P>A man whose narratives could be credited as mirrors of reality was a modest man: his reports ought to make that modest visible.</P>

<P>The modest witness is the sender and receiver of messages in my e-mail address. So let us investigate how this subject position is woven into the nets traced here. The modest witness is a figure in the narrative net of this book, which works to <I>refigure</I> the subjects, objects, and communicative commerce of techno-science into different kinds of knots. I am consumed by the project of materialized refiguration; I think that is what’s happening in the worldly projects of technoscience and feminism. A figure collects up the people; a figure embodies shared meanings in stories that inhabit their audiences. I take the term <I>modest witness</I> from the important book by Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer (1985), <I>Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life</I>. In order for the modesty, referred to in the epigraph above to be visible, the man—the witness whose accounts mirror reality—must be invisible, that is, the inhabitant of the potent &quot;unmarked category,&quot; which is constructed by the extraordinary conventions of self-invisibility. In Sharon Traweek’s wonderfully suggestive terms, such a man must inhabit the space perceived by its inhabitants to be the &quot;culture of no culture&quot; (1988).</P>

<P>That’s the Museum of Modern Art for you! But to return to the dogmatism of Breton and others—it was he who named it <I>D&eacute;jeuner en fourrure</I>, playing on the association with queer sexuality in Manet’s <I>D&eacute;jeuner sur l’herbe</I> and Sacher-Masoch’s <I>V&eacute;nus en fourrures</I>. The word-games of critics, the power struggles of men! So part of its scandalous appeal was not invented by me. It was a fluke. I had been making bits of fur-covered jewelry to make a little money in 1936. I showed a piece of Picasso and Dora Maar and they joked that anything could be covered with fur—the chairs, the door. I added the cups and the saucers on the table. I was thinking only of the contrast of material textures. Later, Breton asked me to participate in the Ratton show. I simply made up the object according to the idea. I didn’t care about any title at all. I don’t really care that it is now known by Breton’s title.</P>
