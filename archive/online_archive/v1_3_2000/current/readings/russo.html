When         it comes to poetic production, we see women at once marginalized imaginatively,         set in a metaphorized relation vis a vis male poets (the feminine as a         locus of male fantasies and fears, etc.), and also materially, at a certain         distance to the processes and products of these movements of &quot;the         new.&quot; In the production of poetry and poetic manifestoes and other         such directives, men reign (though Mina Loy obviously took exception to         the rule). And when we look to the publication (reproduction) of these         texts, we might remember the various pots Ezra Pound had a hand in, editorially         intervening upon Dora Marsdens <i>The Egoist</i> (1914-19), n&eacute;e         <i>The New Freewoman</i> (1913), Harriet Monroes <i>Poetry</i> (1912-1936)         and Margaret Andersons <i>The Little Review</i> (1914-1929). Marianne         Moore edited <i>The Dial </i>from 1925-1929, and while many histories         of Moores editorship cast her in the margins of her own presumed lack         of self-confidence (thus was construed her consultations with her &quot;senior&quot;         editors Scofield Thayer and James Sibley Watson), she might be viewed         rather as a central operative figure maintaining correspondence out of         a sense of (institutional and personal) respect. Certainly documentary         evidence, and the initiative she took in reinstating<i> The Dial</i>s         relationship with then-estranged foreign correspondent Pound and in encouraging,         in reviews and through publication, the work of Gertrude Stein, suggests         that rather than being in some aspect marginal to modernist poetic production,         or forced to the margins of editorial initiative at<i> The Dial, </i>she         chose rather to be absorbed in what Jayne Marek has called the collective         &quot;Editorial We&quot; -- a somewhat uncategorizable, because non-centric         yet non-marginal, position. Vexatious to literary historians. Women editors         pushed into the poetic margins of their own print productions. And in         poetic productions, even Pounds heralded few -- H.D. and Mina Loy, e.g.         -- subsequently were marginalized/excized in acts of scholarly concision.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Feminist         scholarship, in recovering the works of these and other women writers,         has tended toward &quot;subversion&quot; as an axis, as a point of location,         a &quot;gynesis&quot; whereby women could be seen at work in and on the         field of traditionally masculine poetic production. Subverting lyric gender         ideologies, subverting/scattering unified subjectivity, subverting &quot;other&quot;         into the &quot;New Woman&quot; subject (i.e. Mina Loy, 1917); subverting         poetic production so that it might both contain her and destroy the container.         Though modernist writers were highly suspicious of metaphor, women continued         to write under the symbol &quot;Woman.&quot; The path was, from the margins,         symbolic subversion; the rest is herstory.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Of the         Field of Poetic Production</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In the         recently published anthology <i>Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative         Writing by Women</i>, editor Mary Margaret Sloans organizing principle         locates the field of production as an important context to our understanding         of contemporary innovative poetry. Rather than ordering contributors by         birthdate, she signifies &quot;entry into the public domain of a literary         or arts community&quot;(7), by relying on publishing chronology -- paying         heed to the role the small press has played in the dissemination of innovative         writing. A theory of such a context is developed in Pierre Bourdieus         <i>The Field of Cultural Production</i>: &quot;The literary or artistic         field is a field of forces, but it is also a field of struggles tending         to transform or conserve this field of forces.&quot; Im not so much concerned         with &quot;the specific profits (such as literary prestige) which are         at stake in the field&quot;(30), i.e. not so concerned with the fact that         by taking a position in the field one puts oneself in proximity with said         profits. For Bourdieu the field of production is a site of hierarchical         struggle between the &quot;heteronomous principal&quot; (the bourgeois         state) and the &quot;autonomous principal&quot; (the anti-bourgeois avant-garde),         and thus the bottom line is economic, a &quot;struggle in the field of         cultural production over the imposition of the legitimate modes of cultural         production&quot; which is inseparably a &quot;struggle within the dominant         class&quot;(41). This is simply, in small press production at this moment,         not the issue. Also of little immediate interest are the effects innovators         taking positions in the field of production enact on genre, though there         has been, and continues to be, much to be said. This latter is the project         of feminist scholarship -- endeavoring to position one or another marginalized         woman poet into her justified position in the field. Im concerned with         what I might perhaps call sub-genre, with the poetic practices that are         introduced into the field, and which consequently signify a certain sort         of poetic production (i.e. &quot;formal,&quot; &quot;innovative,&quot;         &quot;experimental,&quot; etc.), and that are taken up as a sign of entry         into the field. And Im especially concerned with this as a particularly         gendered position-taking, evident in the women-edited small press phenomena         that has, since the 1950s, changed the field of innovative poetic production.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since 1953         (when Daisy Aldan began co-editing <i>Folder</i>, a major outlet for New         York avant-garde poets and artists, with Richard Miller, and continuing         through the sixties as Diane di Prima, Margaret Randall, Rosmarie Waldrop,         Anne Waldman and Bernadette Mayer co-edited little magazines and small         presses (usually with a husband or lover) -- women poet-editors have started         over 70 such ventures devoted to innovative poetry, almost half of these         since 1990 alone. In endeavoring to edit and publish a little magazine,         one enacts a position-taking that is qualitatively different than the         sort of positioning one makes in writing poetry or being published. Since         literary historians look largely to (and selectively through) written         documentation, recognition amongst ones contemporaries without representation         in contemporary print production is tantamount to erasure. Devoted to         furthering innovative explorations, a woman poet-editor enacts a feminist         poetic by inserting her editorial agenda and making editorial decisions         that affect the poetic community. Representation is not a byproduct of         the politics of poetic practice, but a co-production. Her activity recasts         the field of poetic production to include a wider variety of practices         (and practitioners). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Post-Marginal         Animadversions</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Though there         are undoubtedly fewer women than men involved in innovative poetry and         poetics, I hesitate to maintain &quot;marginal&quot; as a position-marker.         The recent conference at Barnard (&quot;Where Lyric and Language Meet:         Innovation in Contemporary Poetry by Women&quot;) and symposium at Bards         Institute of Thinking and Writing attest to the centrality of women poets         and poet-critics in the imagining of the field of innovative poetic production.         In numbers, young contemporary women poet-editors nearly match the bulk         of their male cohorts. Its not merely coincident that these same are         also post-Language and thus partaking of those theories of poetic invention         and intervention that took shape in the establishment of a now vital small         press community. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Against         a backdrop of prohibitive literary history, asserting ones editorial         position, as well as writing and agreeing to have ones work read and         published -- insomuch as these amount to an exercise of agency -- is a         feminist undertaking. The appearance of women writers and editors upset         the prevalence of a set of top-heavy relations (subject/object, speaker/listener,         viewer/viewed) and served to fully deconstruct the hegemonic order of         feminist realism and masculinist innovation that preceded it. But where         previously the struggle was unmistakably gendered, now it is unclear how         gender functions in the production of innovative poetry and poetics. Bourdieu:         &quot;the field of cultural production is the site of struggles in which         what is at stake is the power to impose the dominant definition of the         writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take         part in the struggle to define the writer&quot;(42). Since the birth of         feminist literary scholarship, but especially since the 1980s, the struggle         has been to &quot;consecrate,&quot; to unearth, modernist women writers         and to legitimate their writing practices as poetic practices -- to deem         their various modes of writing as poetry -- and as engaged also in the         &quot;more important&quot; issues at hand in the public sphere, to say         for example that Emily Dickinson, George Eliot, and Gertrude Stein are         not &quot;merely&quot; domestic writers. The struggle also has been to         legitimize contemporary poetic practices as poetry (cf. <i>How(ever)</i>)         and to turn critical response to those practices: to shape (and gender)         reception, to shape (and gender) those practices, to shape and gender         the field of poetic production. To wit: Much work reproduced in the &quot;Poetics         and Exposition&quot; segment of <i>Moving Borders</i> was produced in         the 1980s, such as Rachel Blau DuPlessis &quot;Otherhow,&quot; Lyn Hejinians         &quot;Rejection of Closure,&quot; Susan Howes <i>My Emily Dickinson </i>and         Leslie Scalapinos &quot;Note on My Writing, 1985.&quot; The value of         womens writing to the field of poetic production is positively defined.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Bourdieu:         &quot;Position taking changes, even when the position remains identical,         whenever there is a change in the universe of options that are simultaneously         offered for producers and consumers to choose from. The meaning of a work...         changes automatically with each change in the field within which it is         situated for spectator or reader&quot;(30). What does &quot;innovative&quot;         feminist work by a contemporary mean? A younger poet taking up the available         poetic practices enacts a radical derealization of their once-politic         effects, for the newly constructed poem fails to realize (make real) the         political potential with which the strategy was introduced. &quot;Ignorance         of everything which goes to make up the mood of the age produces a derealization         of the works: stripped of everything which attached them to the most concrete         debates of their time . . . they are impoverished and transformed in the         direction of intellectualism or empty humanism&quot; or what appears to         be the new unified subject; the anti-subject subject who from the fractures         emerges whole. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;How         to talk about this new (feminist?) subject? At a point when innovative         women poets are no longer marginal, does it make sense to speak of subversion         as a poetic tactic? Or a poetic trinket? Is gender still a relevant for         locating subversive (or not) poetic practices by women? It remains, indeed,         a crucial question for existence on a material, daily level. To be clear:         the frame or the context, that which hinges the ever pervasive metonymies         and abstractions, the babes of the New Sentence, is the new metaphor that         we might, like moderinsts, be suspicious of. For despite heterogeneous         (and anti-hegemonic) poetic practices, a new subject, recognizeable as         a unified subject, has re-emerged. Margin and subversion, once-useful         points of critique that did frame the problematic, have now become subsumed         in the frame, have become part of its materials and methods. Once politicized,         now aestheticized. Thus having announced ones affiliation to a certain         aesthetic or tradition by taking up a particular set of strategies, announcing,         as it were, ones position in the field of production, the question becomes         whether this alignment further politicizes or merely aestheticizes those         strategies as &quot;givens.&quot; </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Bourdieus         Marxist roots -- as in the lexicon of production and consumption -- will         prove, momently, its continued relevance to the situation at hand despite         the fact that, as Ive said, the issue is not &quot;specific profits&quot;         (i.e. cultural capital) but, strictly speaking, poetics, as a prescriptive         and proscriptive indicator. For what emerges is a new, linguistically         coded poetic subject, a sort of hip billboard which is an advertisement         for the acquiescence of the subject to hegemony, for which one needs only         the decoder technology to read.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;So while         the &quot;difficult modernist text&quot; has given way to the possibility         of a &quot;difficult but decodable text,&quot; discerning the context         of production emerges as the new difficulty; discerning it, to figure         out where it has gone awry in relation to specific points of feminist         and poetic interest. &quot;When a new literary or artistic group makes         its presence felt in the field of literary or artistic production, the         whole problem is transformed, since its coming into being, i.e. into difference,         modifies and displaces the universe of possible options; the previously         dominant productions may, for example, be pushed into the status either         of outmoded [<i>d&eacute;class&eacute;</i>] or of classic works&quot;(32).         How are these &quot;new&quot; groups (are they?) making their presences         felt (are they?). The little magazines used to be the organ of the movement;         now the movement, the &quot;new&quot; as an aesthetic, is an organ of         the little magazine, and the presence of the multitude produced is felt         in proliferation, the whelm of dispersion.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In Bourdieus         field, conflict rather than consensus is the prized outcome. Let it not         be assumed that Im demanding that innovative womens poetry today enact         in practice an effect it presumes in theory. An effect -- feminist or         post-feminist -- assumes a historical, political and/or aesthetic relation         to a cause, most recently those questions of gender, of representation,         of textuality, of subjectivity, of translation, of authorship, that is         if we take <i>Moving Borders</i> as an indication of particular, and particularly         valued (&quot;innovative&quot;) causes. But rather Im asking that innovative         (womens) poetry today articulate for itself particular critical points         of coherence, conflict, or departure from the rubric constructed by previous         poetic endeavors -- to claim a position in the field; and that women critics         and poet-critics continue to articulate those points of what might be         called feminist intervention in innovative poetic production.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Works         Cited</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bourdieu,         Pierre. <i>The Field of Cultural Production: essays on art and literature</i>.         Edited and &#9;introduced by Randal Johnson.
