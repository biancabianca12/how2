Introduction</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Although         surrealism is considered central to European modernist experimentation         during the interwar period (1919-1939), recent work on New York School         poetry and on women writers and surrealism has begun to spur reassessment         of its post-World War Two influence. <a href="#1"><kbd>1</kbd></a> <a name="influence"></a>Along         these lines, I am interested in exploring how poets associated with the         New York School drew on the surrealist tradition in their attempt to forge         an avant-garde at a time when art's distinction from mainstream culture         no longer seemed possible. More specifically, the rise of institutional         forms of patronage for the literary and visual arts in the form of government-sponsored         arts endowments; the growth of creative writing programs and teaching         posts; the establishment of museums for modernist art; and the rapidly         expanding consumer market for postwar art, all rendered a space for aesthetic         practices "outside" of the dominant economy and its cultural institutions         difficult. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Postwar         artists in New York -- painters as well as poets -- certainly participated         in and profited from the institutional patronage of the arts. Yet this         patronage was double-edged; many were critical of institutional intersections         with cold war militarism, expanding markets abroad, and repressive social         and moral codes at home. The renewed presence of surrealism in New York,         due in large part to the European surrealists in exile, influenced the         call for an "art of everyday life" that could resist the hegemonic pressures         of state and corporate power. <a href="#2"><kbd>2</kbd></a> <a name="power"></a>In         Europe, Dada and surrealism had defined themselves as avant-garde movements         by opposing the aims and values of bourgeois culture as embodied in the         art museum. The museum would prove a potent symbol of cultural production         in the post-World War Two U.S. as well; thus we might consider the oppositional         energies of theatrical "happenings"; of the situationist movement; of         Joseph Cornell's miniature boxes filled with the ephemeral objects and         debris of urban commerce; and of the poetry of Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery,         and Barbara Guest in the context of the museum.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Often,         poets writing after 1945 represent the museum as the embodiment of the         forces of </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">rationalization,         bureaucratization, and commodification which threaten to subsume, absorb,         or negate the lyric as an individual utterance (I am thinking here of         Ashbery's "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror" and O'Hara's "Lunch Poems").         <a href="#3"> <kbd>3</kbd></a> <a name="poems"></a>To counter this threat,         New York School poets not only blur distinctions between high and popular         culture, art and experience, but also attempt to carve out a space for         "private" desire within the framework of cultural institutions and postwar         consumerism. <a href="#4"><kbd>4</kbd></a> <a name="conumerism"></a>Ashbery         and O'Hara did so while working professionally as art critics and in O'Hara's         case, as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;With         the museum as a site of cultural production in mind, I would like to consider         (in very preliminary fashion) the 1940's poetry of Mina Loy, "Compensations         of Poverty" (1942-9) alongside Alice Notley's most recent book, <i>Mysteries         of Small Houses</i> (1998). <a href="#5"><kbd>5</kbd></a> <a name="1998"></a>Although         Mina Loy is not usually discussed in the context of the New York School,         I would argue that her work written in New York in the 1940s has much         in common --thematically, stylistically, and culturally -- with New York         School poetry of the 1950s and 60s. Loy left Paris for New York in 1939         and remained there until 1953; while in New York she was in contact with         other European artists in exile and developed a close friendship with         Joseph Cornell, whose work would prove influential to post-1945 American         poets. Alice Notley, a self-described "second-generation" New York School         poet, left New York in the 1980s for permanent residence in Paris, reversing         Loy's trajectory. In the texts I discuss, both poets articulate and even         celebrate a poetry grounded in poverty and anonymity; while we might be         tempted to view these gestures as reinscriptions of the women poet's marginalized         status, reading Loy's and Notley's work in the context of avant-garde         responses to the museum in the post-1945 era suggests that both poets         view anonymity as the grounds for a gendered cultural critique. While         Ashbery and O'Hara make room for oppositional desire inside the museum,         Loy and Notley use their exclusion from such institutions to expose the         machinery of cultural power. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>II. Mina         Loy, "Compensations of Poverty"</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         destitute men and women who people Loy's 1940s poems are not simply figures         for </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the         poet, but Loy's interest in these figures certainly permitted her to reflect         on her own status -- as an &eacute;migr&eacute;, as a former celebrity         now living in anonymity in the Bowery, as an aging woman, as someone who         appears to have no further use to society. Thus she begins "On Third Avenue"         with a quotation: "You should have disappeared years ago" (LB 109). While         this voice might represent that of mainstream society, directed at the         bums whose presence mocks postwar productivity and progress, we might         also read this voice as directed at Loy, a "relic" of European modernism         who has shamelessly hung on past her moment. Loy responds, "so disappear         / on Third Avenue / to share the heedless incognito / of shuffling shadow-bodies,"         and in "Compensations of Poverty," the poet beckons us to follow.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Maeera         Shreiber argues that these poems register the trauma of World War II:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Most             of these poems are written either during or shortly after World War             II; and, by virtue of the aged status of many of the bodies represented             there, it seems clear that Loy's 'angels' are truly of 'history' --             at least in the sense of being time-bound. By considering how these             poems constitute a response to the trauma of what has been described             as a 'historically ungraspable event' ... we can perhaps begin the             project of engaging with these poems as an integral part of Loy's             corpus. <a href="#6"><kbd>6</kbd></a> <a name="corpus"></a></font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While history         and trauma have undoubtedly caused the poverty and homelessness Loy witnesses,         the pain of the destitute remains inarticulate, visible only as it deforms         their bodies, "animate with frustration." They drift through life without         impact, as ghosts or "mummies / half unwound." Marked by their "vast unfuture"         (LB 135), they seem to await death; as Loy comments in "An Aged Woman,"         "The past has come apart / events are vagueing / the future is inexploitable         / / the present pain" (LB 145).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;We might         read "On Third Avenue" and "Hot Cross Bum" -- Loy's guided tours of the         Bowery --as transformations of "Lunar Baedeker," Loy's earlier tour (1923)         of "Delirious Avenues / lit / with the chandelier souls / of infusoria"         (LB 81). The landscape of "Lunar Baedeker" is a "Necropolis," both metropolis         and cemetery (the OED defines "necropolis" as "a dead city, a city of         the dead; a city in the final stages of social and economic degeneration").         As such it is a city defined by visible absences, by the signs of what         was once present, a city as seen in dreams or negatives held up to the         light. The narrated journey is colorless, guided only by glowing "Phosphorus"         and the "eye-white sky-light / white-light district / of lunar lusts";         the craters are "evacuate," the Orient "oxidized," and Eros "obsolete."         All is used up, dry, bloodless, an imagery of absence which culminates         in Loy's view of the lunar necropolis as a museum:</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;And         "Immortality"</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">mildews...</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">in the museums         of the moon</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;"Nocturnal         cyclops"</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Crystal         concubine"</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">--- --- ---         --- --- --- ---</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Pocked         with personification</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the fossil         virgin of the skies</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">waxes and         wanes--- --- --- --- (LB 82)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Placing         "Immortality" in quotation marks, Loy suggests that it is a product of         the museum, defined by the museum's claims to the permanent value of its         collections. Immortality (and works deemed immortal) are ironically, therefore,         subject to history (mildew) and change. Loy may also invoke "Museums of         the moon" to juxtapose human museums (and concepts of history, value,         and permanence) with the history of the moon. The moon in its remoteness,         age, and impenetrability mocks human efforts to map and master it; in         the poem, the moon can only be approximated by Loy's dashes or by the         disfiguring personifications of literary tradition. Loy's "baedeker,"         then, while it makes room for her imagination, also serves as an anti-tourist         guide, a guide to human pretensions to knowledge and immortality embodied         in the museum and in the guidebooks which claim to chronicle a nation's         cultural treasures.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9; While         "Lunar Baedeker" invokes dreams and cocaine as agents of vision, "On Third         Avenue" and "Hot Cross Bum" rely only on human sight; the speaker in "Third         Avenue" walks down a "red-lit thoroughfare," illuminated by "neon-signs"         rather than "stellectric" signs (LB 109). Like Frank O'Hara, whom she         resembles in her peripatetic style and accumulation of visual detail,         Loy describes the stuff of the street and of mass culture lovingly, as         worthy of reverence in her 1940s poems. More pointedly, Loy finds value         in that which is human, mutable, and fleeting, that which resists the         permanence of the "museums of the moon": </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Such         are compensations of poverty, </font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">to see -------</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Transient         in the dust,</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the brilliancy</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">of a trolley</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">loaded with         luminous busts;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">lovely in         anonymity</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">they vanish</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">with the         mirage</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">of their         passage.

Maeera         Schreiber reads this interest as continuous with Loy's "life-long spiritual         quest" (469); thus, "Loy's visions are as much concerned with what is         concealed as with what is revealed" (474). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Yet         Loy's interest in concealment and anonymity also speaks to her efforts         to make visible lives that were erased by postwar culture; like the earlier         "Lunar Baedeker," her tours of the Bowery constitute an effort to register         the values and pressures of mainstream society through its visible absences.         Trash -- and its removal -- becomes the central metaphor and medium for         Loy's Bowery Baedekers, as this passage from "Hot Cross Bum" makes clear:         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Collecting         refuse more profuse than man </font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the City's         circulatory </font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">sanitary         apostles </font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">a-leap to         ash-cans </font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">apply their         profane ritual </font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">to offal         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dust         to dust</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Even a putrescent         Galaxy</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">could not         be left where it lay</font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">to disgust</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;scrapped         are remains </font><br>        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">empty cans         remain.

Carolyn Burke suggests a critical         engagement with the avant-garde (specifically Du Champ and Cornell) at         work in Loy's choice to use actual trash as the material for the collages         she made in the 40s, observing that "...unlike either of these innovative         recyclers, Mina brought to her shabby materials an acute sense of the         cost involved for those who searched the garbage cans: rather than posing         as outsiders, as the avant-garde had done, they actually lived at the         bottom of the heap." <a href="#7"><kbd>7</kbd></a> <a name="heap"></a></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In other         words, Loy -- at this late stage in her career suffering both anonymity         and critical neglect -- was able to bring to the avant-garde position         of "outsiderdom" a lived sense of "the cost involved." While anonymity         was not a choice, in its guise Loy extended her project in "Lunar Baedeker"         to the visible necropolis of the Bowery, exposing the suffering and beauty         of those who live outside "the museums of the moon."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>III.         Alice Notley, Mysteries of Small Houses</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Alice         Notley describes the aim of her book <i>Mysteries of Small House</i><u>s</u>         (1998) thus: </font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I was             firstly trying to realize the first person singular as fully and nakedly             as possible, saying "I" in such a way as to make myself really nervous,             really blowing away the gauze and making myself too scared of life             and death to care what anyone thought of me or what I was going to             say.

Thus         Notley describes<i> Alette </i>as "dead in me," and confronts in the museum         her "own form / stuffed and staring." The repeated use of quotation marks         (which Notley also uses throughout<i> Alette </i>and which she describes         as a new form of "measure") imply that the separation of self and text         is inevitable, the act of writing marking the entrance of her language         into the public (quotable) domain. As a symbol of the forces of public         recognition and commemoration, the museum threatens to subsume Notley's         past experiences and her private investments in her poetry into its rationalized         understanding of her work's historical importance and value. Notley resists         this, stating that she is not interested in<i> Alette's </i>"literary         worth" but simply wants it "alive again."

(MSH 110). In the resolution         of the poem, the speaker does not find this "real self," but walks "down         the corridor" "Into more" "darkness..." The specimens come alive and the         poet declares:</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...         "Now I fly for I" "was not this world"<br>        </font> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"as         museum" "I is not a" "museum: my loves live" "and I can leave now" </font><br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"I         can't relive Alette" "can only let it melt" "and my loves live, not </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in         the past" "but in the present" (MSH 111)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The cost         of the speaker's forward movement is allowing<i> Alette </i>to "melt"         or disappear into the past.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Although         the "museum" and the public pressures it represents are certainly real         ones, alluding to the unspoken pressures of living as a professional poet,         Notley implies that she can resolve these pressures by rejecting the values         embodied by the museum. Like Loy, she invokes the museum to distinguish         her work from it, choosing anonymity and an understanding of self as temporal         process over the museum's powerful yet static forms of recognition and         commemoration. This embrace of anonymity is not a rejection of the desire         to have her work's importance and merit recognized, but is rather an attempt         to elicit a particular kind of recognition on the part of her reader,         a recognition opposed to the forms of naming she aligns with the museum.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Notley's         prose description of<i> Alette </i>clarifies the feminist values implicit         in her embrace of anonymity and her critique of the museum:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It <i>[Alette]</i>             was for me an immense act of rebellion against dominant social forces,             against the fragmented forms of modern poetry, against the way a poem             was supposed to look according to both past and contemporary practice.             It begins in pieces and ends whole, narrated by an I who doesn't know             her name and whose name when she finds it means appendage of a male             name; her important name is I.
