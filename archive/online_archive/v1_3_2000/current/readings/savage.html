Austin, <i>How to Do Things with Words</i> (first epigraph             of Joan Retallack's <i>How To Do Things With Words</i>)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In a         1993 graduate seminar on women modernists, I became first acquainted with         Laura Riding's poetry and began immediately to write about her. In part,         Riding's poetry itself motivated me to write as a way of entering into         her poetics that, in some poems, manage at once to leave much of the page's         space open and to generate the sense that, despite the small, ordinary         nouns and articles comprising the poem, the page nearly snaps under its         pressure. More imperative, though, was my desire to figure out how Riding's         poems took forms conventional in meter, subject, and lyric ties and stuffed         them with words that defied the narratives the formal aspects invoked.         Most of all, I hurried to write about Riding to defend her work from scholars         and poets who insisted that her "failed" quest for truth was intellectually         overwrought, anti-feminist, anti-woman, boring, overrated, and, the ultimate         kiss of death, utopic. (Utopia: Love it or leave it!) </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Ultimately,         I wrote a dissertation chapter on Riding that located her in an ongoing         conversation among women poets of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,         converted my director to Riding advocacy, and demonstrated the ways in         which her poetics refute the opposition of "expressive" and "experimental"         in critical discourses. This false dichotomy of "lyric" and "language-oriented"         poetry, though showing signs of diminishing force in feminist criticism,         continues to dominate evaluations of women's poetry: Proponents of "experimental"         writing argue that "language-centered" poetry abandons the lyric "I" constituted         in referential language in favor of a multifarious, intellectual voice         always in the process of becoming and thus able to slip the yoke of gender         essentialism. On the other side of the argument, advocates of "expressive"         poetry--Sharon Olds and Adrienne Rich are often called upon as examples--recognize         a continuing need for an intelligible female voice to authenticate woman's         experiences and, thus documenting them, encourage social practices that         change the way gender functions in the real world. Riding's poetics continue         to provide ways of seeing that this mutually exclusive understanding of         the lyric and language poetry is a self-defeating fiction, just as her         work destabilizes the essentialist/constructivist binary. To recover Riding         for American poetry and for feminist poetics, I had, in part, to locate         her work among the very discourses her poetics obviate. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;To complete         a dissertation, one must be consistent and coherent: to assert as worthwhile         a complicated poet derided and repeatedly dismissed because she was ungrateful         and ungracious with those who (over)valued her work, one must give readings         of her works that track their meanings coherently and refute the dismissive         evaluations. In reading Riding's poems as part of her body of linguistic         and feminist theory, the cornerstone of which is the faith that true language         incurs true gender relations by accessing woman's difference, I avoided         making messes of Riding's logic or of mine. My goal then was to clean         up the messes making up Riding scholarship--and the lack thereof. The         main mess I sought to clean up was the assumption that Riding thought         women ought to be silent, just as Riding had chosen "silence" by renouncing         poetry as a means to truth. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;My soundest         evidence that Riding's "silence" was a misconception largely responsible         for the many misreadings of her poetry presented itself in a recently         published collection of resurrected essays by Riding entitled <i>The Word         Woman. </i>Included in the book is a 1963 questionnaire for the Italian         magazine <i>Civilta delle Macchine,</i> which sought the opinions of women         who had &quot;attained the highest ranks in their profession&quot; on         the &quot;problem&quot; of &quot;the fuller and progressive participation         of women in societal life&quot; (177), followed by Riding's response.         Riding scolds Dr. Giuliana Zavadini for her questionnaire which was and         would remain moot, in Riding's view, until societal and linguistic structures         were confronted with &quot;a new scrupulousness in our linguistic functioning,         [a scrupulousness that] puts our every attitude of mind to the tests of         human soundness that words alone can surely make&quot; <i>(WW</i> 173,         180). Riding concludes that "it is from dualism, precisely, that human         nature needs saving" and that men and women must take the initiative to         reconceive "all their being" (182). Written in her sixties, Riding's reading         of the questionnaire as an example of the "sexually confused linguistic         humanism" her poetics had endeavored to change by preparing a "new human         speaking-ground" (179) provided for me proof positive that Riding did         not advocate silence. To the contrary, she clearly maintained that language         use affected conditions and consequences in the real world. Riding thought         saying something was doing something. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In moments         that helped condemn her work as moot for both feminism and for poetry,         Riding's poems often examine the unsaid, the yet-to-be said, and the unspeakable         as full of potential to alter the world. Or this is how I have read those         silences, as ripe and powerful with the possibilities of words on a path         towards expression. Silence is resistance because it is a refusal to participate         actively in oppressive paradigms. But reticence does not preclude collusion         and is easily coopted by--or simply cooperates with--the forces it seeks         to undermine. One such troublesome silence circulates through Ridings         poem &quot;Chloe Or,&quot; which begins with a sardonic speaker's identification         of its subjects with the words they have not said and probably will not         say:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <dir>             <dir>               <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Chloe                 or her modern sister, Lil,<br>                Stepping one day over the fatal sill,<br>                Will say quietly: 'Behold the waiting equipage!'<br>                </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Or                 whistle Hello and end an age. <i>(PLR</i> 29)</font></p>            </dir>          </dir>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Joined by         their &quot;immortal,&quot; ahistorical existence in male-defined scripts         and their performances for exclusively male audiences, The True Woman         and the New Woman live the same way, despite Lil's nominal difference         from Chloe. This immortality, as the poem suggests, lies in their cooperation         with universal (and thus eternal) narratives of desire in which their         meaning is determined by male attention and approval, not their own, differing         values or desires. I argued that Riding's poem exposed the women's concealment         under their socially expected roles as a deliberate choice and that, in         exchange for meeting outwardly the expectations of the male eye, Chloe         and Lil gained access to literary and historical narratives that their         silences could confuse and perhaps burst with the unspoken. Their refusal         to overstep "the fatal sill" and comment openly on the artificiality of         the narratives in which they live affords them an inscrutable existence         that keeps Death, another male suitor, "like all the others, guessing."         Like Irigaray's idea of <i>mimicry, </i>I argued, Chloe and Lil's knowingly         exaggerated embrace of their roles wordlessly subverts the very scripts         they enact. &#9;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;As the         high-modernist scripts directing their identities dictate, women stand         opposed to true culture or become disembodied as artistic muses. In a         typical Riding paradox, Chloe and Lils &quot;refus[al] to see anything         distressing&quot; in their social-historical situation both confirms modernisms         narrow categories for femininity and thwarts the modernist quest to illustrate         the spiritual ruin effected by the industrial, consumer age. Chloe and         Lil decline to acknowledge the decay of culture they are supposed to represent         and their (implied) appropriation of sanctioned emotional scripts for         women positions them uncertainly in the discourses defining them, leaving         a dangerous opening for other meanings to invade. As in much of Ridings         poetry that specifically questions womans representation while taking         the position of extreme advocation (without conceding to parody), &quot;Chloe         Or&quot; exposes the irreconcilable valuations of womans situation in         masculine narratives of Being: While Chloe and Lil have the power to shatter         their images (and with them, the structures of meaning dependent upon         those images), the costume of their false womanhood serves as a shield         to their realization of or desire for that shattering. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;I realize         now that my focus on explaining why Chloe and Lil did not break their         silence and "end an age" so obviously damaging to women had everything         to do with my need to claim for Riding a self-awareness in her use of         sanctioned poetic forms, a self-consciousness that turned the gender politics         of modernism against themselves. Like Chloe and Lil's silence, Riding's         employment of traditional form did not signal submission but a strategy         to infiltrate male territory whose forms intended to contain woman's presence         or keep her out actively. In linking Riding's ostensible submission to         conventional rhyme, stanzas, and line breaks with the un-sounding chosen         by Chloe and Lil, I reestablished the poetic borders Riding's disjunct         images and spare, insistent syntax had begun to erode. I read the silence         in "Chloe Or" under the teleological lens of "why?" The reading I produced         excluded the untoward interpretations of Riding's silence as anti-woman         and put a dent in critical assessments of her poetry as an arduous progression         towards poetic failure manifest most obviously in Riding's own "silence."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In her essay         ":RE:THINKING:LITERARY:FEMINISM: (three essays onto shaky grounds)&quot;         Joan Retallack suggests:</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;"[L]et's         think of how we can amplify the knowledge of/ in our silence, our not         so much <i>non</i>sense as additional or other sense, our <b>im</b>probabilities,         our unintellig<b>a</b>bilities...creating new forms of intelligibility."         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Under         the heading "PROCEDURAL NOTES," which comes near the end of her <i>How         to Do Things With Words, </i>Joan Retallack comments briefly that the         poem "Not a Cage" "is composed from the beginnings and endings of books         [she] was culling from [her] library in the Fall of 1990" (156). Having,         for once, read the book without looking ahead to see how it turned out,         I was pleased to learn what system had produced the poem's lines that         invoked a variety of generic voices and narrative scraps that sometimes         battled, sometimes complemented the lines surrounding them. Not once did         it occur to me to ask why Retallack had chosen to eliminate certain books         from her library or to explain why she used the vaguely violent word "culled"         to describe the selection process. Instead, I considered the brilliant         way in which Retallack had converted waste or excess (whatever determined         the books' removal) into creation, elimination into presence, housekeeping         into poetry. The poem, made up of the ends of discarded books, dilates         and contracts among disparate discourses--stage directions, footnote references,         ominous hints of political insurgents, bits of letters. The silences on         either side of these textual "ends" are foregrounded by the abrupt way         lines emerge out of unknown contexts and are cut off in mid-thought, mid-narrative.         They carry forward then quickly recall the narratives so easily summoned         by even the most syntactically alienated word or the most subtle grammatical         rhythm. Read in combinations suggested only by proximity and my (willing         or unwilling) craving for familiar syntactical patterns, some lines produce         a recognizably private, lyric voice, as in the following:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <dir>             <dir>               <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We                 named you I thought the earth<br>                </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">is                 possible I could not tell<br>                </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">to                 make live and conscious history in common<br>                </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">and                 wake you find yourself among<br>                </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">and                 wake up deep in the fruit (27-28)</font></p>            </dir>          </dir>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Reading         Retallack, I am constantly aware of how I am seeing, how I make up patterns         out of glimpses of sentences and piece them into narratives so dependent         on my provisional choices as reader that I can easily forget the stories         and images I've applied to certain lines from one reading to the next--or         remember and reconstruct them into different combinations. Retallack's         "poethics" invites the reader to "foregroun[d] the arts <i>as</i>, rather         than <i>about,</i> forms of engaged living in medias <i>mess"</i> with         forms that "let the mess shine in" ("Wager" 293). Poethics, or ethics         as poetry, extends an invitation to the reader to create the poem's meaning.         Taking the "poethical wager" includes also a responsibility--and opportunity--to         consider the aesthetic, political, and personal directions my reading         process takes "within the personally actual contexts of poetry: literally,         literally, literally, without gloss, without gloss, without gloss." </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;What         about Retallack's poetry--and the poetry of Gertrude Stein, George Oppen,         Susan Howe, Mina Loy--precludes my readerly impulse towards the "why,"         the gloss, the unwitting separation of the world into the "literal" and         the "real," which always requires a transcription of the poem into language         of the what and the why? Why do I read some writers certain that the imposition         of a narrative that makes "sense" out of its words and its silences would         be both absurd and violent and others, like Riding, into explanations?         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Elsewhere         in Retallack's <i>How To Do Things with Words </i>appears the possible         unpunctuated question, "how not to inscribe yourself in the system you're         opposing / opposing opposable thumbs up to a point of no turn no / not         the turn to oppose to it all" (64). Attention to the site of (some) writing,         the thumb and forefinger, flickers here and throughout the book and attends         the recurring issue of un-doing / un-saying: &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;         . . . one might </font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <dir>             <dir>               <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">be                 moved to ask just what is the Greek word for unnailing<br>                </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">i.e.                 quite specifically removal of Christ from<br>                </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the                 cross there will always be many other specialized vo-<br>                </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">cabularies                 . . .

And if it were possible to un-do, un-know,         un-say, what different silences might their un-sounding create? </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Retallack's         poethics lead me to reassess the ways in which form encourages readings         that open meanings (as with Retallack) or that capture them (as in the         case of Riding) and to reconsider the function(s) of silence, announced         or implicit. The silence following the "Or" of Riding's title, for example,         cracks open the dualistic logic that views Chloe and Lil as interchangeable         as it comments on it. Choosing to read Riding as I read Retallack, to         swerve away from "why" and into "how," the many, conflicting silences         of Riding's poetry--"between, after, even <i>within</i> the words"--become         audible, and I begin to participate more actively in the formal experimentalism         of writers, like Retallack, whose work teaches, as it demonstrates, ways         of reading the un-asked, un-said, un-noticed in all forms of writing ("Wager"         295). Poethical practice means a deliberate abandonment of centralized         authority over the poem's meaning: in the protean reading strategy proposed         by Retallack, writing and reading are inseparable acts that re-value by         retaining the radicality of any poem because it is always already new,         never finished. Retallack's poethics give me a way of saying what I already         know: that every act of reading changes what I read--that there is no         reading that does not take place through other writings that are themselves         readings. That poetic lineages are always running both ways and in many         directions at once. Let the mess shine in. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Reading         Riding the way I read Retallack will be a move away from the opposing         criteria of (high) modernism and new criticism to un-limiting, opposable         (but not necessarily oppositional) codes "both rational and arbitrary"         of poethical criticism (73). To (re)read Riding poethically, suspending         the assumption that the poem has one meaning a skilled reader can gather         up and transport to the next, requires unlearning a great deal about literary         criticism--especially for someone who has never before used "I" in a critical         paper. Can I un-learn? If "every form--old or new--has its poethical matrices         and consequences" ("Wager" 302), can the orderly "I-less"ness of academic         critical forms render legible (without neutralizing) the transformative         powers of feminist poethics? And finally, what might this abdication mean         in the classroom, so often caught in the loop of accismus wherein teachers         at first pretend not to have but ultimately produce the secret decoder         ring that unlocks the poem's meaning? Instead of negating the professorial         function that new criticism legitimized, could the newly-reconsidered         importance of the reader's actions not provide the best rationale of all         for creating highly skilled readers?</font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Works         Cited</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Jackson,         Laura (Riding). <i>The Poems of Laura Riding</i>.
