Mix</font></p>      <p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>      <br>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In         her essay &quot;Strangeness,&quot; Lyn Hejinian looks to an aesthetic         that she terms &quot;a poetics of description&quot; and distinguishes         from &quot;after-the-fact-realism, with its emphasis on the world described&quot;         and from &quot;an organizing subjectivity (that of the perceiver-describer)&quot;         (32). Instead, this poetics aims &quot;toward objectifying all thats         described and making it strange&quot; through the use of metonymy (32).         Where metaphor creates a kind of prison-house of language -- &quot;If         words matched their things wed be imprisoned within walls of symmetry&quot;         (My Life 70) -- metonymy does just the opposite. &quot;Metonymy moves         attention from thing to thing; its principle is combination rather than         selection. Compared to metaphor, which depends on code, metonym preserves         context, foregrounds interrelationship&quot; (&quot;Strangeness&quot;         38). Thus, rather than a straightforward comparison and congruence between         elements, Hejinian creates a shifting and constantly restructuring relationship         between elements. Such an operation is, she argues, &quot;not definitive         but transformative . . . . at once improvisational and purposive&quot;         (&quot;Strangeness&quot; 32).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;This         combination of &quot;induction and deduction&quot; (&quot;Strangeness&quot;         32) allows, in fact requires, a kind of participatory playfulness from         both the readers and the author (who is herself a &quot;reader&quot; of         her text). They must, therefore, acknowledge and remain conscious at all         times of their own roles as constructors and makers of meaning -- both         by interpreting the text and by creating its subject(s). By highlighting         the readers power as constitutors of meaning(s), and by attending to         the ways in which identity is provisional, dependent on myriad changeable         elements of time, place, and reader, the metonymic text offers an alternative         way for thinking about meaning and identity and thus about individual         agency -- the power of reading itself is reconstructed as a way of intervening         in the world beyond the text.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&quot;Supposing         a sentence to be clear whose is it&quot; (148), Gertrude Stein muses in         &quot;Sentences.&quot; Peter Quartermain notes that a phrase like this         one puts into question &quot;the readers possession of meaning, for in         rendering inaccessible to the reader the customary contract with the author         as authority it undermines the readers sense of his/her own certainty         as arbiter of the meaning of the text&quot; (23). In this kind of writing,         readers must attend to each individual word, to the cultural (hi)stories         trailing along behind them, and, ultimately, as Rachel Blau DuPlessis         explains, readers can choose either to &quot;reaffirm the narrative(s)         the word is telling or can try to break into by distorting or deforming,         opening the storied words&quot; (144).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Like         Stein, Hejinian is also interested in &quot;distorting or deforming, opening         the storied words&quot; to encourage a different way of reading and therefore         thinking. In one of her earliest works, <i>Writing Is an Aid to Memory,</i>         she muses on the power of authorial and readerly expectations, tracing         some of the same pathways as Stein. &quot;that sweet little block / the         taste of a larger pattern&quot; emerges from time to time, appearing only         to disappear back into &quot;tired mixed trace of chat bac&quot; (this         volume is not paginated). &quot;the readymade is deceptively passing /its         consent to time,&quot; she writes, &quot;mass perhaps in a form against         it / a cheap reading of what surrounds.&quot; Here Hejinian asks readers         to reflect on their practices of reading, their desires for the &quot;taste         of a larger pattern.&quot; And while she seems respectful of that desire         (in fact she admits to having it herself), she is also wary of it. Our         &quot;readymade&quot; expectations are &quot;deceptive.&quot; If we enter         a text carelessly, without an awareness of our potential prejudices or         proclivities, were likely to seize on those elements we seek, those that         are already familiar to us, those that fit neatly into our own critical         patterns, resulting in a &quot;cheap reading of what surrounds.&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;An intimacy         marks Hejinians work, a willingness to experiment with writing and reading         that encourages a kind of faithfulness and commitment from reader and         writer. Hejinian writes, &quot;love writes our enjoyment in length / no         more pretends to return to a simple utterance&quot; (<i>Writing</i>).         The kind of singularity of interpretation that Hejinians work elicits         leads to a sense of intimacy, a sense that the reader is taking this text         in a new and utterly unique direction. Like the discovery of a new lovers         body or mind, each reader creates the text anew. In fact, each reading         creates the text anew. As I looked through <i>Writing is an Aid to Memory</i>         again and again, I found myself making new links, noticing different resonances,         puzzling over passages marked in earlier readings. Yet each new reading         is inviting, exciting, awakening a &quot;corner hope of smaller sharp         faithfulness.&quot; Because the subject, the plot, the usual markers of         the literary text are unavailable here, the reader cannot approach Hejinian         from a distant point outside the text with her aim being to master that         text. Instead, the text invites a lively and individual participation         in its creation, making the reader an equal partner in the writing of         the text. &quot;I wish to make you do so for joy,&quot; Hejinian writes,         calling attention to the intimate give and take of the text. As such,         then, the reader subverts the kinds of hegemonic hierarchies that feminists         and multiculturalist critics have worked to highlight and deconstruct.         Hierarchies, which many critics have illustrated are built into language         itself, are undone through the kinds of linguistic and formal strategies         I have discussed. She even gently mocks these kinds of hierarchies: &quot;written         of perfection repeats / is bulky / maybe peanut butter would be better,&quot;         suggesting instead that &quot;pleasant mistakes are good to hear in romances,&quot;         referring perhaps to the romance between writer and reader, reader and         text, or some other grouping that allows for the kinds of risk-taking         that Hejinian's work encourages. As an antidote of sorts to the push to         perfection, to resolved readings, to hierarchical mastery, Hejinian offers         what she calls &quot;wicker grammar,&quot; &quot;like a fillet extremely         fine / nishment of finery / such ceived ket-weaving / rabbit in all /         dust or gores shape be next than goes and grounds / whence wicker.&quot;         As weavers of the text, Hejinian's and her readers create intricate patterns         that are both sturdy and delicate, always calling attention to their own         artifice, to their fragility, to their holes.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Throughout         <i>Writing Is an Aid to Memory</i>, Hejinian gently pulls her readers         away from &quot;glue [that] is used on almost all occasions that are to         be / joined / to draw tendencies into truths of such / a link&quot; and         directs them instead toward &quot;a vulnerable known not sure&quot; that         &quot;suits my suspicions.&quot; &quot;a small wonder is an understanding,&quot;         she says, seeming to recognize the ways in which a reader might approach         her writing. Yet she turns that comment back on itself, asking whether         the so-called understanding represents &quot;recognizing patterns or pruning         the truth?&quot; As a reader moves through Hejinians texts, she will         find numerous resonances. The reader who seeks a particular kind of resonance         may not be disappointed, but that reader must, at the same time as she         congratulates herself on finding a connection, consider her own role in         constructing a pattern. As I thought of the potential relationships between         Hejinian and Stein, for instance, I found lines such as &quot;one glass         the whole will grouping&quot; and the promise that &quot;the digressions         is a tender essential&quot; to remind me of Steins <i>Tender Buttons</i>         and her &quot;carafe that is a blind glass.&quot; Yet I was keenly aware         that these were my connections predicated on my interests. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;These         patterns often hinge on repetitions in the texts, repeated words and phrases         that appear again and again, in varying contexts. Rosemarie Waldrop notes         that, while we often associate repetition with stasis, it can also work         to &quot;suggest change and growth&quot; (220). Readers are encouraged         to draw upon their own resources of memory and association to create meanings         predicated on accretion and combination. Hejinian explains in her essay         &quot;The Rejection of Closure&quot; that repetition necessarily creates         recontextualization. &quot;Since context is never the same and never stops,         this device says that meaning is always in flux, always in the process         of being created. Repetition, and the rewriting that repetition becomes,         make a perpetual beginning, like Steins beginning again and again; they         postpone completion indefinitely&quot; (273).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Rather than         representing hermetic, closed systems of meaning, repetition in Hejinians         poetry recalls the concentric circles rippling out from a pebble dropped         into a pond, ripples that alter the surfaces around them as, to borrow         a phrase from Stein, their difference spreads (see <i>Tender Buttons</i>).         Hejinians most well known work, <i>My Life</i>, provides an example of         the way in which such ripples can move throughout a (reading of a) text.         Each of the books sections includes a kind of epigraph, a short line         like, &quot;A pause, a rose, something on paper&quot; (7). Each of these         epigraphs reappears throughout the text, each new appearance creating         a new set of &quot;ripples.&quot; In the first section, for instance,         the phrase seems to resonate with the line &quot;Somewhere, in the background,         rooms share a pattern of small roses&quot; (7). This phrase might suggest         an echo of Steins <i>Tender Buttons</i>, with its section of &quot;Rooms&quot;;         one might think also (or instead) of a pattern of small roses on (wall)paper         that one pauses to notice; one might wonder whether the &quot;small pattern&quot;         (two mentions of roses so close together) will repeat (as in wallpaper)         or whether the &quot;small pattern&quot; is illusory. As the phrase recurs         throughout the text, however, the &quot;small pattern&quot; appears to         grow, but without a clear repeat, offering a reminder to readers to ask         themselves whether they are, to return to an aforementioned passage, &quot;recognizing         patterns or pruning the truth.&quot; &quot;A pause, a rose, something         on paper implicit in the fragmentary text&quot; (41). &quot;A pause, a         rose, something on paper, of true organic spirals we have no lack&quot;         (65). Each repetition leads to a new disruption of meaning, a shift in         the surface tension of the text. As individual words appear in different         sentences (&quot;The symbolism of the rose depends on its purity of color&quot;         [65]; &quot;The symbolism of the rose depends on its thorns&quot; [66];         &quot;What is the gender on paper&quot; [76]), readers begin to sense         that &quot;Long time lines trail behind every idea, object, person, pet,         vehicle, and event&quot; (7).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Through         the recognition of such &quot;time lines,&quot; recognition that both         Hejinian and Stein encourage through their use of repetition and metonymic         movement, reading as transformation becomes possible. If we choose to         note the lateral movement of words, meaning, identity, then we can let         go of a sense of &quot;originary&quot; status as primary, and thus relinquish         the stasis of the &quot;phallogocentric monumentality&quot; (Hejinian,         &quot;Two&quot; 132). Similarly, through the recognition that all kinds         of nouns, from ideas to people to cars, bear trails, the construction         of hierarchies becomes not just unnecessary but impossible. Hejinian explains,         &quot;To regard description -- or a page of writing -- as a container         [is] to betray the nature of the thing described, the flow of its existence,         and the flow of the consciousness perceiving it&quot; (&quot;Two&quot;         133). It is, for both Stein and Hejinian, the recognition of such trails,         rather than the codifying of them, that is important. The title <i>Tender         Buttons</i> itself points toward this kind of fluid, lateral exchange         of meaning as the &quot;Buttons&quot; might be taken to refer to traditional         buttons (words as fasteners, making connections), sexual buttons (clitoral         pleasure, physical/intellectual stimulation), or even buttons as a system         of value (transferring meaning, &quot;legal tender&quot;); likewise &quot;tender&quot;         might be an invocation of gentleness, exchange, significance. Stein writes         in the first &quot;poem&quot; of <i>Tender Buttons</i> of &quot;A Carafe,         That Is A Blind Glass&quot;: &quot;A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle         and nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangment in a system         to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling.         The difference is spreading&quot; (461). Through repetition (infinite         drops of liquid meaning), which, while suggesting homogeneity (an inseparable         &quot;mass&quot; of wine) is actually always already different (heterogenous         drops of wine), both Stein and Hejinian are pointing to &quot;the possibility         of a variation on . . . repetition,&quot; a potential &quot;resignification         and redeployment&quot; that Judith Butler argues is the key to claiming         agency (Butler 145). Metonymy and repetition, then, suggest a way in which         both authors and readers might take charge of a transformative power inherent         in &quot;spectacle&quot;: the act of seeing and reading into, out of,         through, beside, with.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The first         sentence of Steins &quot;Sentences&quot; offers a way to understand what         it is that Stein and Hejinian are offering to their readers: &quot;A sentence         is made by coupling meanwhile ride around to be a couple there makes grateful         dubiety named atlas coin in a loan&quot; (115). Each sentence is made         not merely by a single author, not just by Stein or by Hejinian. Rather,         the sentences are created through the coupling, the intimacy of author         and reader as they &quot;ride around&quot; any piece of writing. This         imagine of &quot;riding around&quot; on sentences marks not just the collaborative         element of this reading practice but also its playfulness and antilinearity         -- the reader is not just permitted but encouraged to wander, to circle         back, to move in and out of the text. The text itself becomes &quot;coin         in a loan,&quot; a kind of material exchange of language. We dont know         who is loaning coin to whom here, suggesting that it is not to be kept         permanently by any one person, but rather is a circulating text, moving         back and forth across the atlas. And both writer and reader are free to         act with &quot;grateful dubiety,&quot; a pleasurable doubtfulness. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;It is         in this &quot;opportunity to doubt,&quot; to doubt not only our own authority         as critics but also Stein and Hejinians authority as writers, that we         are freed to reenvision our practices of reading and writing and thus         to reimagine the ways that we both read and write the world around us.         Rather than try to fill those gaps, to quiet that dubiety, we are left         with what Hejinian calls &quot;Reluctance such that it cant be filled&quot;         (<i>Writing</i>). Nor should it be since it is this reluctance, this self-awareness,         that is so rich with possibility.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Works         Cited</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Butler,         Judith. <i>Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity</i>.         New York: Routledge, &#9;1990.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">DuPlessis,         Rachel Blau. &quot;Otherhow.&quot; <i>The Pink Guitar: Writing as Feminist         Practice</i>.
