For a start, although McGuckian insists in her interview         with Susan Shaw Sailer that her work is "almost totally autobiographic"         (113), this collection's dedication ("for my mother / without my father")         may be read metaphorically as demonstrating a strong orientation toward         female literary ancestors. In fact, this volume shelters a world of women:         aunts, sisters, mothers, grandmothers, frustrated governesses, wet nurses,         even Beatrix Potter and Mary Queen of Scots (in "Mr. McGregor's Garden"         and "The Heiress," respectively). Many poems invoke McGuckian's ambivalence         toward those women; "The Mother," for example, depicts the title character         as natural yet confined, familiar yet incomprehensible. "Fossils," strongly         echoing the imagery of Marianne Moore's "The Paper Nautilus," focuses         a "straightened gaze" at McGuckian's apparently sterile, androgynous predecessors         with a similar mixture of awe and reprimand. Laura O'Connor comments that         both Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill and McGuckian rely on "the enabling myth of the         disabling mother," citing "hostile, rather than nurturant, mothering"         as their impetus to art (McGuckian and Ni Dhomhnaill 609-10). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;This         biographical observation applies well to McGuckian's treatment of this         female modernist legacy. In particular, several factors connect <i>The         Flower Master</i> with another first collection, H.D.'s <i>Sea Garden</i>         (1916), divided as these books are both temporally and geographically.         Both volumes express their concerns with literary and sexual fertility         largely through flower imagery: each describes a garden whose particular         beauties define the poet's esthetic project, and each manipulates flower         imagery in original ways to comment on the meanings of femininity. In         fact, both collections mention flowers, plants, fruits or seeds in every         poem but one ("The Wind Sleepers" in H.D. and "The `Singer'" in McGuckian).         Thomas Docherty has cited Baudelaire's <i>Flowers of Evil</i> as an influence         on the Irish poet's project, but both the similarities in subject between         the volumes and certain allusions within individual poems suggest that         <i>The Flower Master</i> is also rooted in H.D.'s groundbreaking book,         although largely repudiating its predecessor's approach. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;While         McGuckian seems to allude to Anglo-American modernism, and occasional         ecstasies in her poems (such as "Smoke") do suggest <i>Sea Garden's</i>         pursuits of the divine, for the most part the Belfast-born poet sounds         drastically unlike the Pennsylvania native. The geographically loyal McGuckian         enmeshes her speakers in family relationships; in contrast, the expatriate         American wanders alone or with a band of initiates along an apparently         Greek coastline. McGuckian's tone is often discursive or wry, her free-verse         lusher than H.D.'s spare, short lines, although both value image over         clear statement; certainly the former's cryptic pieces seem at least as         coded as any imagist fragment. Finally, McGuckian claims a value, or at         least a tolerance, for inherited notions of womanliness that H.D. critiques         sharply throughout her work. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         likenesses and differences between these books and these writers emerge         through a close look at the title poem of <i>The Flower Master</i> in         relation to H.D.'s <i>Sea Garden</i>. "The Flower Master" particularly         revises "Sheltered Garden," a poem that provides the antithesis to H.D.'s         title image. "Sheltered Garden" implicitly describes the discipline of         conventional femininity in withering terms, preferring the dangers of         the sea's harsh weather to carefully tended flowers screened by garden         walls. H.D.'s poem desires escape from confined Victorian womanhood to         modern sexual liberation. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In contrast,         "The Flower Master" deliberately embraces a similar sheltered space. The         poem's first-person plural speaker obediently engages in her lessons:         "we come to terms with shade, with the principle / of enfolding space."         In fact, the immediate "master" of the poem seems to be neither Baudelaire         nor H.D. but a teacher of ikebana, instilling the principles of Japanese         floral arrangement. Stella Coe, in her study of ikebana, uses the term         "flower master" itself to refer to an expert in this discipline (22),         and McGuckian's references to the Japanese festival of moon-viewing and         to the tea ceremony confirm the allusion. "The Flower Master"'s students         learn how to bend seasonally appropriate plants into designs, and create         the symbolic correspondences which this art often suggests. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         meditative function of ikebana, in fact, illuminates the entire collection         in interesting ways. Directing would-be practitioners, Coe writes, "the         way to proceed is to let your insight guide you. You want a direct, non-analytic         expression of the theme in the simplest terms possible" (129). McGuckian         has described her poetic purposes as follows: "I just wanted to get the         experience, or the meaning of the experience, not the experience itself,         because the experience itself was nothing...I just hope that other women         can reach into it and feel that their own life was somehow ordinary enough         to be reflected there" ("Interview" 112, 115). Her works rarely present         clear situations, coherent speakers, or consistent narratives; their purposes         remain oblique, so that the poems can resemble little tokonamas enshrining         their evocatively arranged sprays. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Even         so, "The Flower Master"'s very allusions to ikebana intersect with the         poem's modernist lineage. McGuckian's speaker studies under "the school         of the grass moon," a translation of Sogetsu-ryu. Although ikebana originated         as a masculine discipline performed by priests, noblemen, and warriors,         recent centuries democratized the pursuit and created new versions (Coe         22-3). Sogetsu, founded in the 1920s, "has a wide following both in and         outside Japan, possibly because it is the most easily translated into         the language of other cultures." It emphasizes individuality and originality         in creating arrangements; its founder, Sofu Teshigahara, has been called         "the Picasso of ikebana" (Coe 23). These dates and qualities coincide         roughly with the innovations of imagism, the modernist movement arising         in part from H.D.'s early poems, and advocating an elegantly minimal free         verse. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Though         embracing rather than rejecting bowers, "The Flower Master" does share         some qualities and images with "Sheltered Garden," just as the larger         volumes correspond in certain points. Each eroticizes its garden; the         students in the contemporary poem, for instance, "stroke gently the necks         of daffodils / and make them throw their heads back to the sun," and collect         plants with suggestive names like "sweet / sultan, dainty nipplewort."         McGuckian's "sea-fans with sea-lavender" invoke H.D.'s many sea-flowers,         and both poems suggest an autumnal mood, H.D. through ripening fruit and         McGuckian through the mid-September festival of moon-viewing. These similarities,         however, frame the essentially contrary stands the poems adopt. Placing         her "scissors in brocade," eschewing the wild breakage H.D. imagines,         McGuckian's speaker espouses gentleness and tradition. Even the form of         "The Flower Master" resists its predecessor's. McGuckian avoids symmetry         and creates a tripartite arrangement in loyalty to ikebana's esthetics         (these Japanese arrangements consist of three main lines), but she also         returns to meters the imagists eschewed (Coe 43). "The Flower Master"         adheres to a rough pentameter, irregularly rhymed, while "Sea Garden"         depends for its rebellious music on jaggedly uneven lines and verses.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;McGuckian         is no formalist, and her experiments certainly build on the "papery legacies,"         as "The Flower Master" puts it, of previous women poets including H.D.         However, the differences between these two prominently titled poems suggest         how widely their attitudes toward gender diverge. While H.D. celebrates         a harsh, androgynous beauty, "The Flower Master" thrives in sheltered         space and admires the delicacy of its shade-loving specimens. While "Mid-Day,"         the fourth poem in<i> Sea Garden,</i> laments "hot shrivelled seeds" scattered         over pavement in a strong image of writer's block and/or miscarriage (CP         10), McGuckian's collection seethes with fertility, depicting numerous         crowded, feminine houses and greenhouses; collecting various nests, seeds,         and children; citing moons and milk-fevers. "My womb is almost my brain,"         McGuckian has declared ("Interview" 121), identifying her literary inspiration         with her reproductive function, insisting on the femaleness of her writing         as deliberately as H.D. adhered to those ambiguous initials. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Patricia         Haberstroh aptly reads McGuckian in light of ecriture feminine (124-5).         Certainly these poems are deeply rooted in female sexuality; they also,         as reviewers Tim Dooley and Christopher Benfred have noted, align themselves         with decorative crafts and domestic places deeply associated with women         in nineteenth and twentieth century Western culture. In her published         conversation with Gaelic poet Ni Dhomhnaill, McGuckian speaks of multiple         experiences with sexual discrimination and laments the absence of women         authors in her coursework, and in an earlier interview she states her         aspirations for equality of opportunity for women. However, she quickly         qualifies her identification with feminism: </font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You             know, if you're too demanding for your freedom then you are going             to destroy your home. I'm for feminism as long as it doesn't destroy             in woman what is the most precious to her, which is her ability to             relate and soften and make a loving environment for others as well             as herself...Sometimes there is something in feminism that demands             you to be almost </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">masculine             and that's what frightens me a bit about it, or to sort of repudiate             reproduction...I find feminism attractive in theory but in practice             I think it ends up influenced by lesbians and very lonely and embittered             and stressed and full of hatred. (Sailer 121)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">McGuckian's         homophobia illuminates even her literary differences with H.D. The Irish         writer's program for contemporary poetry seems to be a recuperation of         essential femininity, in reaction to how key modernist women undertook         marriage and motherhood: bisexual H.D. married and bore a daughter, but         her marriage quickly shattered and she raised her child in an unconventional         way; Moore's sexuality remains ambiguous. "Poets of this generation,"         theorizes McGuckian about her own contemporaries, "are the pioneers of         women who've survived birth, survived multiple births, in order to write         about it. And maintained the marriage relationship. I think the complexities         of holding all these irons in the fire and keeping your inwardness intact         are immeasurable" (McGuckian and Ni Dhomhnaill 606). In <i>The Flower         Master</i>, McGuckian inverts H.D.'s central gesture of divorcing womanhood         from domesticity, but even in so doing the former declares her debt to         <i>Sea Garden's</i> scenes, vocabulary, and erotic passion. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Works         Cited</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Benfrey,         Christopher. <i>Parnassus: Poetry in Review</i>. 12.2 and 13.1</font>         <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(1985): 500-12.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Coe, Stella.         <i>Ikebana: A Practical and Philosophical Guide to Japanese Flower &#9;Arrangement</i>.         Woodstock NY: Overlook P, 1984.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Docherty,         Thomas.
