        Margins and Subversions</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;When 
        we turn our feminist attention to Modernist poetic communities both here 
        and abroad, a gender politics devastating to women poets emerges. When 
        it comes to poetic production, we see women at once marginalized imaginatively, 
        set in a metaphorized relation vis a vis male poets (the feminine as a 
        locus of male fantasies and fears, etc.), and also materially, at a certain 
        distance to the processes and products of these movements of &quot;the 
        new.&quot; In the production of poetry and poetic manifestoes and other 
        such directives, men reign (though Mina Loy obviously took exception to 
        the rule). And when we look to the publication (reproduction) of these 
        texts, we might remember the various pots Ezra Pound had a hand in, editorially 
        intervening upon Dora Marsden’s <i>The Egoist</i> (1914-19), n&eacute;e 
        <i>The New Freewoman</i> (1913), Harriet Monroe’s <i>Poetry</i> (1912-1936) 
        and Margaret Anderson’s <i>The Little Review</i> (1914-1929). Marianne 
        Moore edited <i>The Dial</i> from 1925-1929 and while many histories of 
        Moore’s editorship cast her in the margins of her own presumed lack of 
        self-confidence (thus was construed her consultations with her &quot;senior&quot; 
        editors Scofield Thayer and James Sibley Watson) she might be viewed rather 
        as a central operative figure maintaining correspondence out of a sense 
        of (institutional and personal) respect. Certainly documentary evidence, 
        and the initiative she took in reinstating The Dial’s relationship with 
        then-estranged foreign correspondent Pound and in encouraging, in reviews 
        and through publication, the work of Gertrude Stein, suggests that rather 
        than being in some aspect marginal to modernist poetic production, or 
        forced to the margins of editorial initiative at The Dial, she chose rather 
        to be absorbed in what Jayne Marek has calls the collective &quot;Editorial 
        We&quot; -- a somewhat uncategorizable, because non-centric yet non-marginal, 
        position. Vexatious to literary historians. Women editors pushed into 
        the poetic margins of their own print productions. And in poetic productions, 
        even Pound’s heralded few -- H.D. and Mina Loy, e.g. -- subsequently were 
        marginalized/excized in acts of scholarly concision. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Feminist 
        scholarship, in recovering the works of these and other women writers, 
        has tended toward &quot;subversion&quot; as an axis, as a point of location, 
        a &quot;gynesis&quot; whereby women could be seen at work in and on the 
        field of traditionally masculine poetic production. Subverting lyric gender 
        ideologies, subverting/scattering unified subjectivity, subverting &quot;other&quot; 
        into the &quot;New woman&quot; subject (i.e. Mina Loy, 1917); subverting 
        poetic production so that it might both contain her and destroy the container. 
        Though modernists writers were highly suspicious of metaphor women continued 
        to write under the symbol &quot;Woman.&quot; The path was, from the margins, 
        symbolic subversion; the rest is herstory.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Of the 
        Field of Poetic Production</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In the 
        recently published anthology<u> </u><i>Moving Borders: Three Decades of 
        Innovative Writing by Women</i>, editor Mary Margaret Sloan’s organizing 
        principal locates the field of production as an important context to our 
        understanding of contemporary innovative poetry. Rather than ordering 
        contributors by birthdate, she signifies &quot;entry into the public domain 
        of a literary or arts community&quot;(7), by relying on publishing chronology 
        -- paying heed to the role the small press has played in the dissemination 
        of innovative writing. A theory of such a context is developed in Pierre 
        Bourdieu’s <i>The Field of Cultural Production</i>: &quot;The literary 
        or artistic field is a field of forces, but it is also a field of struggles 
        tending to transform or conserve this field of forces.&quot; I’m not so 
        much concerned with &quot;the specific profits (such as literary prestige) 
        which are at stake in the field&quot;(30), i.e. not so concerned with 
        the fact that by taking a position in the field one puts oneself in proximity 
        with said profits. For Bourdieu the field of production is a site of hierarchical 
        struggle between the &quot;heteronomous principal&quot; (the bourgeois 
        state) and the &quot;autonomous principal&quot; (the anti-bourgeois avant-garde), 
        and thus the bottom line is economic, a &quot;struggle in the field of 
        cultural production over the imposition of the legitimate modes of cultural 
        production&quot; which is inseparably a &quot;struggle within the dominant 
        class&quot;(41). This is simply, in small press production at this moment, 
        not the issue. Also of little immediate interest are the effects innovators 
        taking positions in the field of production enact on genre, though there 
        has been, and continues to be, much to be said. This latter is the project 
        of feminist scholarship -- endeavoring to position one or another marginalized 
        woman poet into her justified position in the field. I’m concerned with 
        what I might perhaps call sub-genre, with the poetic practices that are 
        introduced into the field, and which consequently signify a certain sort 
        of poetic production (i.e. &quot;formal,&quot; &quot;innovative,&quot; 
        &quot;experimental&quot; etc.), and that are taken up as a sign of entry 
        into the field. And I’m especially concerned with this as a particularly 
        gendered position-taking, evident in the women-edited small press phenomena 
        that has, since the 1950s, changed the field of innovative poetic production.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since 1953 
        ( when Daisy Aldan began co-editing <i>Folder</i>, a major outlet for 
        New York avant-garde poets and artists, with Richard Miller, and continuing 
        through the sixties as Diane di Prima, Margaret Randall, Rosmarie Waldrop, 
        Anne Waldman and Bernadette Mayer co-edited little magazines and small 
        presses (usually with a husband or lover) -- women poet-editors have started 
        over 70 such ventures devoted to innovative poetry, almost half of these 
        since 1990 alone. In endeavoring to edit and publish a little magazine, 
        one enacts a position-taking that is qualitatively different than the 
        sort of positioning one makes in writing poetry or being published. Since 
        literary historians look largely to (and selectively through) written 
        documentation, recognition amongst one’s contemporaries without representation 
        in contemporary print production is tantamount to erasure. Devoted to 
        furthering innovative explorations, a woman poet-editor enacts a feminist 
        poetic by inserting her editorial agenda and making editorial decisions 
        that effect the poetic community. Representation is not a byproduct of 
        the politics of poetic practice, but a co-production. Her activity recasts 
        the field of poetic production to include a wider variety of practices 
        (and practitioners). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Post-Marginal 
        Animadversions</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Though there 
        are undoubtedly fewer women than men involved in innovative poetry and 
        poetics, I hesitate to maintain &quot;marginal&quot; as a position-marker. 
        The recent conference at Barnard (&quot;Where Lyric and Language Meet: 
        Innovation in Contemporary Poetry by Women&quot;) and symposium at Bard’s 
        Institute of Thinking and Writing attest to the centrality of women poets 
        and poet-critics in the imagining of the field of innovative poetic production. 
        In numbers, young contemporary women poet-editors nearly match the bulk 
        of their male cohorts. It’s not merely coincident that these same are 
        also post-Language and thus partaking of those theories of poetic invention 
        and intervention that took shape in the establishment of a now vital small 
        press community. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Against 
        a backdrop of prohibitive literary history, asserting one’s editorial 
        position, as well as writing and agreeing to have one’s work read and 
        published -- insomuch as these amount to an exercise of agency -- is a 
        feminist undertaking. The appearance of women writers and editors upset 
        the prevalence of a set of top-heavy relations (subject/object, speaker/listener, 
        viewer/viewed) and served to fully deconstruct the hegemonic order of 
        feminist realism and masculinist innovation that preceded it. But where 
        previously the struggle was unmistakably gendered, now it is unclear how 
        gender functions in the production of innovative poetry and poetics. Bourdieu: 
        &quot;the field of cultural production is the site of struggles in which 
        what is a stake is the power to impose the dominant definition of the 
        writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take 
        part in the struggle to define the writer&quot;(42). Since the birth of 
        feminist literary scholarship, but especially since the 1980s, the struggle 
        has been to &quot;consecrate,&quot; to unearth, modernist women writers 
        and to legitimate their writing practices as poetic practices -- to deem 
        their various modes of writing as poetry -- and as engaged also in the 
        &quot;more important&quot; issues at hand in the public sphere, to say 
        for example that Emily Dickinson, George Eliot, and Gertrude Stein are 
        not &quot;merely&quot; domestic writers. The struggle also has been to 
        legitimize contemporary poetic practices as poetry (cf. <i>How(ever)</i>) 
        and to turn critical response to those practices: to shape (and gender) 
        reception, to shape (and gender) those practices, to shape and gender 
        the field of poetic production. To wit: much work reproduced in the &quot;Poetics 
        and Exposition&quot; segment of <i>Moving Borders</i> was produced in 
        the 1980s, such as Rachel Blau DuPlessis’ &quot;Otherhow,&quot; Lyn Hejinian’s 
        &quot;Rejection of Closure,&quot; Susan Howe’s <i>My Emily Dickinson </i>and 
        Leslie Scalapino’s &quot;Note on my writing, 1985.&quot; The value of 
        women’s writing to the field of poetic production is positively defined.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Bourdieu: 
        &quot;Position taking changes, even when the position remains identical, 
        whenever there is a change in the universe of options that are simultaneously 
        offered for producers and consumers to choose from. The meaning of a work 
        . . . changes automatically with each change in the field within which 
        it is situated for spectator or reader&quot;(30). What does &quot;innovative&quot; 
        feminist work by a contemporary mean? A younger poet taking up the available 
        poetic practices enacts a radical derealization of their once-politic 
        effects, for the newly constructed poem fails to realize (make real) the 
        political potential with which the strategy was introduced. &quot;Ignorance 
        of everything which goes to make up the ‘mood of the age’ produces a derealization 
        of the works: stripped of everything which attached them to the most concrete 
        debates of their time . . . they are impoverished and transformed in the 
        direction of intellectualism or empty humanism&quot; or what appears to 
        be the new unified subject; the anti-subject subject who from the fractures 
        emerges whole. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;How 
        to talk about this new (feminist?) subject? At a point when innovative 
        women poets are no longer marginal, does it make sense to speak of subversion 
        as a poetic tactic? Or a poetic trinket? Is gender still a relevant for 
        locating subversive (or not) poetic practices by women? It remains, indeed, 
        a crucial question for existence on a material, daily level. To be clear: 
        the frame or the context, that which hinges the ever pervasive metonymies 
        and abstractions, the babes of the New Sentence, is the new metaphor that 
        we might, like moderinsts, be suspicious of. For despite heterogeneous 
        (and anti-hegemonic) poetic practices, a new subject, recognizeable as 
        a unified subject, has re-emerged. Margin and subversion, once-useful 
        points of critique that did frame the problematic have now become subsumed 
        in the frame, have become part of its materials and methods. Once politicized, 
        now aestheticized. Thus having announced one’s affiliation to a certain 
        aesthetic or tradition by taking up a particular set of strategies, announcing, 
        as it were, one’s position in the field of production, the question becomes 
        whether this alignment further politicizes or merely aestheticizes those 
        strategies as &quot;givens.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Bourdieu’s 
        Marxist roots -- as in the lexicon of production and consumption -- will 
        prove, momently, its continued relevance to the situation at hand despite 
        the fact that, as I’ve said, the issue is not &quot;specific profits&quot; 
        (i.e. cultural capital) but, strictly speaking, poetics, as a prescriptive 
        and proscriptive indicator. For what emerges is a new, linguistically 
        coded poetic subject, a sort of hip billboard which is an advertisement 
        for the acquiescence of the subject to hegemony, for which one needs only 
        the decoder technology to read.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;So while 
        the &quot;difficult modernist text&quot; has given way to the possibility 
        of a &quot;difficult but decodable text,&quot; discerning the context 
        of production emerges as the new difficulty; discerning it, to figure 
        out where it has gone awry in relation to specific points of feminist 
        and poetic interest. &quot;When a new literary or artistic group makes 
        its presence felt in the field of literary or artistic production, the 
        whole problem is transformed, since its coming into being, i.e. into difference, 
        modifies and displaces the universe of possible options; the previously 
        dominant productions may, for example, be pushed into the status either 
        of outmoded [<i>d&eacute;class&eacute;</i>] or of classic works&quot;(32). 
        How are these &quot;new&quot; groups (are they?) making their presences 
        felt (are they?). The little magazines used to be the organ of the movement; 
        now the movement, the &quot;new&quot; as an aesthetic, is an organ of 
        the little magazine, and the presence of the multitude produced is felt 
        in proliferation, the whelm of dispersion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In Bourdieu’s 
        field, conflict rather than consensus is the prized outcome. Let it not 
        be assumed that I’m demanding that innovative women’s poetry today enact 
        in practice an effect it presumes in theory. An effect -- feminist or 
        post-feminist -- assumes a historical, political and/or aesthetic relation 
        to a cause, most recently those questions of gender, of representation, 
        of textuality, of subjectivity, of translation, of authorship, that is 
        if we take <i>Moving Borders</i> as an indication of particular, and particularly 
        valued (&quot;innovative&quot;) causes. But rather I’m asking that innovative 
        (women’s) poetry today articulate for itself particular critical points 
        of coherence, conflict, or departure from the rubric constructed by previous 
        poetic endeavors -- to claim a position in the field; and that women critics 
        and poet-critics continue to articulate those points of what might be 
        called feminist intervention in innovative poetic production.</font></p>
