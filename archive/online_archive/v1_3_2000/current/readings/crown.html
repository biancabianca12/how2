For H.D.         and Susan Howe, archival documents are themselves potential witnesses         to traumatic historical events, and both poets attempt to rearticulate         documents that have been lost, mutilated, or destroyed. But they do so         by serving, in some sense, as mediums for an agency that they view as         already residing in the distorted, traumatized, or &quot;murdered&quot;         text. In H.D.s &quot;autobiographical fantasy,&quot; <i>The Gift, </i>the         witnessing narrator relays the contents of a &quot;lost parchment&quot;         recording a peaceful 18th-century encounter between Moravian settlers         and Native Americans. In Susan Howes long poem<i> Articulation of Sound         Forms in Time,</i> the missing document is the Reverend Hope Athertons         account of his involvement in a 17th-century massacre of an encampment         of Native Americans. In both cases, these traumatic events are witnessed         by means of unusual compositional practices that depend on a rhetoric         of ecstasy and &quot;historical possession.&quot; For both Howe and H.D.,         the poetic speaker is &quot;possessed&quot; by inarticulate archival materials         and the historical voices they record.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The testimonial         work of H.D. and Howe thus proposes a kind of &quot;ecstatic historiography,&quot;         and my question above about violence and poetry might be framed as one         about poetic agency: How far can a poet go toward assigning the agential         practice, resistance, and experience of the witness primarily to operations         of language within the material conditions of the text -- especially when         these ur-texts are lost or even nonexistent? Such formulations of the         poet as a receptive medium for outside language and the ghostly voices         of the dead -- &quot;poetry telepathy,&quot; in Howes term --threaten         to obscure the poets active, even salvational, agency in selecting, collecting,         and arranging material. But neither poet subscribes to a poetic practice         in which the poet as passive recipient allows the material to take over         the page. Rather, the poets describe themselves as getting in the way         of outside material -- filtering, editing, and reordering it. Nonetheless,         the &quot;ecstatic historiography&quot; of H.D. and Howe teeters dangerously         between the two poetic subject positions of passive medium and aggressive         agent, and their poetic practice disturbs any neat theoretical division         between them. Their work proposes a conflicted version of agency -- one         that involves a breaking, choosing, editing, or directing process, but         that also involves choosing to serve as an instrument for external (and         linguistic) forces. I will explore the extent to which this ecstatic poetic         method can represent a serious, ethical response to traumatic historical         events.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>H.D.         and Freuds Theory of Trauma</i></font></p>      <dir>         <dir> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I saw,           I understood . . . a memory of my grandmothers or her grandmothers           -- a lost </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">parchment,           terror that led back finally to the savages, burning and poisonous arrows.</font></dir>      </dir>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>           <blockquote>             <blockquote>               <blockquote>                 <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;--                   H.D., <i>The Gift</i> (134)</font></p>              </blockquote>            </blockquote>          </blockquote>        </blockquote>      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;When         H.D. was in analysis with Freud in 1933 and 1934, he was completing his         late work on trauma, <i>Moses and Monotheism,</i> which argued that the         traumatic murder of the father-figure Moses inaugurated both the repression         of the &quot;monotheistic idea&quot; and its inevitable return. These         issues of traumatic history and latency also appear in <i>The Gift,</i>         a memoir of H.D.s Pennsylvania childhood that the poet wrote during the         Second World War. For H.D., &quot;the past [was] literally blasted into         consciousness with the Blitz in London,&quot; when she was composing or,         to use her word, &quot;assembling&quot; <i>The Gift,</i> a landslide of         automatic writing that reflected the dynamited London landscape. In between         writing the last two books of <i>Trilogy,</i> HD put together a prolific,         96-page &quot;Appendix&quot; of historical and genealogical notes to <i>The         Gift.</i> In these Notes, she annotated and interpreted the childhood         terrain upturned both by the trauma of the Second World War and earlier         by her analysis with Freud, as she excavated the phonetic and linguistic         shards from another &quot;apocalyptic&quot; period, eighteenth-century         Americas violent encounters between white settlers and Native Americans.         At the center of H.D.s memoir is a &quot;lost parchment&quot; that records         a peaceful ritual exchange between native peoples and Moravian settlers         in 18th-century Pennsylvania. Although the manuscript was burned and its         copies are lost, its historical knowledge nonetheless possesses a series         of Moravian women (from Anna von Pahlen to Mamalie to the child Hilda)         as an ancestral inheritance or an ecstatic &quot;gift.&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;<i>The         Gift</i> is deeply entangled with Freuds theories of trauma, going so         far as to merge Freuds thesis of father-murder with his well-known anecdote         about a train accident, by which he illustrated the operations of trauma:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It may             happen that someone gets away, apparently unharmed, from the spot             where he has suffered a shocking accident, for instance a train collision.             In the course of the following weeks, however, he develops a series             of grave psychical and motor symptoms, which can be ascribed only             to his shock or whatever else happened at the time of the accident.             He has developed a &quot;traumatic neurosis.&quot; . . . The time             that elapsed between the accident and the first appearance of the             symptoms . . . is the feature one might term latency. </font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In H.D.s         dream logic, the murdered father (representing cultural trauma) is merged         with the train accident (individual trauma) -- the child Hilda discovers         her father with his head severely injured and bloodied after a train accident.         Not only was there an &quot;accident,&quot; but the scene also evokes         the near &quot;murder&quot; of the father, since the child worries, at         first, that he had been assaulted by robbers and left to die. In introducing         this memory, H.D. echoes Freuds discovery that trauma lies in a missed         experience that somehow occurs outside of time, and that &quot;fright&quot;         is caused when something happens so suddenly that one cannot prepare for         it: &quot;What it was,&quot; H.D. writes, &quot;was not appreciable at         the moment. What happened did not take long to happen&quot; (101). The         traumatic appearance of the wounded father becomes entangled, for the         child, with Mamalies traumatic memories of racially motivated violence         in early Pennsylvania: &quot;I got them all mixed up,&quot; H.D.s narrator         tells us, &quot;but I will get them separated again&quot; (100). Mamalies         account of the erasure and recovery of a maternal power and gift -- which         is accompanied by the story of the erasure and return of a &quot;native&quot;         power and vision -- has become confused with a more culturally available         (and Oedipal) &quot;cover story&quot; of the near loss and recovery of         the patriarchal power of the white father.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The memoirs         double trauma (the &quot;cover story&quot; of the fathers near murder,         and the other story or &quot;secret&quot; conveyed by the mothers) takes         shape through a multi-layered compositional process. This unusual writing         and editing process retains traces of the violence done to the original         18th-century parchment, as well as that done to H.D.s own text during         its wartime writing. Like Freuds <i>Moses and Monotheism,</i> H.D.s         text records the trauma of its own creation. The writing of both texts         was interrupted by wartime events, with each author experiencing grave         threats to body and to life and returning to finish the book in a different         frame of mind. The texts traumatic creation has the formal effect, oddly         enough, of removing the author as active agent: &quot;In assembling these         chapters of <i>The Gift</i> during, before and after the worst days of         the 1941 London Blitz,&quot; wrote H.D., &quot;I let the story tell itself         . . . I tried to keep myself out of this&quot; (83). The &quot;Appendix&quot;         of footnotes was prepared a few years after the Blitz, as an explicit         alternative to revision. H.D. wrote in these footnotes that &quot;[i]nstead         of tidying up the body of the narrative, I thought it better to let things         stand as they were (as the story was written under stress of danger and         great emotion)&quot; (MSS 56). When &quot;a friendly critic suggested         a tightening-up of the last section, Morning Star,&quot; H.D. felt that         she &quot;could not rework the threads without spoiling the texture of         the picture&quot; (&quot;H.D. by Delia Alton&quot; 189). She felt that         such revision would obscure the associative and metonymic logic of fantasy.         H.D. refuses to re-shape the text in the interests of tidiness or coherence         because she understands how this editorial impulse accounts for the loss         of documents that do not meet cultural prescriptions for the sacred, accurate,         literary, or even literate. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Susan         Howe: Witnessing the Native</i></font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Fright             is formed by what we see not by what they say.</font></p>          <blockquote>             <blockquote>              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;--                 Susan Howe, <i>Frame Structures</i> (16)</font></p>            </blockquote>          </blockquote>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Susan         Howes book-length serial poem, <i>Articulation of Sound Forms in Time,</i>         likewise centers on an unstable (or &quot;ecstatic&quot;) eye-witness         to a traumatic historical event -- the Reverend Hope Atherton and his         traumatic experiences during the Connecticut River Valley &quot;Falls         Fight&quot; of May 1676. The deranged minister &quot;Hope&quot; is a split,         dissociated, and fractured subject who has survived extreme conditions         and is able to give report of them. In the first stanzas of the poem,         we hear the cracked speech of a person who is &quot;beside himself,&quot;         a sensibility opened up to the multiplicities of language. Hopes trauma         and wilderness-wandering are enunciated in a strange, babbling rhythm         that comprises a kind of speaking in tongues: &quot;quench conch uncannunc,&quot;         we read, &quot;drumm amonoosuck ythian&quot; (10).

The seven         densely packed stanzas that open the first section, &quot;Hope Athertons         Wanderings,&quot; appear as a kind of archeological dig -- &quot;deep         so deep as my narrative&quot; (S 9) -- that turns up nothing but the rubble         of often obsolete language: &quot;Clog nutmeg abt noon / scraping cano         muzzell / foot path sand and so / gravel rubbish vandal horse flesh ryal         tabl . . .&quot; (S 6). The markers of official historical chronicle appear         in these poems -- places, names, dates, times, numbers -- &quot;April,&quot;         &quot;Clay Gully,&quot; &quot;May,&quot; and &quot;abt noon&quot; -- but         only as shards and fragments, not the product of a single shaping consciousness.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The result         is what might appear to be the demolition of the lyric &quot;I&quot; and         thus of any potential for testimonial address. If the lyric &quot;I&quot;         has been understood as a framing structure that makes witnessing possible         in poetry, Howes poems investigate those traumatic events that refuse         to stay within its frame of reference, resisting our efforts at translation,         explanation, and rationalization. &quot;A piece of sentence left unfinished,&quot;         says Howe, &quot;can act as witness to the question proposed by a suspended         ending&quot; (&quot;Ether&quot; 126). For Howe, the extreme iconoclasm,         fragmentation, and seriality of ecstatic or mystic speech paradoxically         allows the poet to access and register historys previously invisible         persons and inarticulate voices. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;As a         method for recovering the lost voices of others, this kind of violent         iconoclasm is somewhat questionable. Having absorbed so much violence         and having, in turn, projected so much aggression, Howes writing pushes         H.D.s dislocating ecstatic historiography to its logical extreme, testing         its practical consequences for the reading audience. Her poetry forces         the question of how far poetic language can move in the direction of materializing         the traumas and dislocations of history before it relinquishes the possibility         of poetic agency and surrenders the human capacity to bear historical         witness. Howe herself adds a note of caution, saying in an interview,         &quot;I am concerned that so much of my work carries violence in it&quot;         (B 177).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         peculiar violence of Howes poetic method cannot be denied, and her poetry         asks us to consider the relation of violence to the work of witnessing.         To what degree does a witness transmit or re-enact the violence to which         she testifies? To what extent is the witness, then, implicated in that         violence? If Howe views her archival source texts as &quot;crime scenes,&quot;         can her own texts be invulnerable to the same charge? Can the iconoclastic         poet -- especially one who writes as survivor and thus as historys &quot;winner&quot;         -- be excused from complicity or collusion with the original violating         event? Furthermore, how can such pulverized and violated language be reconciled         with Howes tender and even sentimental desires to &quot;lift&quot; and         rescue lost voices? This dilemma is inherent to the work of witness: while         witness requires a coherent narrative or storytelling voice, relying for         much of its force on the listener/readers clear sense of an authorial         presence and identity, it must also resist and disrupt the totalizing         finality of the master narratives that legitimate one groups domination         and enforce cultural (and textual) conformity.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;For         Howe, important stories are waiting to be told, and urgent voices are         waiting to be articulated: &quot;Poetry brings similitude and representation         to configurations waiting from forever to be spoken&quot; (&quot;Ether&quot;         14). History is an empirically provable reality, not an elusive fiction.         She longs, in fact, to recover an innocent and undefiled source-text,         although she knows that this desire can only be disappointed. For Howe,         history ultimately comes down to a question of sources, and she is torn         between two distinctly textual approaches to historical writing. On the         one hand is her visionary faith in the historian as archivist who unearths         or &quot;hears&quot; new voices, documents, and materials. On the other         is her less optimistic understanding of language itself as evidence and         &quot;source&quot; from whose indifferent chaos and debris we must somehow         construct a new narrative. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In attempting         to re-read dominant discourse for traces of the victimized, repressed,         and silenced of history who precede that discourse, Howes work diverges         from poststructuralist approaches to bear strong affinities with the project         of New Historicism. But this historical project of resurrecting or sheltering         inarticulate voices, however important and necessary, has its dangers         and limits. One of these dangers, warns Rey Chow in &quot;Where Have All         the Natives Gone?,&quot; is that the historian-as-witness will actually         preempt the space of supposedly &quot;inarticulate&quot; voices, stepping         &quot;far too quickly, into the otherwise silent and invisible place of         the native and turn ourselves into living agents/witnesses for her&quot;         (133). For Chow, the critics &quot;self-appointed gesture of witnessing&quot;         often ends up perpetuating the silence of the object of investigation         (135). Her main concern is that, in the process of thus bearing witness,         historians can unwittingly &quot;neutralize the untranslatability of the         natives experience and the history of that untranslatability&quot; (133).         The New Historical method involves reconstructing &quot;lost&quot; experience,         often by &quot;collecting&quot; fragments of a lost culture and recontextualizing         them. We can read Howes poems, for example, as &quot;exhibiting&quot;         the shards of the lost or demolished vocabularies of antinomian communities         and native cultures. For Chow, this kind of historical re-collection of         these unintelligible fragments can become complicit with the hegemonic         discourse it supposedly critiques by virtue of its need &quot;to convert,         recode, make transparent, and thus represent even those experiences that         resist it with a stubborn opacity&quot; (133). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;But         it is precisely the opacity and untranslatability of this experience of         the &quot;Other&quot; that Howe aims to preserve and embody in her writing.         One of her most powerful methods for preserving this &quot;untranslatability&quot;         is to investigate instances of ecstatic or &quot;mystic&quot; speech without         recoding this speech into closed or easily digestible narratives or otherwise         making it transparent to the reader. If the &quot;active evidence&quot;         or &quot;original witness&quot; of the traumatic, victimizing experience,         as Chow puts it, &quot;no longer exists in any intelligible, coherent         shape&quot; (134), Howes poetry seeks to restore agency to that traumatized         subjectivity by allowing its language, in Chows phrase, to &quot;bear         witness to its own demolition&quot; (144). As Paul Celan puts it, &quot;No         one bears witness for the witness&quot; (qtd in Felman 3). To the extent         that the lyric &quot;I&quot; cannot stand in as a witness for another,         Howe seeks a poetic method that will allow language the agency to bear         witness for itself, in ways that can preserve rather than erase what will         not yield to understanding. Howe is preoccupied less with the witnessing         of actual events occurring in the past than with the method by which historical         repression and recovery operate and by which a &quot;recollection&quot;         of those events is undertaken. As Lynn Keller suggests, Howes poems focus         on &quot;the dynamics of the silencing they encounter&quot; rather than         on bringing to life the imagined individual subjectivity of a silenced         historical figure (190-91). By methodically researching varieties of ecstatic         speech and knowledge (e.g., her essays on colonial American women's conversion         testimonies and captivity narratives), Howe makes partially intelligible         the others experience, while preserving in her disjunctive writing style         the shock of its unintelligibility and untranslatability. The special         receptivity of poet and reader to this ecstatic speech, which often arises         out of traumatic experience, becomes oddly inextricable from an ethical         poetic method for historical recovery.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;To return         to some questions I laid out earlier: Can a poetry whose language and         subject are fragmented into disarticulation and &quot;barbarous jargon&quot;         offer forms of human agency and a basis for resistance? In Howes case         this redirected agency takes the form of what she calls &quot;Telepsychology.         We have always been in contact with one another, keeping on never letting         go, no distance as to time, nothing such as liberty because we are in         the field of history&quot; (FS 25). Does the lack of liberty necessarily         mean the renunciation of agency? What can we make of Howe when she says         of her &quot;historical consciousness&quot; that &quot;I have no choice         in it&quot; (FS 13)? For H.D. and Howe, history is a field of operation         that the poet may not choose to occupy but must nonetheless inhabit. Their         ecstatic witnesses do not choose to narrate -- they are &quot;chosen.&quot;         Yet this lack of &quot;choice&quot; does not entirely negate the poets         agency in manipulating language within this given field. The question         is how to occupy this field (of history and the page) without becoming         the colonizer of other peoples voices, while making space for an active,         rearticulating process that is creative rather than destructive and remains         open and receptive. Howe writes in <i>The Birth-Mark</i> that the purpose         of &quot;canonical social power&quot; is &quot;to render isolate voices         devoted to writing as a physical event of immediate revelation&quot; (1).         Social forces do violence to texts in attempting to remove or destroy         their birth-marks: the unintelligible scroll is burned, the discredited         letter is lost, the messy memoir is judiciously abridged. In response         to these canonizing pressures, H.D. and Howe create text-based &quot;authors&quot;         who are composites of writer, reader, and editor, all present at the primal         archaeological scene of the lyric narratives genesis. In so doing, they         un-settle the wilderness of language, creating a wildly &quot;unstable         I-witness&quot; (Howes term) -- an intersubjective, witnessing agency         whose imperative is the return and repossession of what Susan Howe calls         &quot;the birth-mark&quot; and H.D. names &quot;the gift.&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Works         Cited</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Caruth,         Cathy. <i>Unclaimed Experience: Trauma, Narrative, and History.</i> Baltimore:         Johns</font> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hopkins         UP, 1996.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Chow, Rey.         &quot;Where Have All the Natives Gone?&quot; <i>Displacements: Cultural         Identities in</i></font> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Question.</i>         Ed.
