There was certainly little         usable past of feminist innovation available to women writers of the modern         period; Mina Loy, H.D., and others positioned their work in ambivalent         relation to masculine avant-garde agendas. By contrast, rather than responding         to male avant-gardists, contemporary women experimentalists claim their         place in a continuing feminist history, establishing what Fraser has called         a &quot;tradition of marginality.&quot; Among such women, Susan Howe has         molded a version of that alternative history that draws not just from         modernist precursors but from sources that predate experimentation from         the modern period. In this sense Howe both attests to the importance of         modernist women and underlines a still lengthier lineage--one often unacknowledged         as a source for contemporary feminist avant-gardism.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Howe         contends that the &quot;American practice&quot; of a poetics that &quot;involves         a fracturing of discourse, a breaking of boundaries of all sorts&quot;         has been largely excluded from the canon, and even &quot;when the history         of this sub sub group gets written even <i>here</i> women get shut up         or out&quot; (Bernstein 192-3). Howe notes:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When             I read books about American poetry and even current discussions among             poets. . . I generally read about men. Yes, Dickinson is in the canon.             But she is treated as an isolated case, not as part of an on-going             influence. . . . Stein is brought in but again as an isolated case,             with influence, but somehow a break in the line. Marianne Moore the             same, an isolated phenomenon. . . .[And] with H.D. we must always             hear of her romantic connection to Pound, Lawrence, even the Williams             friendship is presented not in terms of poetry but romance or rejection.             And its usually their influence on her, not her influence on them.             <i>(Tal</i> 26)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In such         texts as<i> My Emily Dickinson</i> and others (some excerpted in <i>HOW(ever))</i>,         Howe illustrates that work such as hers is far from an &quot;isolated         case.&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Howe         clearly establishes the importance to her own work of modernist women         poets, particularly H.D. One section from<i> Trilogy</i> supplies Howe         with an epigraph for<i> Singularities</i> (1990): H.D.s lines refer to         the figure of the Lady, a sign of spiritual renewal in &quot;Tribute to         the Angels&quot;: &quot;she must have been pleased with us, / for she         looked so kindly at us&quot; (<i>CP</i> 568). Howe cites as a fragment         the lines that follow--"under her drift of veils, / and she carried a         book." These phrases link feminine identity to language; they couple the         book, symbol of knowledge, with veils that obscure the Lady's body, and         with it, her identity. This epigraph to Howe's collection signals her         debt to H.D. and one of their shared fascinations: the linking of woman         and word, at the same time that sexual definition is blurred, making space         for the re-vision of identity itself. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Yet         Howe just as often pays tribute to a feminist dissidence that<i> informs</i>         modernism:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the             college library I use there are two writers whose work refuses to             conform to the Anglo-American literary traditions these institutions             perpetuate. Emily Dickinson and Gertrude Stein are clearly among the             most innovative precursors of modernist poetry and prose, yet to this             day canonical criticism from Harold Bloom to Hugh Kenner persists             in dropping their names and ignoring their work. Why these two pathfinders             were women, why American--are questions too often lost in the penchant             for biographical detail that &quot;lovingly&quot; muffles their voices.             <i>(MED</i> 11)</font></p>          <p align="CENTER"></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Reminiscent         of Woolfs Oxford halls in<i> A</i><i> Room of Ones Own</i>, Howes &quot;college         library&quot; and the sanctioned books within it point to a patriarchal         control that silences innovative women. Howes witness of this lost avant-garde         tradition connects Dickinson to Stein, and both to her own texts. Howe         analyzes one of Dickinsons manuscript pages: &quot;These lines traced         by pencil or in ink on paper were formed by an innovator. . . . There         are political implications here,&quot; for Dickinsons texts necessitate         &quot;an end to passive consumerism&quot;<i> (HOW(ever)</i> 3.4 [1986]:         12). As the poets progeny, Howe demonstrates how revolutionary were Dickinson's         idiosyncrasies: &quot;Codes are confounded and converted. Authoritative         readings confuse her nonconformity&quot; (<i>BM</i> 139); &quot;If we         could perfectly restore each packet to its original order, her original         impulse would be impossible to decipher. The manuscript books and sets         preserve their insubordination&quot; <i>(BM</i> 144).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Howe         also traces an antinomian lineage that underlies Dickinsons transgression:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The             issue of editorial control is directly connected to the attempted             erasure of antinomianism in our culture. . . . The excommunication             and banishment of the early American female preacher and prophet Anne             Hutchinson, and the comparison of her opinions to monstrous births,             is not unrelated to the editorial apprehension and domestication of             Emily Dickinson. . . . The antinomian controversy continues in the             form, often called formlessness, of Dickinsons letters and poems.<i>             (BM</i> 1)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dickinsons         innovations sparked a reception akin to that of Anne Hutchinsons antinomian         rebellion; Howe identifies &quot;Dickinsons refusal during her teens         to join the Congregational Church during the Great Awakening&quot; as         emblematic of a feminist genealogy: the poets defiance of &quot;great         community pressure recalls the stubborn strength in isolation of Mary         Rowlandson. Her intuitive spiritual apprehension links her with Anne Hutchinson         and Mary Dyer&quot;<i> (MED</i> 54). Thus Dickinsons &quot;apprehension&quot;         hearkens back to a female heterodoxy that exhibits both &quot;strength         in isolation&quot; and a literary daring stemming from Hutchinsons un-feminine         speech.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Howe         locates in these womens dissidence a model for her efforts to show how         gender operates as a limitation in language. Following her court and church         trials, &quot;Mrs. Hutchinson was silenced&quot;<i> (BM</i> 58), banished         from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638, for having criticized the colonys         patriarchs for preaching what she held was a covenant of works rather         than the New England Puritans covenant of grace. Howe notes that Hutchinsons         story served as a terrifying object lesson to generations of women who         risked &quot;unwiving&quot; themselves by acquiring learning or--worse         still--daring to preach the word. One example Howe points to was the wife         of the governor of Hartford, who, as John Winthrop described it in his         journal, &quot;was fallen into a sad infirmity, the loss of her understanding         and reason. . . by occasion of her giving herself wholly to reading and         writing.&quot; <a href="#1"><b><kbd>(1)</kbd></b></a> <a name="fn1"></a>As         Amy Schrager Lang explains, the accusations of antinomianism leveled against         Anne Hutchinson stemmed from gendered roles: &quot;the gender-specific         problem of the public woman figures the larger dilemma of maintaining         the law&quot; (3); &quot;the crime attributed to Hutchinson at her trial         is the violation of her role. She is condemned for playing the part of         teacher, minister, magistrate, husband.&quot; Hence the cautionary tales         penned by Thomas Welde, Cotton Mather, and other chroniclers and preachers         -- representations of Anne Hutchinson as Eve (&quot;both seduced and seductress&quot;),         Jezebel (sexual wanton), and even Hydra (&quot;the archetypal mother of         monsters&quot;) (Lang 65). That Hutchinsons &quot;sin&quot; was fundamentally         gendered in Puritan imaginations is apparent in the comparison between         the Hutchinsonians misguided notions and &quot;monstrous births,&quot;         which came &quot;out of their wombs, as . . . out of their braines,&quot;         as Welde explained. <a href="#2"><kbd><b>(2)</b></kbd></a> <a name="fn2"></a>The         still-born &quot;issue&quot; of Hutchinsons follower Mary Dyer was the         literal progeny of Hutchinsons doctrines. According to Winthrops journal,         Mary Dyers infant was born with a headless body adorned by horns and         scales, the visible sign of Gods vengeance against Hutchinson and her         defenders, and a vindication of the Church fathers who would see them         duly punished. Howe identifies the antinomian controversy as the founding         moment in the feminist past she claims. Mary Dyers &quot;monstrous birth&quot;         becomes a figure for Howes own de-forming, experimental texts -- a dissonance         of words &quot;born&quot; from the discordant voice of the heretical Anne         Hutchinson and from the outlawed feminine knowledge of the midwife (&quot;witch&quot;)         who birthed the still-born child. Howes texts become that child: &quot;One         has just been born. A monist conception. It is a daughter a monster the         other<i>&quot; (BM</i> 119).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Howe         describes this tradition as deliberately transgressing literary mores         -- a feminist &quot;avant-gardism&quot; <i>avant la lettre</i>. Howe calls         Rowlandsons 1682<i> A True History of the Captivity and Restoration of         Mrs. Mary Rowlandson,</i> her account of Indian capture and eventual release,         &quot;the first published narrative written by an Anglo-American woman         ostensibly to serve as a reminder of Gods Providence.&quot; Yet, it is         manifestly un-feminine, opening with gunfire, the murder of children,         a burning home, and the cutting open of a slain settlers bowels. Writing         against the grain of femininity, daringly confronting the violence inherent         in her story, &quot;Mary Rowlandson saw what she did not see said what         she did not say&quot;<i> (BM</i>&nbsp;128). Such literary transgression         sets Rowlandson apart from her celebrated counterpart--the &quot;tenth         muse,&quot; Anne Bradstreet. With undisguised irony, Howe calls Rowlandsons         textual violence a &quot;far cry from Anne Bradstreets polished pious         verse&quot;<i> (BM</i> 95); she distances herself not just from the piety         but also from the <i>poetics</i> of the circumspect Bradstreet, whose         &quot;correct&quot; verse, like her piety, manifestly served to keep her         safe. Howe notes that &quot;Anne Bradstreet gained public acceptance as         a writer&quot; in the shadow of Anne Hutchinson and the hapless Mary Dyer:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The             excommunication and banishment of Anne Hutchinson; the banishment             of Mary Dyer; published reports of their &quot;monster&quot; premature             babies; the reprimands or silencing of other women who were midwives,             had medical knowledge, or transgressed the male boundaries of theology             by preaching. . . were ominous precedents. Anne Bradstreet was the             daughter of a governor of Massachusetts and the wife of a leading             magistrate, both of whom were virulent persecutors of Anne Hutchinson.<i>             (BM</i> 113)</font></p>          <p align="CENTER"></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The object         lesson was powerful; in Howes account, Bradstreet adopts polish and piety         in a bid for survival, while Bradstreets sister &quot;was less fortunate&quot;:         in a reprise of Anne Hutchinsons offenses, Sarah Dudley Keayne trespassed         onto the male domain of theology, having &quot;growne a great preacher&quot;;         her husband Thomas Dudley wrote to his father-in-law, &quot;shee has unwived         her selfe.&quot; As a result, she was disinherited, lost her husband and         custody of her daughter (thus figuring the demise of female lineage),         and was finally relegated to historical oblivion. <a href="#3"><kbd><b>(3)</b></kbd></a>         <a name="fn3"></a></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Howe         contrasts the circumspect tradition of Anne Bradstreet with that of feminist         innovators, whose daring renders unthinkable the degree of public acceptability         Bradstreets &quot;polished verse&quot; permitted. It is appropriate,         then, that Bradstreets poems were reclaimed by an American woman writer         who advances what Fraser calls the &quot;common language&quot; aesthetic         of second-wave feminism: in 1967 Adrienne Rich wrote the foreword to Bradstreets         newly-available selected poems. By contrast, Howe locates her lineage         in the terrain of a feminist Puritan dissent wherein &quot;The violence         of ambiguity&quot; is voiced, and &quot;Disorder is another order&quot;<i>         (BM</i> 122). In the dichotomy between the verse-piety of Bradstreet and         the heterodox &quot;enthusiasm&quot; of Hutchinson, Howe unequivocally         chooses the latter--what she calls in<i> Articulation of Sound Forms in         Time </i>&quot;Enunciate barbarous jargon / fluent language of fanaticism&quot;<i>         (S</i> 31). Howe points to this antinomian enthusiasm as the start of         a tradition of feminist avant-garde resistance.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Invoking         these precursors, Howe, like Fraser, inscribes a feminist tradition for         which she seeks broader recognition. Yet Howes effort to construct a         <i>pre</i>-modernist legacy also suggests the hunger for a literary history         that might place dissident women -- and not just those of the modern period         -- in the center of the &quot;story&quot; of American letters. Howe implies         that the search for a usable past, particularly that of feminist avant-gardists,         requires redefinitions of such fundamental terms as &quot;feminism,&quot;         &quot;avant-gardism,&quot; and &quot;modernism&quot; to make room for         greater understanding of submerged traditions of resistance, both textual         and political. Howes work also reveals the extent to which poetics can         become the site of such textual recovery: like<i> HOW(ever),</i> Howes         researches erase distinctions between the critical and the poetic--a gesture,         Howe might argue, presaged not just in the work of H.D., Stein, and other         modernists, but in the voices of Dickinson, Rowlandson, and the Puritan         Anne Hutchinson.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left"></p>      <p align="left"><b><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Works         Cited</font></b></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bernstein,         Charles, ed. <i>The Politics of Poetic Form</i>.
