Or, if interrupted in her writing elsewhere, she continued         to revise and make notes while carrying out a kitchen-side task. [See         Figure 1, writing on a chocolate bar wrapper] </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="../../photos/fig1-aifemurray-sendmesomething.gif" width="360" height="279" alt="Figure 1"></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Jeanne Holland         situates these particular "household technologies" &#150; the use of scraps         and ephemera in her "pantry writing" &#150; as increased and particularly         evident from the late 1860s onward (Holland 1994, 150, 155). <a href="#2">(<kbd>2</kbd>)</a>         As this coincides with maid-of-all-work Margaret Maher's arrival and tenure         (1869-1899), it suggests that because of her maid's dependable efforts,         Dickinson was able to keep her literary work more present, as she went         between desk and pantry, writing and skimming milk. <a href="#3">(3)</a>         And it also suggests that the cross-class collaborations in the Homestead         kitchen were played out in the eclectic fusion of materials.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dickinson         also created hybrids by mixing her writing with postage stamps, flowers,         pine needles, and with text and illustrations cut from her books and popular         magazines. [See Figure 2, response to a postage stamp, and Figure 3, a         mixed media poem.] </font></p>      <img src="../../photos/fig2-aifemurray-sendmesomething.gif" width="432" height="317" alt="Figure 2">       <p><img src="../../photos/fig3-aifemurray-sendmesomething.gif" width="432" height="352" alt="Figure 3"></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Martha Nell         Smith has focused on the cartooning evident in some of Dickinson's correspondence         and poetry. <a href="#4">(4)</a> [See Figure 4] Holland believes that         mixing forms may have been a strategy Dickinson used for keeping her verse         alive. By creating these hybrid forms, and by practicing the folk economies         of the town &#150; exchanges of food and labor &#150; Dickinson gave equal         value to daily life and creative production (Holland 1994, 152). The means         and authority achieved in the domestic realm were carried into Dickinson's         literary work. </font></p>      <p><img src="../../photos/fig4-aifemurray-sendmesomething.gif" width="432" height="311" border="0"></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The power         of hybrids lies in their refusal to be pinned down. Hybrids resist "domestication,"         or even labeling, which acts as a constraint. The mix of forms function         as an opening in the text and its meaning. In Dickinson's work the site         of the domestic-familiar is de-familiarized through her hybrid contractions.         This allows the writer (and reader) to move to the terrain of the unfamiliar,         the unmanageable, where the deep discoveries in writing are made (Gibbons         1989, 105). Operating at these borders, where her media and peopled-world         meet, allows Dickinson to practice a "freedom of direction" to challenge         hierarchies, and rename experience in her own image (Quartermain 1992,         173). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dickinson's         hybrids also act as a form of <i> signifying</i> &#150; as in the African-American         trope &#150; where there's a gap between what the words (and materials)         say and what they mean. This creates a tension in motion that conveys         the poem as still actively ongoing (Fishkin 1993, 60)<b>. </b>Poet and         scholar Juliana Spahr argues that hybrids leave loopholes in the text         that undermine authority. She says "[a] border is the authority of place.         But as one crosses it, and someone always is, it is a place of the liminal         defined by the back and forth." (Spahr 1994, 289-290). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Writing         on chocolate bar wrappers or placing stamps within her poems captures         two opposable gestures. Mixing what is permanent (literature) <i>with         </i>ephemera (housework, conversation, daily life), allows Dickinson to         highlight their juncture <i>and</i> rupture (Phillips 1995, 173). Her         hybrid forms encompass chance or fleeting moments. Inherent in her literary         work is both the seamlessness between domesticity and writing, between         her life and that of her servants <i>and </i>the abutment, the defining         border. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dickinson's         mix of high and low art forms &#150; the literary with kitchen ephemera         &#150; tracks the shifting realities in 19th-century America, specifically         agrarian Amherst, where the old forms of communal self-reliance and mixing         of classes were giving way to the "vagaries of the market" and hardening         class lines (Holland 1994, 154). Mixed forms or hybrids denote the junctures         and ruptures apparent in Dickinson's own (cross-class, cross-cultural)         kitchen, not unlike the way mixed compositions in today's writing and         art scene "score" similar effects in the late 20th-century. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Commenting         on the usage of hybrids in the contemporary American poetry scene, poet         Leslie Scalapino, has observed that "those without social power are less         inclined to see reality as orderly; for example, less inclined to see         the social construction as unified" (Osman and Spahr 1996, 4). <a href="#5">(5)</a>         The hybrids become a "mediative instrument" that recognizes <i>silence</i>         in the ephemera and <i>voice</i> in the literary (Creighton 1996, 38).         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 19th-century         New England, Dickinson's work encodes the border as juncture, the fringe,         the simultaneously viewed past and present (G&oacute;mez-Pe&ntilde;a,         44). In a nation without a way of talking about hybrids &#150; holding         a "horror of, as well as fascination for, the cultural hybrid, for <i>mestizaje</i>"         &#150; Dickinson's diverse manuscripts construct and describe an American         multiplicity (Creighton 1996, 86).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We can,         if we choose, read these mixed forms as a way that Dickinson complicates         the notions of literature and domesticity to revise "the borders marking         what constitutes 'American' cultural inheritance." That is, in the acknowledgment         of the <i>socialtext</i> [i.e. the social environment of her text-making]         and her domestic form, the hybrids begin to "contest, complicate and/or         redefine the contours of the myth regarding one-way ethnic assimilation         into a perceived standard of Anglo-American national identity" and literature         (Creighton 1996, 226, 216). <a href="#6">(6)</a></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By situating         her hybrids in the traditional female kitchen site, she returns language         making to its place of origin, to the mothered tongue. And it establishes,         perhaps especially for women, a literary legacy forged from the language         spoken around the kitchen table with the written one of (elite and predominantly         white male) literature. Not only does this ideological split &#150; male         literary tradition and female domesticity &#150; collapse in Dickinson's         hybrid work (Holland 1994,<b> </b>152), but it creates a lineage for Dickinson         and a way to "notate the moving path of [her] discovering intelligence"         (Fraser 1988, 152). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As she crossed         back and forth between genres &#150; outside of traditional form and into         the sphere of another class and culture &#150; she forged a literature         that visualizes the "the split subject," the double, or multiple consciousness         of American experience. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&copy; copyright         3/97 </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Footnotes</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><a name="1"></a>1.         "send me something drawen on paper" is excerpted from a paper delivered         in April 1997 at the Northeast Modern Language Association, Philadelphia         PA, and at Hampshire College, Amherst MA.
