As if modeling its own reception, a Guest poem         doesnt come (defensively) trailing explanations of itself, it just comes,         and becomes. Herein perhaps lies the reason that she has been so much         praised and so little discussed, analyzed, interpreted; there is a sufficiency         to her poems, which fills, fulfils and abashes, and which humbles even         word-mongering professions: literary historians and critics, theoreticians,         academics. Her poems &quot;need not be deciphered or uncoded but simply         let be.&quot; There is a kind of tribute in this critical silence; the         poets of course (Hillman, Fraser, Welish, Going, Rabinowitz, DuPlessis,         Bernstein) have found their own ways to be Guests readers in print. There         is much to be learned from their intelligent straddling of the fatiguing,         futile poetry/criticism divide.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And         yet, its hard to &quot;simply let be,&quot; as Bernstein advises, the         ravishing poems of this book. The poems themselves dont dictate silence;         quite the opposite: &quot;strike that simpleton / Bafflement&quot; the         poem commands, &quot;<i>Thee&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&#9;GLOSS GLOSS // point to         the Mix . . . &quot; (That italicized &quot;<i>thee</i>&quot; is as clear         an intimate aside as ever &quot;Dear Reader&quot; was, urging the reader         not to be baffled by the poems, not to evade them as too disjunctive,         too difficult, too perfect). One doesnt want to &quot;uncode,&quot; loving         the code too much to want to be the agent of its undoing. (Except for         the kind of decoding described by Rachel DuPlessis as &quot;the mysterious         random process of associative and accretive decoding.&quot;) Nor does         &quot;deciphering&quot; appeal, which also implies unlanguaging. To decipher         is to &quot;convert into ordinary writing&quot;  Guests readers must         expect extraordinary writing, and feel reluctant to convert mysteries         and eccentricities into orthodoxies.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In         that phrase &quot;let it be,&quot; lurks both the sense of &quot;let it         alone&quot; and &quot;let it be what it is.&quot; The poems have their         reader so much in their sights; they do not let her alone, but subject         her to a wise scrutiny and an irresistible call, therefore one cannot         leave them alone but must answer back in some way. As for the second sense         -- &quot;let it be what it is&quot; -- what power does anyone have to         do otherwise? But the command &quot;point to the Mix,&quot; encourages         the reader to attention to <i>what it is and how it does</i>. Note well:         this is not un- or de-mixing; but appreciative description of the way         the words consort, their mixing-it-up on the page, their intercourse,         their dance, their oxymoronic tussle, their &quot;silvered montage,&quot;         their sighs and hiccups and jokes and caresses. Is this what Bernstein         means when he advises writers as they write poetry and readers as they         read &quot;to attend to the internal event that is taking place in it&quot;?         Guest forthrightly directs her reader, in capital letters, to &quot;GLOSS         GLOSS,&quot; to add words to her words. The book, much more strikingly         than Guests other work, is full of such reader-directed metapoetics,         full of advice for her readers and curiosity about them.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rocks         on a Platter</i> is partly about how writing poetry requires allowing         and rewarding ones own ingenuity and peculiarity: that is, it can only         be accomplished, in her words, &quot;without shyness or formality.&quot;         When Guest performs the poets receptive audacity, I understand this to         be a stance one might take <i>toward </i>poetry, modeled here as the necessary         stance <i>of </i>poetry. Here is an example of her intimate lure and dare.         It is all of page 47:</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And         ingenuity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&#9;follows         the silvered<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;montage         into a new elevation</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As         if whispered</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And         so, where Guest is concerned, one is pulled, (passionately) uncertain,         but unrepentant, in this odd direction, toward a &quot;criticism of desire.&quot;         This phrase comes from Bernsteins &quot;Artifice of Absorption,&quot;         quoted as ballast:</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why         not<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A         criticism intoxicated with its own metaphoricity<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">or         tropicality: one in which the limits of<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">positive         criticism are made more audibly<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">artificial;         in which the inadequacy of our<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">explanatory         paradigms is neither ignored<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">nor         regretted but brought into fruitful play.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Imagine,         then, oscillating poles,<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">constructing         not some better dyadicism, but<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">congealing         into a field of potentialities<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">that         in turn collapses (transforms) into yet other<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">tropicalities.         This would be the criticism of desire:<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">sowing         not reaping. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Some         orienting notes:</b> the book is divided into four untitled sections,         each of which is headed by a quotation from the aesthetic theories of,         respectively: H&ouml;lderlin, Samuel Johnson, Hegel, and Adorno. Each         of these sections could and should be read as a long, multi-part poem         in colloquy with its introductory quotation. Yet, each page, by itself,         is also a unit shapely in its appointment, making a singular claim on         the readers attention and consideration. The poems look spare, and are         irradiated by the whiteness of the page, in the style of much of Guests         recent poetry. Yet they are beguilingly multivalent: polyreferent, suggestively         allusive, polytonal (I sometimes think that in tone lies Guests deepest         meaning). Some suggest dilemma and struggle, others a knowing fusion of         opposites. The poems try the notion of &quot;form,&quot; which often means         that their subject is themselves, and yet this tautological premise limits         Guest not at all, so thoroughly does she enjoy (also mourn?) the elusiveness         and mobility of form, its openness (susceptibility) to change, ambivalence         and the imagination, its permutations and persistence. It is not for nothing         that she quotes Adornos insight that &quot;The Moment a limit is posited         it is overstepped, and that against which the limit was established is         absorbed.&quot; </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">[Those lovely         and generous white spaces elicit contradictory responses at least as insistently         as does the typographical poem proper. Should I (I do) 1. admire them         and preserve the space they create in and around the poem, that silence         out of which the poems speaks, the sense that these are rare objects separated         from the rest of the noisy hullabaloo of the information age? Should I         preserve the possibility of my coming upon them newly and freshly? or         should I (I do) 2. Fill them up as hungry interstices, pauses for my input,         invitations to dialogue?

These questions         and regrets (&quot;Alas&quot;) suggest Guests own poetics, the aesthetic         theory that she ascribes to, and that she has and will write by, in spite         of many false ideas and much hullabaloo about the whole question. But         of course hers is a broken and evasive argument: which is to say: the         best, the most convincing argument -- one that doesnt lie by means of         high-flown or argumentative rhetoric, but just puts a pear-shaped readable         thing there, near the grasp of the hand.

How do we &quot;touch&quot; poetry? How do we touch         by means of poetry? Is this a kind of Tactilism (!) comparable to Imagism?         Does it have to do with the textures of words, our ability to respond         to them by means of our &quot;inner skin&quot; as well as our &quot;inner         eye&quot;?

If ideas         find themselves in trees, they must surely be tested by how well they         can graft.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And         then, Barbara Guest is a great poet of &quot;space composition&quot;the         location of things, including ideas, in time and space. (Isnt Guests         famous allusiveness a way of locating, dislocating, and relocating ideas         in time and space?) Are ideas like H&ouml;lderlins (&quot;To live is         to defend a form . . .&quot;) timeless and spaceless or do they have to         find a tree and a century they are prepared to inhabit, either with grace         or as a vital irritant? How does an &quot;idea&quot; from aesthetic theory         consort with a poem? These poems wink at and flirt with aesthetic theory,         teasing its pomposity; sometimes they court it and qualify it and surround         it with things: wind, rocks, typography, old shoe, bricks, the &quot;animal-clad         wood,&quot; trout, Mont Blanc, cats-cradle,&nbsp; <i>fleur dor</i>, porcelain,         a feather, the Dolphin, a &quot;sweet pumpkin,&quot; the &quot;apparition         shape of thy head.&quot; Why do we think philosophy and theory will &quot;explain&quot;         art? Why is art more palatable once philosophy deigns to notice it and         runs it through a systematic? Why is a poet expected to articulate her         poetics in prose? When and why does a poet come to want to articulate         her poetics in prose? How can a reader help herself from becoming a writing         reader? &quot;The obvious problem,&quot; writes Bernstein, &quot;is that         the poem said in any other way is not the poem.&quot; Yeah. Alas. So be         it.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>So to         return to page 17</b>: What is the ideal, supposed answer to the question:         &quot;Is the pear-shaped manuscript / endangered?&quot; Perhaps: <i>of         course</i>, the pear-shaped manuscript is grievously endangered: first         because all manuscripts are endangered (by computers, mainly, but also         by TV and telephone, and by our too fast modern pace).

An artist must at times deserve to feel lighthearted in         their presence. After the loud and large &quot;TREMENDOUS TUNE-UP,&quot;         there is the echo of (lower case) &quot;tremendous &#9;tune-up,&quot;         which is more thoughtful and in its slowness, less flippant, but still:         &quot;tra-la-la.&quot; Who would have thought that tra-la-la would deserve         an entry in the OED, but it does, as viable (as traditional) a word as         &quot;tradition,&quot; or &quot;orthodoxy.&quot; Arent there Shakespeare         lyrics that end with nonsense words as a kind of refrain (&quot;a hey,         and a ho, and a hey nonny-no&quot;), also Yeats (&quot;Fol de rol, fol         de rol&quot;). Here it is not just initial-letter alliteration that delights,         but a kind of running permutation on first syllables: Tra, tan, the, tre,         ten, tru, tre, tri, tre, tun, tre, tun, tra, and ort, ORT! The freedom         that &quot;nonsensical&quot; words confer; they take you most swiftly         out of the constricting rules and assumptions and attitudes of the prevailing         discourse, like someone laughing or making a rude noise in church or at         an academic conference. Guest doesnt abjure any level of diction, any         world of words, and she finds comedy and freedom in the mix. Tradition         and Theory do sometimes carry their vocabulary heavily and stiflingly;         they need the oxygen in &quot;tra-la-la,&quot; with its open-mouthed sound,         its flourish, its swift trump and TRIUMPH, and its own (very respectable)         linguistic and literary longevity.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Along this         enchanting line of inquiry, theres the hiccup: &quot;an odd note, the         hiccup.&quot; Page 32 delivers a Steinian dream-poem, prose-poem, love         poem: </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Here             the dream began, two voices, one joking, this took place in sleep,             you remember, and the other caressing, a tussle between the joking             and the caress, points of view caressingly and jokingly; they often             sighed between joking and caressing, the hiccup, an odd note the hiccup,             between the joking and caressing; perhaps a lapse in the dream. </font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is         a lively language tussle, in which one voice jokes and one caresses.

One is visited by (or becomes?) a creature         that gives off light perpendicularly from the shoulders (or suffers lights         to be attached perpendicularly to the shoulders?). Since a shoulder is         curved; these lights must give off a dazzling arc. To touch the wrist         is a gesture of unbearable intimacy; it is to feel the living pulse, for         one thing, and there the skin is very tender and translucent. It is startling         and touching to find one of Guests rare &quot;Is &quot; in this particular         poem. &quot;Orb&quot; is a freighted and beautiful word (Miltonic, Blakean)         which conveys the sometime awe and majesty, roundness and cosmic largeness         of the human eye? the muses eye? (the visionary eye that both gives off         light and takes in light). The &quot;writing lamp&quot; also lights and         is lit, and is both metaphorical and touchingly homely and literal. There         is everywhere here a melding of the eternal and the moment, the light         and the body. This is a moment of danger, of a painful &quot;blade&quot;         in the shoulder, and the painful withdrawal of that blade. This event         is so much and yet can just blow away like dust, leaving both nothing         and a potent sense of nothingness.

What does         it mean to have body, finger, wrist, shoulder, eye, paper utterly transformed         and then forsaken? After the word &quot;writing&quot; appears three times,         there is that bluntly cut off word and line: that writ -- that written         thing, a poem, a story? So powerfully monosyllabic and yet so briefly         present in the poem: &quot;that writ / blew away.&quot; &quot;Writ&quot;         has sacred and legal connotations; it sounds archaic, from those ages         when written things had a magic aura or power. &quot;It is writ,&quot;         implies that it has an incontrovertible legitimacy. Not just passing ordinary         life but something memorable and remembered: &quot;it is writ.&quot; She         connotes all that, and yet can follow (simply, casually, profoundly) with         &quot;blew away &#9;flame lit with nothing and nothingness stayed.&quot;         Writ or not, it is perishable. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">(Does a         trout, like a poem, subjected to philosophic speculation and discussion,         simply swim away, saving its own alien life?

One reason         the poetry feels nonreferential is the standoffishness of demonstrative         pronouns like this &quot;this,&quot; floating around unwedded to a noun;         but they could just as well be said to be promiscuous pronouns, briefly         consorting with any noun in the vicinity, or with the (ambiguous) point         the poem is making, or with the poem itself (&agrave; la William Shakespeare         in his sonnets), even with some referent outside the poem. (Therefore         more polyreferential than nonreferential  Bernsteins most useful distinction).         How hard it is to be told &quot;this changes&quot; and not know what &quot;this&quot;         is even as it presumably is becoming something else (<i>not </i>this anymore,         but that?) How can a reader hold on to the sense of what is being said         when ordinary, usually dependable taken-for-granted words like &quot;this&quot;         behave so evasively, begging the question of their own meaning and function,         clamoring for attention? (See Guests poem &quot;Outside of This, That         Is&quot; for a real pronominal and prepositional work-out). There is such         risk in allowing words like &quot;this&quot; so much lee-way. Most readers         dont expect it or like it; they have to get on with other things; and         yet how much might &quot;this&quot; reveal to us about language, about         space, about proximity and the here and now, if it were accorded at last         some attention for semantic as well as grammatical worth? </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where         to begin? Because there are two periods in the poem, and the poem seems         to be about &quot;the sentence,&quot; one might examine the workings of         the words preceding the periods to see how they behave as sentences about         sentences. Each of the two &quot;sentences&quot; is itself a frail construction         moved by some kind of seismic sway out of sentencely and sensical character         into something else. Is this a sentence? Look for a subject: &quot;sentence.&quot;         And a predicate: &quot;is cultivated,&quot; (such a fatally passive construction!)         Can we have any cultivating influence over our own sentences, our own         sense? Arent they made what they are by the absolutely &quot;seismic         sway of existence&quot; against which we try to assert the frail tools         of syntax? And also, by using the word &quot;cultivate&quot; which departs         from &quot;nature,&quot; is she also implying the whole cultural artifact         that language is? that our sentences are swayed by the many ways language         is understood outside of our particular intentions about and for it? Language         owned by no one. Language as &quot;socially constructed&quot; -- having         a seismic, quasi-natural &quot;sway&quot; of its own which is non- improvisatory,         operates by means of the security of the expected. History has been an         immense, long &quot;improvement&quot; and development of sentence-sense,         so that our sentences can say us, be &quot;outside us,&quot; rather than         us saying them, or directing them from within. Language (sentences) have         been practiced and cherished for so many years, how can one make a sentence         ones own? Does one want to, entirely or always? Charles Bernstein : &quot;Sentences         that follow standard grammatical patterns allow the accumulating references         to enthrall the reader by diminishing diversions from a constructed representation.         In this way, each words references work in harmony by reinforcing a spatiotemporal         order conventionalized by the bulk of writing practice that creates the         standard.&quot; So Guest makes these frail sentences with non-standard         syntax, and risks unreadability. Strangely, they seem remarkably stout         in their insistence on taking on the whole seismic sway of existence!         (But hasnt poetry, with its line-breaks and inversions always more or         less stoutly challenged the authority and conventionality and linearity         of the sentence?)<br>        </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Inflammable&quot;         is such a precise, indispensable, and useful adjective for the noun &quot;Words&quot;         Does she imply that to write a poem or a sentence is to build using others         discarded bricks, which are nonetheless inflammable and dangerous to handle,         full of potential heat, excitable, ignitable?<br>        </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Is         there a poem on Guests desk of which this is a remnant or fragment, or         afterimage?

And does Guest find         the pumpkin particularly &quot;sweet&quot; because it is happily excused         from languages nets, prisons, qualifications, and failures and from knowledge         of its own or other pumpkins or the suns or summers or the farmers         certain death? Does she, like Whitman, admiring the animals, envy the         pumpkin its placidity and self-containment, its ability to evince plainly,         its eschewing of respectability and industriousness? Does the phrase say         that the pumpkin, who has no language therefore will feel no grief, or         that the pumpkin having no grief, therefore has no need of language? Does         it imply that human beings, creatures of grief and the alphabet, have         been given the alphabet in recompense for their sorrow at bereavement         and mortality, in order to create as they witness pervasive and irremediable         decreation? And does Guest imply that as a &quot;woman made out of words,&quot;         (to paraphrase Stevens) much sanity and perspective depends upon the pumpkin         repetitively living out its wordless days, forming and unforming, noticed         or not?</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The         Dolphin shimmeringly appears and disappears throughout the last section         of the book. I suspect that the Dolphin has been imagined by Guest as         her readers incentive and recompense, for glossing, for attending, for         immersion, for risking getting lost in her vast and complex experimental         sea. &quot;GLOSS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLOSS // point to the Mix,         and // there! it slides into view / the Dolphin, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//         <i>before</i> the moment oversteps, / into / the <i>hum</i> pour his ivory.&quot;         That prize Dolphin <i>does </i>&quot;slide into view&quot; (if only for         a moment) from his rich and alien world: and he is excitement, meaning,         intimacy, and connection (readerly rewards for hazarding this writerly         ocean), all sleek and wet and new. The book ends with a question, further         evidence that this is a poem intending to entangle and engage a reader         in questions about itself and about the nature of poetry, about how language         works or doesnt work, about dolphins and pumpkins and prepositions. <i>&quot;The         Dolphin God</i>  does he swim on the page?&quot; This is a poem that         begs an assurance, a response, a joking and caressing point of view, a         sigh of pleasure or sympathetic distress, a conversation with a reader         who writes.</font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">BIO</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">:         </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Sara         Lundquist is an associate professor of English at the University of Toledo,         in Ohio, where she teaches modern and contemporary poetry.
