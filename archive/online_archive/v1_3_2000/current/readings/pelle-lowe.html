Could we talk about         the relationship you might have with Derens work?</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL: </b>Its         difficult for me to think about the avant-garde in cinema in relation         to Maya Deren only, especially since my work has been so profoundly influenced         by the avant-garde that was created by Dada. One of the key Dada figures         was a woman named Emmy Hennings, whose voice had the legendary quality         of being able to enter listeners and transform them. Early avant-garde         was based on the voice as a form of embodied resistance to the kinds of         rationalism that led to the First World War. So, I really think the avant-garde         starts there. I also find it difficult to think of experimental film in         visual terms only because my own films dont really begin with the visual.         And its easier for me to think of Deren as, for example, an originator,         than as a motherwhich is a highly gendered term, in that there has also         to be a father.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b> Right, right.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>The other thing is that Maya Deren came to cinema through her experience         as a dancer, and through really trying to understand embodiment. The experience         of the body played into these sorts of altered states that she was trying         to speak about through cinema. I think that one of her most avant-garde         works had to do with her filming of the practices of Voudon.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:</b>         Described in <i>The Divine Horsemen</i>, right?</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>Yeah, that was the book. Her footage was eventually collected by her         friend, Ron Rice, I think. She studied with Gregory Bateson, one of the         early theoreticians of consciousness and what we now call &quot;otherness.&quot;         She had this extraordinary experience of being allowed into the practice         of possession, which she writes about in <i>The Divine Horsemen</i> as         a riveting, terrifying, and ultimately liberating experience. What interests         me about her as well as what interests me about Emmy Hennings is that         Deren was a woman who fearlessly let herself be taken possession of by         energies over which she had no control. She certainly danced in those         places I was attracted to and terrified of in my own life. So here was         a woman who was potentially capable of meeting me and, how should I say         this (pause)her own courage challenged me in a certain sense to take         personal risks with my own consciousness in filmmaking and performance.         But, the performance came before the filmmaking.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>For you or for Deren?</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>For me, yes and I believe this was also the case for Deren. She performed         in her own films and she was also interested, it seems to me, in understanding         the syntax and logic of dream language.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>She wrote that one of the attractions of film was that it allowed         her to work with the medium of time and space. She was clearly interested         in the fact that film language was inherently a poetic language. I wonder         what it was about film that allowed her to try to reproduce the phenomenon         of alterity.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>Deren, as a dancer, would necessarily have been interested in issues         of time and space, but I think her work with Bateson also implied that         her concepts of time and space had cultural relevance beyond what was         accepted in New York or in the United States or in the West. She pushed         herself to explore other forms of time, other forms of space.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Well, it seems to me that Derens exploration of non-Western experiences         of space and time does help us define the difference between avant-garde         or experimental film and mainstream film. Let me ask you a general question,         Pelle. How would you define avant-garde cinema? What does it do and what         does it ask the viewer to do? What is avant-garde cinema today?</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:</b>         First of all, I think that term is regarded now as an archaism. I dont         necessarily regard it that way. The term &quot;avant-garde&quot; had a         kind of military meaning, related to the experience of the First World         War, of the first &quot;shock troops&quot; in history. </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Yes, the &quot;shocked troops.&quot; Were the troops shocked or were         they determined to shock?</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>Wonderful. Both of course, and literally, given electroshock and forced         back into the war. There has been a lot of writing about the experience         of shock but this seems to be 20/20 hindsight to me. The people speaking         about the avant-garde were living it in a direct way. I dont think a         current avant-garde lives on that edge or has that experience. The shock,         if there is any sense of shock, seems repressed. I think there is still         a need for &quot;shock troops&quot; in the arts, but they may not come         from universities or the galleries or arts establishment. I think they         come from the margins, from the experience of marked people. People marked         by wars, by exploitation, by the experience of chronic fatigue that is         the experience of being used industrially. The shock of war is experienced         on industrial fronts, at the level of people who are virtually enslaved         to produce the technologies we take for granted. I think that were these         voices liberated, they would be the true avant-garde.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Well, we need a new vocabulary. Were using the term &quot;war,&quot;         as it was defined by Modernism, but were talking about our own contemporary         moment, right? The seizure of late stage capitalism that has us all in         its thrall? Maybe we should shift the notion of an &quot;avant-garde,&quot;         or an experimental cinema from a political reference to an aesthetic or         technical description. When you talk to students who are not already film         students, how do you define the genre of experimental film? What makes         a film experimental?</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>I try to define an experience using whatever means I have at hand         to say what I had been taught not to say. To voice things I feel in my         body and have not heard articulated in culture.To my way of thinking,         the making of experimental works simply means trying to forget about what         you are told you can or cannot do with an idea. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN: </b>Isnt         it interesting how this kind of work is perceived as &quot;difficult&quot;         by the mainstream, as difficult or weird or not film or poetry at all?         It sometimes seems strange to share a language with such a small group         of people.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>The experiment is not in the making of the work. The experiment is         finding out who resonates with your work. It is an act of faith to say         that I am going to speak for myself in order to see where who hears me.         Where are the people who speak my language? Thats the real experiment.         </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Yes, yes.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>Then taking what you have done in the dark for yourself and putting         it out, being that vulnerable just in order to see whether there are other         people who can catch that slender line that you have cast.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>So the experiment is a process and not a technique?

It was computer generated. An English artist named David Larcher         did it. He was using cliches of high tech video along with what we call         artifacts or noise in video, glitches and elliptical texts in a brilliant         way. I wish you wouldnt ask me this because I cannot answer it well.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Okay maybe we can answer it by talking about your work more specifically.         Lets talk about what you were doing in <i>Chintz</i> (1990). You seem         to have two distinct streams going on in your films, a sound stream and         a visual stream. Can you talk a bit about the way that you used sounds         here? For example, the film begins with jungle sounds, and then it opens         into a Gilbert and Sullivan opera (laughing). It sounded very colonial         or imperial to me, Then you use this song &quot;the flowers that bloom         in the spring&quot;</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>Tra la!</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>And then we hear the baying of wolves laid on top of the image of         undulating chintz draperies--my favorite moment in the film. Nature entrapped         by visual and aural cliches. And of course the sound stream goes on and         on. How does sound inspire the way you work with images or how do images         inspire your choices of sound? </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>I guess we are getting back to poetry in film because I never really         know which I start with. Chintz was a mid-life crisis film, quite frankly.         It was utterly menopausal.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I had had         a sudden realization that as an older woman I was becoming quite invisible         culturally. I felt an enormous amount of regret about the way in which         I had allowed myself to be defined, as a young woman, by the reaction         of others. I felt that I had been colonized in a weird way and then I         also felt suddenly marginalized, as if I was someone who was no longer         of use to the colonial interests. So Gilbert and Sullivan, I dont know         how they came to mind. Perhaps I was listening to a radio show, but I         was struck by the fact that they were writing these operettas at the height         of British colonialism and yet there seemed to be a subversive content         to their work. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In any case,         I found myself wandering around New York City and my plan was to get as         drunk as possible and to get lost in the subway system. And here is what         is strange. Every time I emerged from the subway I seemed to know where         I was. What a weird experience. It was as if I couldnt escape what was         happening to me, or escape knowing where I was in a city that had always         seemed foreign to me. A certain self-knowledge that accrued with a sudden         knowledge of place. So, having failed at getting lost I found a cheap         hotel. It seems it was a welfare hotel, although it was listed in the         guidebook as &quot;a hotel where women stay.&quot; And it was called the         Empire Hotel (laughs).</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:</b>         Perfect.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>I shot a lot of the scenes there. A lot of the camera movement had         to with the fact that I was either drunk or hungover or both. Chintz,         of course, refers to the cloth I always associated with old ladies as         a child. Chintz also means &quot;cheap,&quot; but the origin of the word         came from colonial England, which imported fabrics from India that were         made for quick consumption. This concept of feeling &quot;cycled through&quot;         a culture that defined me as a woman and then suddenly spit me out was         the basis for making this film. The disjunction of sound and image has         always seemed right to me at the time since nothing that I was seeing         seemed to match up with anything that I was thinking. </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:</b>         You once told me that you edited to music and that listening to music          not necessarily something you were putting into a soundtrack--really         had an effect on the way you were cutting a film and working with images<b>.</b></font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>I cant say that Ive ever been a great fan of Gilbert and Sullivanit         was the perversity that arose at the momentmaybe an act of self-hatred.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">CN: But         theres also something intuitively right about that choice, since, in         fact, youre talking about being colonized as a middle-aged woman, a woman         who winds up staying in the Empire hotel. Those connections seem to fit         brilliantly with the Gilbert and Sullivan music.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>I took some of my images from Valentinos <i>The Sheik</i>--a wonderful         and totally absurd film about British gentlemen imagining themselves as         dashing sheiks. I felt that whatever potential I had for being exotic         had been permanently lost.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Theres a comical juxtaposition between the Valentino footage and         the footage of your bedsheets in the bed youre staying in--this movement         between his desert and yours, between the hyperbole of Valentino and the         abjectness of the moment youre documenting in this rat-trap hotel.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>The text of the music has to do with unrequited passion and so the         way that the sheets folded into the desert was quite convenient in terms         of cutting, but I had also intended to imply the desert of the empty bed.         I went several times to film at the glass flower collection at the Peabody         Museum at Harvard, which struck me as a purely nineteenth century idea.         I mean, who on earth would ever spend so much time blowing highly detailed         glass flowers? I had considerable difficulty filming there. I had to go         in several times with my camera concealed.

I can remember going         to this rose garden in November and photographing them as they were dying.         The sound that you hearthe screaming soundis the sound of a teakettle         boiling over, a kind of metaphor for my own alienated sexuality.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>How much of that wonderful juxtaposition of thingssheets and Valentino,         music especiallyhow much of that is just luck, accident?

In thinking about it, I realized I had repressed,         as an artist, my own grieving for the loss of my daughter. </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Kashi.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>Yes. And the other major impetus as you may know had to do with a         piece of poetry you shared with me that touched me enormously. The language         seemed to intuit my own experience of loss on such a direct level that         it gave me permission to think of myself as being capable of making a         film about something that I thought was unspeakable in any other way.         Im speaking about the eroticism that arises out of intense grief. One         is expected to suffer loss in a certain way and to eliminate other impulses,         such as sexual desire or sexual impulsiveness. I started thinking about         this when I started thinking about the Gulf War, about all the women who         lost their lovers, all the women who were murdered in this war. The fact         that it was not spoken about as loss, but as &quot;collateral damage,&quot;         was unbearable to me. I had to speak. I had to find a way of addressing         a complicated set of emotions that related not only to the loss of my         daughter but to the loss of myself as an artist. If I survived as an artist,         did my survival imply that as a mother I had sacrificed my daughter to         my art? Any woman, I suppose, who has been an artist and a mother has         had these complex feelings. So the problem for me was how to speak about         feelings for which I had no words. </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b><i>Earthly Possessions </i>is an unfashionably lyrical and romantic         piece. For example, it purports &quot;to know&quot; through emotion and         to trust the possibility that emotion is the starting place for a kind         of inquiry. You start with emotion and develop it into a cycle of feeling         that takes you somewhere. There is a certain moment where it seems like         the film could end and then it repeats itself and we go on into another         layer of grief. I was thinking about your lyricism in this film vis &agrave;         vis postmodernism. It seems to me that postmodernism and especially postmodernist         writing distrusts the idea of &quot;the passions,&quot; or even a knowable         subject. It seems concerned instead with phenomenological questions of         subject position, or with the &quot;process&quot; of perception and how         that process, in fact, constructs the self, instead of the other way around--that         the self constructs perception. </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>When I began working on this film I had spent a number of years as         a performance artist and was very interested in ideas of transgression.         There is nothing to shock the bourgeoisie with anymore, since shocking         the bourgeoisie is, in fact, a bourgeois matter. One of my deliberations         or experiments in making this film was to see what modes of feeling were         transgressive in the culture at the moment. Since &quot;coolness&quot;         was the style of the moment I decided not to be cool. So it seemed that         the real transgression was in bringing voice to emotions that were not         acceptable to contemporary hip culture </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>The unacceptable emotion was what?</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL: </b>A         kind of loss of control of that grieving. You know you can expose any         part of your body but you cannot expose any part of your emotion. Such         as the desire to fuck at a funeral. </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>To fuck at a funeral?</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>Right. Why is it that people who are in the midst of immense grief         are suddenly erotically charged? And I also wanted to explore that. That         is to explore the ways that we refuse grief by cleaning it up, limiting         it to a few chaste tears when grief can be a profound connection with         all that is living. That is its ameliorative, its healing potential and         what we lose in our refusal to grieve is the possibility of the erotic         connection in life. I used the tropes of romantic literature because I         felt that so much of that was an invention of women whose emotions had         been suppressed. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was my first model for         the film. That story has always struck me as a story of impermissible         love and impermissible grieving. </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Well, its gothic and messyit has a haunted, brutal quality to it.         </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>But that brutality is inherent in romanticism.

You have the potential to be gendered in a number of ways, ultimately         as Herculine Barbin was, as a hermaphrodite. Also the film is an alchemical         text for me. One of the central figures of alchemy is the hermaphrodite,         a being who moves through a number of worlds.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Well, you have these two figures, the Nelly figure from &quot;Wuthering         Heights,&quot; the woman in the cap with the lamp who moves across the         frame from right to left, and the cross-dressed figure, who sits in front         of a mirror putting on facial hair and who transforms herself in the course         of the film into a man. You play both figures. </font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>One of the things that saddens me about heterosexual eroticism is         its limitations. People always talk about wanting to exchange roles but         they never really do because they are too frightened. Nelly was a kind         of go-between and she also carried the history of Cathy and Heathcliff.         I always made this figure move from right to left because it is against         the direction of reading and against the direction of history. A movement         deliberately into a different cycle. She is united with images of the         moon and the mirror that appear and reappear in the film-- and shes the         figure of a rotating mother of time.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>At the end of <i>Chintz</i> you also have this image of older women         dancing.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>This dancing older woman also appears in another film of mine, <i>Bottom         Line (</i>1995). </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Bottom         Line </i>has to do with the death of the city in relation to opposing         market capital. There is a homeless woman who dances through the film.         I shot a lot of it during the depression of 1989 with all of these businessmen         staring horrified at the tickertape and they were extremely angry with         me for shooting it and in fact I was &quot;shooting&quot; them. I have         seen a lot of these women just cutting loose, dancing in the streets,         as performers. For me, they seem to be figures of an ancient archetype         related to the myth of Demeter. Of course the myth of Demeter is important         to me because like Demeter I lost my daughter, but the key figure for         Demeter is Baubo. In her grief, Demeter has become an old woman, a hag.         She is met by a serving woman named Baubo. The shift for Demeter comes         when this serving woman tells Demeter jokes and stories and finally lifts         her skirts or moons her and at that point Demeter has the strength to         go on and to confront Zeus and lay out the deal: &quot;Give me back my         daughter or I will disrupt the cycles of birth and death<b>. </b>So these         older women, these jokesters on the street, have always been a great source         of delight and courage for me.

How has performance         been a primary place for creativity for you? How did you start to do performance         work?</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>It started as a reaction against an insensitive use of imagery about         women that I saw in college. When I protested a performance by a man stabbing         a female effigy I was told I was attacking free speech. The only way I         could think of to stand my ground and continue to make my point was in         fact to &quot;detour&quot; the event. I invited the man who had staged         the performance to do a piece of work with me, which he willingly did.         I wondered about this. I felt at first as if I had entrapped him but at         a certain point realized I had some agency in the matter, in the way I         could use an art form I was not familiar with. I was the photographer         for the piece.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Do you remember what year this was?</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>1987 I think. That was really my first experiment with performance.         I had been doing photography and installation. I was interested in ideas         about identity, memory, and silence. But I was also incensed by the unwillingness         of the university to look at sexism as an issue. So the whole beginning         of the performance was a matter of outrage. I also realized I could produce         images as a form of argument.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Tell me about <i>Textasy</i>? That is a recent performance piece.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>Part of <i>Textasy</i> came from a performance that originated around         1989 called <i>Phantom Limb</i> in which I downloaded text from cyberspace         sex sites and conversations from phone sex lines and coupled them, so         to speak (laughs). What I was really interested in at the time was the         way in which cybersex represented a loss of attachment to the body. Also         a loss of attachment to the emotions of the body, and of the inscriptions         in the body of human contact. So a large part of that performance was         created by literally re-inscribing grooves into a phonograph record with         a needle, to improvise a new text. The recording was Garbo reading from         <i>Queen Christina, </i>in which she is acting out the part of a man and         she is also trying to remember her one experience of real love. And in         the process of this performance the recording is eventually erased by         being played again and again. This is my way of talking about the way         that the infinite repeatability of experience and the rapidity of its         repetition, as we find in cybersex or phonesex or any recorded experience,         ultimately erases the originary experience.<b> </b>It seems that I return         again and again to themes of the marking in the body of experience and         identity and the meaning of its loss.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Are you speaking of the loss of the mark?</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>No, the loss of lived experience.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>CN:         </b>Which is often known to us through our marks.</font></p>      <p> <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PL:         </b>Right, and the loss of lived experience is precisely what is celebrated         in cyberculture in a certain way.
