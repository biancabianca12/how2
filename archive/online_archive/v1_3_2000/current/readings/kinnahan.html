During the conference,         I led one of two sections of a seminar entitled &quot;Modernist and Contemporary         Women Poets,&quot; a topic I had suggested to the conference organizers         as a way of foregrounding the production and reception of women poets         in relationship to modernism and its legacies. Originally scheduled as         one seminar, the topic drew so many participants that the conference organizers         divided it into two sessions, and Lynn Keller was gracious enough to lead         the second seminar devoted to this topic. The popularity of the seminars         attests to the critical vitality and energy generated by the study of         women’s poetry, the richness and diversity of twentieth-century poetry         by women, and the necessity to continue our efforts to re-read the intersections         of gender, reception, and production in twentieth-century poetries. </font>       <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The seminar         format proved to be wonderfully fruitful. Each participant, represented         here with the exception of one (Jeanne Heuving, whose excellent paper         will appear elsewhere), wrote a short paper that was shared with all other         participants before the conference. Thus, when we met for a two-hour discussion,         we had all seen each other’s work and were relieved of the pressure of         actually &quot;presenting&quot; a paper. This format opened space for         discussion characterized by unexpected turns, multiple voices, thinking         on the spot, and generally high energy. It was exhausting and fascinating         at once, and I am grateful to each and every participant for her generosity         of spirit and intellect as we navigated the issues brought up in discussion         and the essays. Contributing immensely to the seminar’s liveliness and         stimulating content was a group of invited &quot;guest&quot; participants,         poets and scholars who had graciously and enthusiastically agreed to take         part in our discussion. My thanks to Rachel Blau Du Plessis, Linda Wagner-Martin,         Lynn Keller, and Kathleen Fraser for joining the group and providing invaluable         perspectives developed from their incredible pioneering, bridging, unending         work on modernist and contemporary poetry by women.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When I came         up with the topic, I was selfishly interested in discussing interests         of my own, which have focused on the resonance of reading modernist writers         against, beside, in relation to contemporary poets. This, for me, has         not been a question of lineage but of reading practices. What do we learn         from reading a contemporary woman working innovatively with language and         form that helps us to (re)read Stein or Moore, for example? How do the         recuperation and negotiation of innovative practices within strains of         modernism enable / limit / inflect the works of contemporary women exploring         language, form, and gender? How is &quot;experimentation&quot; to be received,         contextualized, politicized? Although I had no clear map of directions         that the seminar might take, these and other amorphous concerns certainly         shaped my expectations. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">However,         the papers I read surprised and delighted me by exceeding my expectations,         especially in asking us all to think in difficult ways about critical         practices. As a way of introducing these splendid essays -- which represent         works-in-progress and are often purposefully tentative, partial, exploratory,         and risky -- I’d like to sum up some of my reactions to the papers as         a group and then pose some of the questions that came out of the discussion.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Critical         anxieties leapt out at me from these essays. In some, a sense of belatedness         in reading innovative texts emerged, a questioning of whether categories         and practices engaged as &quot;feminist&quot; had ossified, of whether         the project of re-reading women’s &quot;experimental&quot; texts had itself         become exhausted. Is what was new, obscure, and exciting ten years ago         now an overworked field, or seeming so? Or is there a community of readers         trying to figure out just what the community is? While not explicit, this         set of impressions lingered for me within the group of essays as a whole,         and I wondered if this anxiety was a product of a critical apparatus that         encourages the &quot;new&quot; and the &quot;original&quot; to the extent         that this drive supersedes the critical tasks of (re)claiming, identifying,         and historicizing. I wondered if there was a feeling of &quot;post&quot;         (as in &quot;post-feminist,&quot; &quot;post-subversive,&quot; &quot;post-experimental&quot;)         before lots of necessary work had been done, a feeling I’ve had recently         at conferences where it seems implicitly pass&eacute; to address issues         like gender (an &quot;oh, haven’t we already been there&quot; feeling).         This is not to say that the seminar essays took up this position but that         they seemed somehow and subtly aware of it. Linda Russo, for example,         questions the status of &quot;subversive&quot; in feminist literary discourse,         while Elizabeth Savage turns the lens of critical practice upon her own         efforts to &quot;read&quot; Riding and Retallack. Elisabeth Frost’s essay         usefully models a critical direction that strives to keep the resistant         potential of feminist readings vital, in arguing for a &quot;greater understanding         of submerged traditions of resistance, both textual and political.&quot;         Susan Rosenbaum’s essay insists upon cultural contexts and feminist reception         as part of a necessary gendered critique. Debbie Mix’s essay asks whether         in our critical practice we have moved from &quot;recognition&quot; to         &quot;codification,&quot; wondering how we continue the work of recognizing/claiming         &quot;trails&quot; of feminist poetics rather than codifying them?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Three main         areas of concern emerged within this nexus of what I’m calling critical         anxiety, although even as I write this, I’m conscious of oversimplifying         the richness of the essays and the afternoon’s interchange. One area had         to do with critical authority and institutional forces. Given the nature         of the academy and its attendant pressures upon scholarly production,         how does one practice scholarship and in what form? What critical and         poetic boundaries remain in force, shaping how we write, who we write         about, and where we choose to try to publish or speak? How does the dissemination         of materials and access to them affect production, particularly for the         scholars who possess little authority, money, or institutional support?         Secondly, and not without relationship to academic structures, questions         of HOW TO READ became pressing. In asking what happens to the process         of reading modernism through contemporary women’s writing, numerous essays         voiced the need to recognize the apparatus by which we identify structures         we have for reading. Elizabeth Savage and Kathleen Crown wonder about         ways of reading the &quot;unsaid,&quot; while Jeanne Heuving and Kathleen         explore methods of &quot;lifting&quot; in both critical and poetic practice,         of recontextualizing prior sayings in radically refigured texts. Lesley         Wheeler brings the revision of feminine associations into view through         an unexpected pairing of &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;experimental&quot;         poetics that asks us to think of what we mean by those categories. Finally,         the essays, perhaps rather than/as part of expressing critical anxiety,         seemed finely attuned to questions of critical self-consciousness: how         do we read ourselves and the ethics of our critical acts? how do critical         needs determine readings? how do we act responsibly to recognize the role         we play as critics, particularly in writing about living poets? how do         the ethical dimensions and roles of the critic enter into our teaching         of women’s poetry, of feminist reception, and as Rachel Blau Du Plessis         insisted during the afternoon discussion, in articulating not only gender         but social location, in locating gender in institutional and social contexts?         in what ways will new forms of technology shape or press upon our activities         as readers, writers, critics? and what might gender have to do with all         of this?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This brings         me back to the question of community. As the seminar participants enacted         community on that afternoon in State College, PA. I was struck with the         ripple effect of reading communities, imagining each woman returning to         a classroom, a pen, a computer, where her reading and questioning and         critical reflexivity would contribute to ever-new narratives emerging         -- not as grist for the tenure mill -- but as enabling frameworks of concepts         and histories that must constantly be revisited. Honestly, as the seminar         discussion ended, it marked the first utopic moment I’d had in a long         time, and I like to hold tight to it and all of its attendant polemical,         ethical, and intellectual energy. My thanks to you all.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Part         II of &quot;Modernist and Contemporary Women Poets&quot; will appear in         the next issue, drawing upon essays discussed in the seminar led by Lynn         Keller.</i></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>BIO</b>:         Linda A.
