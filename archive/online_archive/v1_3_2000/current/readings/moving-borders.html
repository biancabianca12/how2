The two periods in which women         wielded the most power to create the conditions for their own writing         and its reception--early Modernism (1910-30), and the re-emergence of         women's poetic communities in the 70s and 80s provided--us with particularly         rich territory to explore.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The course         hypothesized that these two moments are dialectically interwoven; Modernist         innovators such as Moore, H.D., Gertrude Stein, and Lorine Niedecker helped         make contemporary women's poetry possible, and in the last thirty years,         recovery work by feminist literary historians, critics, and, importantly,         poets, helped make Modernist women's innovations legible. <i>Moving Borders</i>,         which both participates in and records this dialectic, was our textbook         for three weeks of the course. Students struggled with the disjunctive         poetries sampled in the anthology, fought over the book's "feminist" goals         and uses and, as poets and critics themselves, questioned their roles         in furthering the <i>Moving Borders</i> project.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>How does         the amorphousness or open-form editing of <i>Moving Borders </i>affect         our reception of it in the classroom, as students?</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I think         that the &quot;Poetics and Exposition&quot; section of this anthology         is tremendously useful, but the anthology is not organized in a way that         makes that apparent. The organization (or lack thereof&#150;there seems         to be some kind of &quot;statement&quot; even in that) does not lend itself         to classroom use. Perhaps a reorganization would make the anthology more         practical. For example, place each writer&#146;s &quot;poetics and exposition&quot;         next to her poetry. I also think a &quot;user&#146;s manual&quot; and         a list of additional sources would be tremendously useful and would make         this anthology less daunting. Sometimes &quot;tried and true&quot; isn&#146;t         so bad. I think that innovation for the sake of innovation can defeat         a larger and more important purpose.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Also, if         Sloan feels the need to justify why she devoted so little space to certain         writers (i.e. novelists and dramatists)&#150;decidedly INNOVATIVE writers&#150;then         she&#146;s obviously aware that there&#146;s a problem. Perhaps this began         as an anthology of POETRY and then she (or they) realized that was too         exclusive?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Overall,         as I read </i>Moving Borders<i> I got a real sense of significance, of         importance in what these women writers, and Sloan herself are trying to         do in terms of moving borders, revisioning, redefining, and questioning.         Sloan&#146;s construction of the anthology, the font, the typesetting,         even the table of contents, visually reinforce the sense of experimentation         that the writers do in their poetry and expository writing.</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Clearly,         Sloan tries not to draw definitive borders in her formation of this anthology.         The chronological order of the poetry, the &quot;conversational sequence&quot;         of the expository pieces, the lack of biographical information (with the         exception of the brief list of publications by each author, their current         place of residence, and the small reference Sloan makes regarding the         number of writers who are mothers) seek to force the reader to react to         the writing and not the authors themselves or their personal lives, which         often occurs when critics examine work by women. Even with textual layout,         there is a real sense of dissolving borders. On the front cover we encounter         the powdery yellow sheen, not pink or blue, but yellow, a color associated         with being gender neutral. We also see a collage by Alice Notley, again         a symbol of undefined space, of neutrality, the colors blurring. </i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>However,         while the borders may begin to blur, they are still present. Sloan does         draw a firm line; this anthology only consists of &quot;innovative writing         by women.&quot; For readers the gender border is clearly defined. Sloan,         along with the writers themselves, asks us to change the way we read by         manipulating form, text, genre, etc.</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>While         wildly different in look, tone, and theme, virtually all of the <i>Moving         Borders</i> selections conform to the principles delineated in Hejinian&#146;s         "Rejection of Closure." Sloan might be said to engage in "open text" editing         as well. The irony of her practice is that in refraining from the standard,         sometimes self-aggrandizing, sometimes hagiographic interventions of the         anthology editor (biographical/critical headnotes, footnotes, a poetics         section set in a specifically explanatory relationship to the poetry)         Sloan ends up producing a text that feels CLOSED, an art-for-art's sake         coterie in conversation solely within itself.</u></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>Compared         to <i>Moving Borders</i>, Bonnie Kime Scott's editorially interventionist         anthology <i>The Gender of Modernism </i>was much more successful at<i>         </i>eliciting "gender-alert, materialist-inflected reception" in our classroom         environment. <i>GOM</i> worked because it provided a sense of social context         and a series of scholarly portals into the primary material. <i>Moving         Borders</i> (in spite of the variety of poetry it contains and its well-meaning         effort to avoid potential elitism of the "academic") ends up feeling like         a monolith, motivated by purely aesthetic concerns and commonalities.         </u> </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#FF0000">I         didn&#146;t know much about language poetry until I had my hands on this         book, and I certainly didn&#146;t know this many women were involved.         I&#146;m still in my <i>No More Masks</i> level of poetic/feministic inquiry         -- no more masks is important in a way that I can grasp immediately.

Were they?         What&#146;s the difference between being feminist and doing feminist work,         and when and by whom does this get decided? In her "Comment on Marjorie         Perloff" (delivered at the Barnard College Conference in April and reprinted         in HOW2 no. 2) Rachel Blau DuPlessis usefully reframes these questions:         </u> </font></p>      <dir>         <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;<u>To           maintain feminist (or gender alert) RECEPTION is crucial, not to insist           that certain forms, styles, strategies, subjectivities, themes are more           female, feminine, male, masculine, gay, straight on the level of <i>production</i>           ...Gender-alert, materialist inflected reception is interested in the           discussion of social location not only of artists, but of genres, discourses,           images, textualities, ideologies, communities.</u></font></p>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>"Gender-alert,         materialist-inflected reception"--this is a practice that seems worth         engaging, but not, DuPlessis insists, at the cost of denying "our collective         debt to feminism."</u></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I keep asking         myself, if I had simply picked up this anthology outside the context of         this class (a class called GENDER and Authority), would I have read this         poetry from a feminist perspective? Certainly some of it lends itself         to such readings, but so do certain selections in traditional anthologies.         The very title chosen for this anthology predisposes the reader to read         these works as such because it states up-front that the volume contains         innovative writing <i>by women</i>. What if it were simply subtitled <i>Three         Decades of Innovative Writing</i>? What if the editor had chosen to use         only the last names and first initials of the authors? How would we read         it differently? Certainly the more well-known contributors to the volume         would have been immediately recognizable based on their works and last         names, but we must remember that anthologies are normally used in classrooms         which include students who might be very new to some of this work. I&#146;m         certainly new to some of it&#150;especially the language poets.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#FF0000">&quot;Feminism         failed because women are thieves.

If the text has no power, but the writer         does, and the writer is a woman. . .hasn&#146;t feminism succeeded? <i>Moving         Borders</i> works in ways that I&#146;m still figuring out. These women         are in conversation, sometimes direct dialogue with each other. Is the         writing in this text necessarily womanly/feminist? No. . .that&#146;s         the importance of the text.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>I think         that we can not escape the fact that these are women, and that while not         clearly defined as a feminist project, it is inherently feminist.This         anthology is by no means static; in fact when I read it I feel a real         sense of borders still dynamic, moving, and questioning and this is one         reason why I see read this as a feminist anthology. The writers included         successfully question the &quot;constitution of meaning in writing, reading,         and experiences&quot; (6). They investigate the &quot;nature of subjectivity,         persona, self , and selfs seen or framed in a lens, a narrative otherwise         . . .boundaries of poetry, narrative, novels, and plays, the territory         where proposition and prosody are indistinguishable&quot; (6). &#147;These         writers examine aphysicality, the body, . . .what is seen and what is         seeing&#148; (6). If we read this anthology as a historical artifact as         Sloan directs, then the plethora of questions regarding position and boundary,         which &quot;permeate every level of these writings,&quot; can be seen         as nothing other than feminist, since feminism historically has been the         catalyst for this kind of questioning. And, knowing this from my academic         training, it is nearly impossible to separate these women from their gender         and from a feminist reading. As Sloan says, &quot;Reading is not neutral;         readers locate writing within contexts&quot; (3).</i></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#FF0000">&quot;.         . .the radical is always contextual . . .&quot; (Sloan 3).

No. . .I&#146;m glad it does. I&#146;m still         not sure about the praxis, but I&#146;m all for the exposure of all of         these different women and their individual and collective idea/ls and         voices.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Is there         such a thing as "women's writing?"

They don&#146;t want linearity. In fact, Irigaray&#146;s<i>         This Sex Which is Not One</i> includes a chapter called "The &#145;Mechanics&#146;         of Fluids" in which she is basically getting across the same idea that         Hejinian hints at when she mentions the old "form is to content as glass         is to wine" and dismisses it basically. I&#146;m trying to figure out         the point of departure and it seems that Hejinian is simply not calling         her "fluid" writing "feminine"&#150;she&#146;s not associating it with         femininity or with feminism, although she actually hints toward this in         the Elaine Marks stuff (where she&#146;s invoking Kristeva through Marks).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>I'm concerned         that <i>Moving Borders</i> leans too heavily on the production side. That         is, rather than historicizing and making accessible potentially empowering         social formations, it priveleges certain "forms, styles, strategies,"         particularly what Lyn Hejinian calls "open text" writing that, citing         Irigaray, "diverts the linearity of a project...explodes the polarization         of desire on only one pleasure, and disconcerts fidelity to only one discourse"         (619). Such writing, Hejinian maintains in her now-classic defense of         language writing practice, "invites participation, rejects the authority         of the writer over the reader and thus, by analogy, the authority implicit         in other...hierarchies" (ibid.) But that's not what happens here, and         I think this has alot to do with the anthology form itself.</u></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#FF0000">As         a student initially unfamiliar with the larger body of innovative writing,         the anthology led me to assume that <i>all</i> the writing in the collection         was <i>necessarily</i> gendered writing, women's writing. I think the         reason I liked Kathleen Fraser&#146;s essay "The Tradition of Marginality"         so much was because she (and <i>HOW(ever)</i>) opened up questions of         language and gender, and allowed for the fact that men could appropriate         women&#146;s writing (i.e. it&#146;s not necessarily feminine or feminist         or anything else). <i>Moving Borders</i> doesn't do this.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Audience,         accessibility, elitism--what are the politics of reading here?

I&#146;m getting closer to understanding         the &quot;praxis&quot; of their work&#150;though I still don&#146;t feel         it&#146;s necessarily feminist&#150;but to appreciate it you still have         to have, if not a good education, at least a lot of time on your hands.         How can this speak to the working class, or lower?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In "Irony         and Postmodern Poetry," Armantrout says that "Pretending to be less intelligent         than one is interests me because it mimics the effects of psychological         denial and ideological repression." This leads me to question her poetry         in terms of this statement. Is that one of the things she&#146;s trying         to do? Is she trying to pretend to be less intelligent than she is? She         cites the poem by Charles Bernstein as an example and then goes on to         say that the "statements...may not tell a continuous story" and suggests         that they are similar to benign or inane small talk ("dinner-table monologue").         Can this be read as a sort of reverse elitism which, ironically, is also         elitist?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#FF0000">And         we can&#146;t use the master&#146;s tools to break down the master&#146;s         house, so oppositional poetics necessarily must be outside of the mainstream,         must be in a marginalized place, a place with nothing in common with the         current forms of domination. But isn&#146;t domination present in language,         period? Are there any ways, truly, to move to &#145;otherhow&#146;?

She goes on to say, "Perhaps a book         such as this marks the occasion when, at the <i>end</i> of a period of         historical transition, such a book is no longer necessary.

Often women are not recognized for their innovation;         men are traditionally seen as the innovators and women are delineated         to the role of impersonator. But this anthology overwhelmingly proves         that these women, alongside men, and sometimes leading the men, have been         influencing the evolution of poetics in modern American poetry.</i></font></p>      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>But         </i>Moving Borders<i> is by no means completely a historical document         to study the progression (to borrow Niedecker&#146;s title) of women&#146;s         writing in this century.

While there may be an &quot;equivalent&quot; number         of women publishing alongside men, many of these women are still getting         their first break by publishing in small journals edited by other innovative         women writers. While the content of the poetry in </i> Moving Borders<i>         may not always directly relate to the issues of production and feminist         identity politics, the strategies employed by these writers to get their         work published constitutes a feminist examination of their work. These         strategies still exist within academia and within the world of publishing.         These women are innovative not just because they question borders in poetry,         construction of meaning, and genre, but because of how they managed to         get their work recognized. As Sloan explains, &quot;Women innovative writers         began editing magazines, forming presses, organizing reading series and         symposia, teaching workshops, and running poetry centers and projects,         thus developing resources to which they indisputably had access and participating         more directly in the control of the means of production&quot; (5). These         women offer an interesting solution for young female scholars like myself,         &quot;If you can&#146;t beat &#145;em, then go start your own game and         don&#146;t worry about beating them.&quot;</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Why is the         "significant number" of women publishing any more striking than, say,         the increase in the number of women in the workforce? Or in the academy?         It is simply a FACT. It is simply a fabulous result of the resurgence         of the women&#146;s movement 30 years ago. I can&#146;t help but return         to the idea that if women keep positioning themselves as separate or on         the periphery or somehow &quot;different,&quot; then they will continue         to be viewed as such. Is this really what we want?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#FF0000">If         we are finally at a point when this book can be published, then it is         no longer needed in the same way that the poetry itself may have originally         been needed. But the fact that it is available (and not needed) opens         up important questions... feminism / feminists / activists have an important         place in literary history (and in my heart and mind&#150;I&#146;m sure         I&#146;m not alone) but they shouldn&#146;t be the only canon-makers and         keepers of women&#146;s literature. Success may be in saying that feminism         has failed, while continuing to write out of a woman&#146;s own experience,         just the way she wants to. . .as Dodie Bellamy does.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>I think         two different editorial imperatives account for the temporal gap between         Sloan's introductory statements. In the first instance, Sloan occupies         the traditional role of anthology editor as literary agent and advocate,         advancing the work of her contributors in the positive, present-tense,         optimistically universal space of reading. In the second instance, Sloan         is on the defensive. She&#146;s justifying the seeming oxymoron of an         anthology of innovative writing edited at least in part according to identitarian         principles. But it still seems sad to watch Sloan both produce and negate         her ambitious collection on its first page. And it seems sad from a gendered         perspective, or even a feminist one&#150;though this last is not a stance         the anthology concerns itself with examining or propounding.</u></font></p>      <hr>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Bios:</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Libbie         Rifkin</b> teaches 20th century American poetry and culture at the University         of Alabama.
