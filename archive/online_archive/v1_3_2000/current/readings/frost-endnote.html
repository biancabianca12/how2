It was a focus not just of         this unusually informal and informed gathering but also of our inquiries         into the work of women poets spanning the century. Modernism and its legacies;         the construction of tradition; ambivalence toward precursors; jockeying         for position in (or out of?) the canon -- as we talked about the back-and-forth         of influence and lineage, I couldn’t help thinking that the very label         &quot;modernism&quot; -- not to mention the elusive &quot;postmodernism&quot;         -- had little meaning. That I was more interested in this model of on-going         discussion, of deliberately unfinished business, of feminist inquiry across         the expected lines of category and canon. In conversations like this one.</font>       </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;As a         rule conferences involve lots of speaking, lots of listening, and little         dialogue.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Were         we actually<i> doing</i> this?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;And         then too there were the anxieties over my anxieties. First of all, about         loosening the grip (stranglehold?) of academese on my writing and thinking.         What would happen if this kind of dialogue were incorporated into my critical         prose? How would the conventions of what I have been trained to do fundamentally         alter in the nether-spaces of what I still see as bizarre new means of         sending and obtaining information -- this web, this journal?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;A friend         declares, &quot;I will go to my grave knowing nothing about this<i> comcom         dotdot,</i> and I’m just fine.&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Novelty,         lack of closure -- <i>dialogue</i>. Anxiety over, rejection of, the things         embraced by the alternative feminist traditions <i>I</i> embrace. I haven’t         worked this through, but that is probably appropriate. After all, one         of the most important insights of our discussion was that expanding, but         not reifying, the canon, the conversation, the dialogue, is crucial. And,         as Kathleen Fraser puts it, feeling &quot;familied&quot; among other women         poets and critics, past and present, who are enmeshed in dialogue, who         want to connect, who are willing to experiment. With such forums. With         such forms and languages. As <i>com</i>.
