To manifest and digest and play and flail         and heave and be. To put thought back in our gut, let the head take a         ride on the spine and not always lead the parts. This talking, talking,         talking; this formulating is old, tired. We know it, as walls, as structure-building;         as void of content.

That is a difficult proposition at times when the democratization         of matter and the resulting expansion of capitalism into the personal         domain continue to attenuate the distraction of the self into a reality         that propagates purple instead of green, absorbing the yellow (light)         vs. (just cause) red. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The danger         lies in sliding into the restorative, the self-referential, the <i>how-bu-how</i>         state of feeding pleasure vs. the flux of desire. How to ever ever how         this unappropriative, non-gender related female turbulence into appropriation         without dismissing enthalpy or replacing entropy with stark and often         barren pools of information, is a living hunger after the good and the         real, we, living, sustain. This losing proposition is where doubt stems         from, a reaction to the loss we as humans have incurred (an occurrence).         </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">No doubt         here, therefore. Ever to emanate the horizontal wisdom of a matriarchy         (not in contrast to but collaboration with the vertical or the patriarchal),         to apply the feminine as life's (fluid) currency through the pluralities         of voice and culture, working with what we have, modulating as we orient         the turbulent into a smooth space where it simultaneously emanates and         looks at itself doing so. This is where the magic of How2 lies--a magic         that is always reconfiguring, not unlike that of DNA, regrouping to differentiate.         </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As thought         relates to language after the fact--like Schroedinger's cat does (to Schroedinger)--let's         ab it (thought), as in ab-solve. Let us maintain this journal in the same         manner we maintain a PBS station, for a community's sake. No rules or         quotas here, only the ethical collective of oriental simultaneity and         occidental individualism, seeking the chaos sustaining the world of languages,         where one and its absence are forced to stay, where logocentric thought         is circumvented through derivatives of the past such that the new occurs.         There can be no prediction even under the maximum conditions of control.         Magic--that's something else. Let's help How2 maintain the magic of its         present stance--that of a possibility, a curatorial possibility--for poetry.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Arpine </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&lt;arpine@earthlink.net&gt;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">____________________</font>       </p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>June         12, 2000 </b></font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">from Marina         Morbiducci</font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">         </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>"Agenda:         hidden or manifest?"</b></font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I'm reacting         with interest to the "send me something drawen / on paper" piece by Aife         Murray (How2, n.3) where once again Emily Dickinson's poetic urgency emerges         and engages us powerfully, even if by way of "ephemera" or "pantry writing".</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While reading         the essay, it mingled with an issue I'm presently involved with, the one         of CENSURA &amp; CENSURE [Censorship and Censures], the focus of </font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">a         recent seminar at University of Pescara, Italy, June 6-7. Referring to         those original manuscripts "jotted on the backs of recipes, on used envelopes         and brown paper bags," Murray draws a parallel to the "hybrids"--I'm using         this critical term with a degree of reluctance--where Dickinson is mixing         "her writing with postage stamps, flowers, pine needles... illustrations         from her books and popular magazines". </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To me, more         than the result of "household technologies" or "ephemera," this "pantry         writing" is the unavoidable creative outcome of an existence like Dickinson's,         poetic to the core. The urge for poetry never stops nor drains in her         hands. Contrary to the avoidance of domestic work in favour of writing,         I envision an opposite sequence in the case of Dickinson: while she's         making poetry, she may also be doing the housework: that is the right         hierarchical succession of events in her kitchen. It is a matter of different         priorities, so that if the usual--canonically manifest and universally         accepted --agenda for a woman poet is to sneak away from housekeeping         to poetry writing, the hidden is exactly the opposite. Dickinson candidly         manipulates those "scraps" or "ephemera" as an indirect and concealed         form of self-censure, just to allow herself more time--the whole time--for         what she really lives for. Everybody knows what a jelly label is for:         the practice of poetry might eventually transform it into a manuscript.         But its manifest function remains that of sticking the name of the flavour         on a jar.

Each particle         being the consciousness of a particular moment--the poem--through a particular         consciousness-- the poet. All of us together a wave; confluence and momentum,         arcing toward...an aesthetic? intentional evolution? serendipitous perfection?         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The life         of the poet has always been important in determining the direction s/he         will take [responsibility for].

It is the disingenuousness of government         and corporate powers to define this massive colonization as cyberspace.         cyberspace n. the notional environment in which electronic communication         occurs.

I believe we are responsible for         directing some of those changes (the idea of conscious evolution--whose         consciousness?).

The image that sticks with me is of the 'proliferation         of perfect poems'. I too have noticed and enjoyed the abundance of accomplished         writing coming from women. Yet I'm a bit uneasy with the relation of that         perfection to daily life. Is there room for the unevenness of trying out         a new process, form, or imagery in one's writing. For example, I recall         David Buuck's powerful use, a few years ago, of stuttering in one of his         poems. What most compels/irritates me in my quotidian existence are the         struggles, rough edges, inconsistencies: i.e., it's exactly that it's         not perfect, though with life as with writing, there would be little engagement         if one didn't seek for a more satisfactory version. Can we therefore invite         the versions to proliferate and perhaps de-emphasize the perfections?         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Recently         a friend said to me, in reference to another writer, "She thinks of writing         as her job, and she takes it very seriously." My initial reaction was         one of admiration that this poet is so focussed and committed. It's truly         a good thing that there are people who have that to offer in their work         and as part of our writing community. At the same time, I feel there's         a subtle pressure on us as poets (and specifically as women poets) to         legitimize ourselves as writers by >evincing a singlemindedness that might         shut out other vital, if >fragmenting or distracting parts of our lives.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I unabashedly         want to be a good writer and want to have my work read. AND I agree with         Fanny that how we live our lives is important, though I hesitate to be         more specific than that. Poets such as Sara Menafee or Lisa Houston come         to mind as people who are perhaps not so widely read, but whose involvements         with community do bring a lively aroma of reality to their work. I guess         what I'm seeking is a critical consideration of how we live, respond,         move in and out of community and communities. As you said, it is important         to read and respond to the work of less appreciated writers. And can we         make our "reading" more inclusive still? I believe it would also be helpful         to embrace the inconsistencies, the tentative ventures, the struggles         that inform our lives broadly and in written form. Not that the perfect         poems previously mentioned are static by any means, but I suspect that         our interactions with them would be more engaging if we let them breathe         in a field that bears the blur and scuffmarks of daily struggle. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I hope that         doesn't sound too, I don't know, hrumphy.

After the New         Modernisms conference was over I went to Bethlehem (PA.) both to visit         H.D.'s grave and meet some scholars from Moravian seminary where I intend         to go back in order to learn more about Moravian rituals and religious         philosophy and work on the connections between H.D.'s poetry and Moravianism.         When I talked to people about the reason for my visit to Bethlehem, I         saw that most of them hadn't even heard HD's name. I think we must work         much harder in order to make people more aware of her and other poets'         work. I believe that poetry is self-making and what people of our age         need is a new self. Jung declares : ' A work of art is produced that may         be called a message to a generation of men.' We are carriers of the message         and must attempt to increase the number of hearers by creating a new medium         (a new language) to reach people who can form a new self by reading poems,         thereby discovering their common heritage and opening the doors of their         own haunted houses. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So the question         of language is a very important issue and I would like to see people discuss         it. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Nesrin Eruysal         <br>        Middle East Technical University </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">____________________</font></p>      <p><b>12/2/99</b></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>"Does         it matter?"</b></font></p>      <p><b><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">[excerpts         from letter exchange between Fanny Howe &amp; Kathleen Fraser ]</font></b><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>        </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I just feel         that generally there is something about poetry now that is bigger than         any particular person--women poets especially.

And I think people get really upset by         being left out, or misunderstood, because of this fundamental unknowingness.         Maybe we will all be understood only en masse, and not as individuals,         as in the past. . . . And maybe life itself will rear its ugly head in         the end, and how each of us lived will actually be important, not just         how we wrote, and there will be some sudden heroic poets who laid down         their life for it, and for life itself, who will explain its meaning--to         those who come after. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">FH<br>        </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">12/12/99</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 've continued         to be haunted by your description of all of us standing in the field,         waiting for some noonlight to find us, some recognition by the non-existent         judge/s.

For this reason, How2 encourages/         incites active resistance to the depressing and self-limiting conclusion         that there is only ONE useful (official? rational? authoritative? properly         trained?) way to think and write about work being produced--in this case,         by women writing outside the establishment mainstream. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">KF<br>        </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">12/13/99</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The issue         that at present really presses on me is that of the proliferation of perfect         poems coming out of everywhere.

Now I am not even sure exactly what I am after, but I know         I am amazed by the wonderful poems women (in particular) are writing,         and feel the intelligence as an act of freedom in itself. </font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But I also         wonder what happened to the stench of reality that used to cling to certain         works/words.
