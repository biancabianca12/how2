 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Revisiting Nicole Brossard: Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois Feminist Subjectivity in the 21 st Century </strong></p>
 <p>In her metafictive autobiographical essay, <em>She Would Be the First Sentence of My Next Novel, </em>Nicole Brossard establishes the temporal parameters of the “ <em>&eacute;criture au f&eacute;minin </em>” movement in Quebec as 1975-1982. As Peggy Kelly notes, Brossard added the “au” to the French term <em>l'&eacute;criture f&eacute;minine </em> with the effect of stressing agency in “a conscious assertion of feminine subjectivity.” Correspondingly, in her work from this period, Brossard emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously inserting Woman into the symbolic order and women into urban space. It is no accident that Brossard dates the end of the movement in the year that saw the publication of her book <em>Picture Theory, </em>which Alice Parker has called “a tour de force that could have no sequel.” Despite the apparent demise of the movement, the work of Brossard 's <em>&eacute;criture au f&eacute;minin </em>period continues to provoke compelling critical debate. Submissions on the following questions are invited for a special feature in the online journal How2 ( <a href="http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2/index.htm">http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/ stadler&shy; center/how2/index.htm </a>): </p>
 <p>Does the ontological project of inserting Woman into the symbolic order succeed or fail? Does the universalism of the construct “Woman” result in insensitivity to differences of race and class, and if so, can it be redeemeed? Does subversion of literary conventions constitute efficacious feminist praxis? Why have Brossard 's later prose works become more representational? What new and productive constellations can be discerned in her work among concepts such as: space, city, utopia, subjectivity, discourse, lesbian desire, representation and innovation? And, finally, does the contemporary generation of Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois women writers extend, ignore, or fail to understand this earlier literary movement? These guidelines offer suggestions only; contributors should feel welcome to submit groundbreaking work on Brossard that explores alternative questions.</p>
 <p>Submissions of 2500-5000 words should be sent electronically as RTF documents to the feature's co-editors by <strong>May 2004 </strong>: Dr. Jodi Lundgren ( <a href="mailto:jlundgren@cariboo.bc.ca">jlundgren@cariboo.bc.ca </a>) and Dr. Kelly-Anne Maddox ( <a href="mailto:kmaddox@cariboo.bc.ca">kmaddox@cariboo.bc.ca </a>).</p>
 <p>Papers must be written in English. Quotations must be translated into English. When possible, the official translations are preferable. Submissions should be double-spaced in Times New Roman 12 point font. Surname and page number should appear in the top right hand corner of each page. Parenthetical citations and Works Cited should follow the MLA format, with footnotes kept to a minimum. Please include name, institutional affiliation and a brief biographical note on a separate sheet. </p>

      <p>It might seem paradoxical to consider the century of the Modernist avant-garde from the point of view of nostalgia. However, nostalgia manifests itself in twentieth-century British poetry in a multitude of ways. A selection of papers (in English) will be published in ETUDES BRITANNIQUES CONTEMPORAINES after the conference. </p>
      <p>Proposals in English (200 words for a 25 minute paper) to be sent to Professor Paul Volsik (at:- <a href="mailto:volsik@paris7.jussieu.fr">volsik@paris7.jussieu.fr</a>) before the end of MARCH 2003. Decision on acceptance by the scientific committee (SEAC) before Easter 2003. </p>
