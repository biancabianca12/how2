  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This paper traces my engagement with the writings of women mystics in mediaeval Europe, which resulted in a series of poems.  I want to stress that this is not an explanation or justification of
  the poetry, and also that I am by no means an expert in mediaeval writing.  It was written simultaneously with the poetry, perhaps in sympathy with Jack Spicer’s admonition: “We will use up our rhetoric here so that it will not appear in the poems.  Let it be consumed, paragraph by paragraph, day by day, until nothing of it is left in our poetry and nothing of our poetry is left in
  it.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>  So the relationship between
  what I say here and what the poetry turned out to be, apart from their common
  points of departure, is uncertain; they are perhaps entirely parallel
  investigations driven by the same interest.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I’ve called it <i>Specula</i>,
  mirrors, a common mediaeval trope for the book, because I found reading these
  mystic writings generated all sorts of reflections on my own and other
  contemporary writings.  My dialogue with the texts has been primarily as a
  poet: this means an opportunistic, argumentative, cannibalistic and
  disrespectful relationship, organised only by unpredictable structures of
  responsiveness and preserving jealously a certain irresponsibility which is
  totally at odds with scholarly study. Despite this, my interest led me to some
  cogitations which may masquerade as scholarly: and that’s as far as my apologia
  for this essay goes.  Here I aim to explore why these writings attract me, to
  briefly sketch their context and nature, and also to reflect briefly on a
  couple of aspects of contemporary poetics which this essay into the Middle Ages
  have highlighted for me.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To read mediaeval texts in
  Europe, where everywhere are old stones bearing the mark of human habitation
  stretching back thousands of years, is one experience: there one is aware of
  the gap of time, but also of concrete continuities.  To read them in Australia,
  where European history goes back only slightly more than 200 years, and where
  most of the buildings that surround you are much less than a century old, is
  another.  It makes reading a uniquely linguistic experience: the writing is
  unsupported by the architectures of inhabited landscape, the landscape which
  has been shaped by European language and which has shaped it.  I look out my
  window, I walk through the suburbs, and nothing in my environment supports
  these historical experiences: I see no ruins, no churches below the level of
  the contemporary street, no sense of “old stones” beneath the bright commercial
  surfaces.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like its landscape, Australian
  history is vast, stretching back 140 millennia, and becomes mythological: myth
  being the stories we inscribe across the blankness of geographical time.  This
  span of time yawns behind our tiny European history, just as the inner deserts
  dwarf our urban habitation.  It’s not unlike how the shadows in an enormous
  theatre in which only tiny patches of human activity are lit can create an
  enormous poignancy, a physical sense of the mortality and insignificance of
  human beings.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A few years ago I paid a brief
  visit to Lake Mungo, which is near where the borders of Victoria, South
  Australia and NSW meet.  Here it is red earth Australia, an entirely different
  landscape to the somewhat Europeanised one I’m used to in Victoria: the
  vegetation is aqua, a result I think of the salt content of the soil, and the
  leaves have different, strangely primitive shapes.  Lake Mungo itself is
  strictly speaking a plain: it was an actual lake 30,000 years ago.  What is
  left is miles of level red earth, sprinkled with the low blue fuzz of saltbush
  and bounded by high white sand dunes which once marked the shores.  There is a
  constant, punishing wind which bruises your skin and continually shuffles the
  dunes.  Lake Mungo has now turned into a tourist attraction; there are the
  outbuildings of a now deserted sheep property, and a small modern museum which
  houses some of the fossils of now extinct species which have been found there,
  like the giant marsupial wombat, and Aboriginal relics.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What struck me with particular
  piquancy were the 30,000 year old camp sites which have left their traces in
  the sand dunes.  Buried in the sands are the remains of ancient meals: shells
  from molluscs which were gathered from the vanished lake, bones of cooked animals,
  the blackened earth of a fire extinguished millennia ago.  The wind, in its
  constant movement of the dunes, continually brings these traces to the surface:
  usually all too briefly, since such exposure signals the beginning of their
  ultimate obliteration.  You can stand over these ghostly campfires and watch
  the process of the wind eroding them, the sand blasting away at the shells and
  bones and blackened earth, until no sign at all remains.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lake Mungo is one of those
  places where European language falters.  You can describe the sense of
  horizonless space and time beyond a human scale, the overpowering feeling of
  human insignificance, mortality and poignant persistence, but really you are
  left with a palpable sense of the inadequacy of words.  It throws up a
  challenge to the limits of language, and so suggests the edges of mysticism. 
  In Aboriginal languages and systems of meaning, this is a landscape of
  presence, harsh perhaps, but speaking of vitality and life, impregnated with
  myths of creation which are ongoing, a primordial time which exists within, not
  before, the present.  But a European mentality ends up describing everything in
  terms of absence and negativity: to a European eye, this landscape has an
  indescribably desolate beauty, the kind of godlessness which to some minds
  invites an image of God, a drastic alienness which shocks the self out of its
  comfortable linguistic associations.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This sense of dislocation
  extends to my relationship to the English language, as I am a first generation
  migrant from England.  That dislocating shock of alienated language is part of
  my primary experience and has had a profound affect on how I write poetry. 
  Perhaps this partly explains my attraction to the mystical texts.  I discovered
  a surprising contemporaneity in these 700 year old writings, in their
  displacements of self and contradictorily empowering strategies of speaking, in
  their assertion of interiority as a public act.  Without projecting an
  imaginary feminism onto them, it seems to me that the writings of mystic women
  can be seen as visualisations of possibility rather than, as has been often
  said, simply expressions of “hysteria” or sexual lack, or the self indulgent
  expressions of the frustrated egos of women.  The fantasies of the female
  mystics could go so far as to reshape an obdurate reality to more rightly fit
  their desires, however temporarily, and functioned as expressions of freedom in
  a world in which women’s voices were “stifled, imprisoned by an ethic that
  treated sins of the tongue as gluttony and as harbingers of worse, of lust and
  pride.”  In such a society, “women who presumed to speak out publicly only
  compounded the sin” of speaking at all.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> 
  They remain potent traces of a successful struggle by the silenced against
  silence.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Historically, Western woman
  has been, by definition, not a literary being, a maker of original texts: at
  best she was a helpmeet to male fertility; at worst, she simply didn’t exist. 
  To confidently assert the right to speak against this historical weight can be
  mentally taxing, even now; in the Middle Ages, when the legal rights of women
  were minimal, and their right to speak in public barely extant, it is
  surprising they managed to speak in this way at all.  Yet there are dozens of
  texts in which women articulate their desire to speak, from educated
  aristocratic women like Christine de Pisan to the often anonymous hagiographies
  of Beguine nuns and the estimated one per cent of female troubadours.  The
  creative ways in which women have attacked and subverted the prescription of
  silence are manifold and have been traced in many ways by many people, and it’s
  not my intention, nor within my ability, to do more than look at a very small
  part of what is an enormous subject.  Specifically, I want to look at the
  energising freedom to be found in the extremities of the female mystics, a
  throwing off of linguistic constraints in the midst of the very act of bowing
  to conventions.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here I simply intend to make a
  couple of very sketchy general observations of the institutionalised cultural
  misogyny in the West, and its venerable history.  In Christian society, the
  myth of Eve is a dominant symbol in the representation of women and their
  relation to language.  Eve, Dante said in <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>, was the
  institutor of language; she was, after Satan, the first to use language to
  seduce and mislead, and her tongue was the originator of her sin and of
  humankind’s misfortunes.  In Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Eve addresses the
  fruit of the Tree of Knowledge as the “best of Fruits”, “whose taste… at first
  assay / Gave elocution to the mute, and taught / The Tongue not made for Speech
  to speak thy praise”.  Significantly, in Milton’s version the most tempting
  quality of the fruit is rationality: Eve sees that the Serpent “knows, and speaks,
  and reasons, and discernes” and, desiring this “intellectual food”, she eats
  the apple, greedily gorging “without restraint”.  A woman’s intellectual
  curiosity, inseparable from sensual abandon, precipitates the Fall of Mankind,
  instates the central myth of nostalgia in Western symbology, and is a synonym
  for disaster.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A major expression of this
  myth has been the traditional prescription of silence for women, a silence
  posited in relation to women’s reputed loquacity.  It is important to remember
  that the language and rationality of men has never held the same dangers as
  that of women, although of course heretics of both sexes (both within and
  outside the church) have always been persecuted and murdered.  Heretic men
  chose to speak outside a public arena already prescribed for them; women had no
  such arena.  In Mediaeval France women were not even allowed to testify in
  court; the only case in which their word was considered reliable was if they
  had to attest (a word in itself derived from male sexual organs!) which of
  twins arrived first.  “Teach women neither reading nor writing,” said the
  theologian Philippe of Novarre.  He was more extreme than many, but
  nevertheless the untrustworthiness and triviality of women’s tongues is a
  byword: we still, for example, speak of trivial timewasters of either sex as
  “old women”. </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The Romantics’ spin on
  traditional misogynistic ideologies was their appropriation of feminine
  qualities, metamorphosed into the ability to give birth and nurture, into the
  male body of a Genius.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> 
  The Romantic relationship of Genius to the patriarchal God is clear in Thomas
  Carlyle’s description of the Man of Genius: </p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The most precious gift that
      Heaven can give to the Earth: a man of ‘genius’ as we call it; the Soul of a
      man actually sent down from the skies, with a God’s-message to us ... A
      messenger he, sent from the Infinite Unknown ... We may call him Poet, Prophet,
      God ...” <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> 
      </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Male Genius, however,
  appropriated into itself the feminine qualities of sensitivity and nurturance,
  even morbidity and hysteria; great artists “gave birth” to their work,
  gestating them behind their magnificent foreheads.  Women’s bodies were too
  fragile to sustain the fiery daemon of Genius without causing harm to
  themselves; talented women, like Elizabeth Barrett Browning, were condemned to
  illness and early death.  If by some freak of nature they survived their Genius
  they were held to be, like George Sand, deviant men.  Women’s creative impulses
  were totally fulfilled in childbirth and any woman seeking fulfilment in art
  was a freak of nature, a perversion.  It is not, alas, an idea which has
  vanished.  As recently as 1989, George Steiner was able to ask seriously:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Is there in the almost total
      absence from drama of any major woman writer some formidable hint?  Is the
      biological capacity for procreation, for engendering formed life which is
      cardinal to woman, in some way, at some level, absolutely primordial to a
      woman’s being, so creative, so fulfilling, as to subvert, as to render
      comparatively pallid, the begetting of fictive personae which is the matter of
      drama and of so much representative art? <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"
  title="">[5]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Aside from Steiner’s apparent total
  ignorance of the fact that theatre is the most social of all the arts, and that
  this might have implications for women’s participation in it, he rather
  traditionally couches male genius as an envy of female procreation (and the
  creativity of a patriarchal God), and metaphorically assimilates the act of
  “birth” to the male.  This infusion of female potencies into the male corpus
  was an idea carried forward enthusiastically into modernism through such
  writers as Nietzsche, although, as we shall see, it is an ancient trope.  A
  typical C20<sup>th</sup> explication of male and female creativity is Jung’s
  analysis, in which he permits a woman the role of helpmeet, and reserves
  originatory creativity for men:  </p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Just as man brings forth his
      work as a complete creation out of his inner feminine nature, so the inner
      masculine side of a women brings forth creative seeds which have the power to
      fertilise the feminine side of the man.  <a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"
  title="">[6]</a> 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The confusion of the ideas of
  female and feminine and the almost non-existent interrogation of notions of
  masculinity in relation to men make this a particularly confused area in post
  modern thinking, where femininity has sometimes been valorised despite an
  almost total exclusion of the female in a depressingly familiar way.  This
  appropriation works through a mask of neutrality, an apparent genderlessness
  which permits the male to stand as the signifier for all humankind and to deny
  his maleness, putting the burden of sex wholly on women, who are defined
  continuously by their sexual status.  I’d like to orient my discussion by
  quoting from Maria Black and Rosalind Coward’s 1981 essay, <u>Linguistic,
  social and sexual relations</u>:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>We do not see the problem [of
      sexism in language] as one of the suppression of female meanings, nor do we see
      the solution as simply validating everything produced by women, as the
      expression of pre-existent feminine values.  We see one of the major political
      problems confronting feminism to be the need to force men to recognise
      themselves as <i>men</i>.  The discursive formation which allows men to
      represent themselves as non-gendered and to define women constantly according
      to their sexual status is a discursive formation with very definite effects. 
      It allows men to deny the effect of their gendered subjectivity on women.  ...
      What is available to them is a discourse where gender and sexual identity
      appears to be absent.... Men are sustained at the centre of the stage precisely
      because they can be ‘people’ and do not have to represent their masculinity to
      themselves. <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The mystic texts captured my
  attention initially because of their often amazing sensuality and eroticism. 
  But they are also interesting because they are instrumental in inaugurating a
  new Western vocabulary for inner consciousness which has been influential to
  this day.  Historian Danielle Régnier-Bohler points out that lexical studies
  have shown that Meister Eckhardt and Ruusbrook would not have written as they
  did had it not been for the women who preceded them.<a href="#_edn8"
  name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a>  These influences can be traced
  in later writings, such as those, for example, of St John of the Cross in the
  erotic mysticism of the <i>Dark Night of the Soul</i>, the more famous descendants
  eclipsing their forerunners in much the same way as Elvis Presley appropriated
  and obscured the music of black musicians.  “They invented a novel diction,”
  says Régnier-Bohler of the Beguine nuns: “a comprehensive language that made
  room for the body in the spiritual vocabulary”.  This has clear resonances with
  contemporary ideas about writing the body: but there are important
  differences.  One is the emphasis placed on rationality in many of the
  Mediaeval texts, and another is the mystic erasure or elision of self, which
  can be seen, rather than an abnegation of power, as an appropriation of the
  male right to be sexless and ungendered: the right to represent humankind.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is commonplace to attribute
  the sometimes extreme mysticism of the women of that time to hysteria, the
  madness traditionally supposed to be caused by vapours rising from the womb
  which cloud and destroy judgement.  Julia Kristeva’s take on mystical elements
  in literature is not, I think, inaccurate, but it is incomplete: “...literature
  is probably a version of the apocalypse that seems to me rooted, no matter what
  its sociolo-historical conditions might be, on the fragile border (borderline
  cases) where identities (subject/object, etc.) do not exist or only barely so —
  double, fuzzy, heterogenous, animal, metamorphosed, altered, abject.”  <a
  href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a>  However, Kristeva’s analysis
  of abjection and its relation to the excluded maternal/female “filth”, which is
  at once violently rejected and sacralised, takes the male subject as its
  normative centre.  The female, or the feminised Jew, is the “Other”, dealt with
  only in its distorted relationship to a normative male subjectivity.  This
  refuses the possibility of another subject, a female subject which asserts
  itself as its own centre.  (I use male and female advisedly here, since I do
  not wish to enter into discussions of masculine and feminine as free floating
  values, as they seem to adhere stubbornly to a male norm.)  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is this re-placed subject
  which interests me, because I see its possibility shining fitfully through
  these texts, obscure and difficult and ambiguous as they are.  It is precisely
  in these ambivalences and violations of social norms that I believe this
  subject situates itself very carefully in relation to the prevailing orthodoxies.
  Adducing these strategies as a kind of sexual hysteria elides and trivialises
  their possibilities, by focussing on the pre-linguistic feminine at the expense
  of the desire towards the forbidden fruit of intellectual rationality.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In discussing the rash of
  prophetic outbursts which occurred during the Interregnum after the English
  Civil War, the historian Keith Thomas notes that women were denied access to
  any public expression in church, state or university.  He says, a little
  myopically, that women who attempted to break into these male preserves were
  “very liable to develop a bizarre exterior”.  “Indeed, the prominence of women
  among the religious prophets of this period is partly explained by the fact
  that the best hope of gaining an ear for female utterances was to represent
  them as the result of divine revelation”.  And he adds, though this time not in
  relation to female prophecies:  “The claim to divine inspiration was an
  accompaniment to radical politics... the overwhelming majority of those who
  claimed divine authority for their utterances were seeking authority for a
  religious or social program”.  <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a></p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Without suggesting that these
  women had any sense of modern feminist consciousness, it seems a fair
  supposition that female prophets were asserting their right to be articulate
  and public human beings, able to comment on and perhaps influence public life,
  and using what resources were then available to them: in this case, that of
  divine revelation.  I think this strategy is particularly clear earlier in <i>The
  Book of Margery of Kempe</i>.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the Middle Ages, despite
  the prevailing misogynies, gender and sex were fluid concepts: </p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Medieval medical views of sex,
      inherited from Aristotle and Galen, suggested that one’s sex category was
      located along a continuum; the distinction between males and females was
      essentially that the genitals of the males were outside and the (identical)
      genitals of the female were enclosed...; hermaphrodites were that rare instance
      of a place in the middle of the continuum (emblematic of the Adamic state).
      Moreover, the Patristic assertion, attributable as far back as Jerome and
      repeated in the Middle Ages, was that a woman could in some way become a man by
      vowing chastity and living an ascetic life. This commonplace of spirituality
      itself would suggest that gender was viewed in the Middle Ages at least as much
      as a performance, a construction, as it was viewed as a biological given, an
      essential or ontological state of being. The history of medieval transvestism
      would also seem indicative of such a performative notion of gender.... Bynum
      concludes that medieval theory acknowledged the “permeability or
      interchangeability of the sexes,” although “the male body is paradigmatic” <a
  href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This suggests a window of
  possibility which was fully exploited by the Beguines and other women who
  wanted to adopt the “male” role of speaking in public or obtaining spiritual
  authority.  Educated humanists such as Christine de Pisan could battle for the
  right to speak in the narrow arena of letters and had no hesitation in picking
  up the battle to defend her sex, especially in her famous arguments against the
  <i>Roman de la Rose</i> and in her epic poem <i>The City of Women</i>.  But in
  order to do so, de Pisan first transformed herself into a man, “unsexing”
  herself, like Lady Macbeth, in order to be a literary male: <i>Insignis Femina,
  Virilis Femina</i>.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The mystics were in many cases
  doing something even more subversive.  They developed what Danielle
  Régnier-Bohler calls an “emotional dialect, well adapted to vigorous self
  expression, to spontaneity and immediacy.  They “aspired to speak not the
  language of men, but a language that was at once less and more”.<a
  href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>  They demanded that language
  express the inexpressible and in so doing stretched its boundaries to include
  their own experiences and desires.  In theatricalising the self, as did Margery
  of Kempe, or erasing it, as in the immolatory love theologies of women such as
  Beatrice of Nazareth, they challenged the central supremacy of the male subject
  and placed their own desires and passions centre stage.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Considerations of these texts
  must also take into account the politics of the vulgate: of which, more later. 
  And it is important to remember that they were heavily mediated and reviewed by
  Church authorities.  Many mystics were illiterate, and had to rely on male
  scribes to relate their experiences, some of whom ingeniously sought to
  “improve their style”.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> 
  Their decision to write down their experiences so others could read them always
  followed mediation with a confessor, which confuses the provenance and
  transparency of the texts still further.  Almost all the writings begin with
  protestations of the woman’s unworthiness to speak: quite often, this melds
  with a surprising confidence in the woman’s divine vocation for revelation.  A
  typical example is this passage from Hildegard of Bingen’s <i>Scivias</i>:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>And I, a human being, neither
      ablaze with the strength of strong lions nor learned in their exhalations,
      remaining in the fragility of the weaker rib, but filled with mystical inspiration,
        <i>saw</i>:  [emphasis mine]<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">where Bingen’s confession of innate
  female weakness and her lack of scholarly credentials serves rather to
  intensify the force of her mystical inspiration, and the authority of her
  vision.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Underneath the tropes of apology
  and humility, the unworthiness, the necessary abjection of a woman daring to
  speak at all, one reads again and again the making of a new space, a gap, which
  constitutes an assault on the language of the times.  Usually unlettered in
  Latin, and without the intellectual tools of educated men, they wrote in the
  vulgate: Dutch, French, German, English.  Into the semantics of written
  language, and drawing on the established traditions of “love mysticism” and
  courtly poetry, they introduced a powerful and vivid metaphoric vocabulary of
  sensual perception.  Marguerite d’Oingt describes a vision of a tree with five
  branches, on which were written the names of the five senses; the texts again
  and again resort to erotic imagery to describe the ecstasy of union with the
  Godhead.  Spiritual states are described in terms of hunger, intoxication, and
  physical passion, and in terms which made of the body a theatre of violence:
  Beatrice of Nazareth, for example, speaks of love which “wants and devours all
  things” which causes “the heart to beat so fast and furious that it feels
  wounded through and through ... The veins seem to open, the blood to run out,
  the marrow to wither.  Bones crack, the chest explodes, the throat is
  parched...”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a>   
  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For these mediaeval women, the
  articulation of emotional and spiritual lives was the reverse of private: it
  was their means of un-privatising themselves, of moving out of a domestic or
  cloistered sphere in which they were habitually confined into a public space
  inhabited almost exclusively by men.  This had practical force: as a result of
  her writings, Hildegard of Bingen embarked on a lecture tour of Europe when she
  was sixty, and corresponded with the important European leaders of her time,
  and Margery of Kempe made herself both adored and reviled, and most certainly
  noticed, by her behaviours.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">However, the subversiveness of
  these writers does not exist simply in the assertion of feminine values against
  a phallic logocentric dominance.  This assumption has led to some misleading conclusions:
  for example, in this statement, which suggests a mediaeval “proto-feminism” in
  Julian of Norwich’s visions of a feminised Christ who gives suck and endures
  pregnancy:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The ‘mother-text’ does not
      manifest itself merely by the production of maternal imagery, but maternality
      and the text seem to become inextricably interwoven.  Further, I wish to
      illustrate that femininity and femaleness fuse with matrifocality — ‘the voice
      mixed with milk’ — forming a counterdiscourse which disturbs the patriarchal
      discourse of Christian theology.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This ignores the established
  Christian-Judaeic tradition, prevalent in Mediaeval times, of the appropriation
  of feminine imagery of fertility into a male figure.  Dr Thomas E. Long traces
  this image from Beothius’ <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>, in which Philosophy
  gives suck to the feminine soul, and also as a long recognised trope of
  Jesus-as-Mother deriving from Anselm.  He points out that the three stereotypes
  of motherhood used in this tradition — pregnant and sacrificial, loving and
  tender, and nurturing — are also tropes used most often by male writers in
  describing <i>themselves</i>. <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> 
  Which is to say that Julian’s vision of a maternal Christ disturbed no patriarchal
  discourse but rather, existed comfortably within it.  As I noted earlier, the
  potent feminised male is also a trope of Romantic genius and, as Luce Irigaray
  comments, a characteristic of Jacques Lacan, who reserved to himself — and not
  to women — the authority to speak of female pleasure.<a href="#_edn18"
  name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a></p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A simplistic view of feminine
  assertion trivialises the ingenuity of the tactics used by writers such as
  Julian of Norwich or Margery of Kempe, who worked creatively within the limits
  of contemporary orthodoxies, appropriating their authorities to validate their
  own experiences and their right to speak.  In order to escape accusations of
  heresy they had to work within recognisable conventions, on pain, literally, of
  death, while pursuing an agenda which, even within its limits, was radical
  enough: to speak publicly as women.  On more subtle levels, it’s possible to
  find ingenious inversions of gender stereotypes.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A suggestive example is Julian
  of Norwich’s insistent coupling of moisture with life, and dryness with
  death.   Mediaeval Aristotelian and Galenic definitions based the innate
  inferiority of women on their moistness and coldness.  Heat and dryness were
  male virtues, signifying wit and <i>ingenium</i>, but females were, as Galen
  said, “imperfect, and it were, <i>mutilated</i>” due to their coldness and
  wetness; assumptions which underlie later Romantic ideas of fiery male Genius.<a
  href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a>  In the light of this
  assumption, it’s interesting to read Julian’s vision of Christ dying:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>I saw His sweet face as it
      were dry and bloodless with pale dying. ... </p>
    <p>This was a pitiful change to
    see, this deep dying. And also the [inward] moisture clotted and dried, to my
    sight, and the sweet body was brown and black, all turned out of fair,
    life-like colour of itself, unto dry dying. </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:28.0pt;margin-bottom:
  0in;margin-left:28.35pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>Bloodlessness and pain dried
  within; and blowing of wind and cold coming from without met together in the
  sweet body of Christ. And these four, -- twain without, and twain within --
  dried the flesh of Christ by process of time. And though this pain was bitter
  and sharp, it was full long lasting, as to my sight, and painfully dried up all
  the lively spirits of Christ’s flesh. Thus I saw the sweet flesh dry in seeming
  by part after part, with marvellous pains. ...</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>And methought the drying of
      Christ’s flesh was the most pain, and the last, of His Passion. </p>
    <p>For this word was shewed for
    the bodily thirst: the which I understood was caused by failing of moisture. <a
  href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Throughout these passages, again and
  again, the word “dry” occurs as a motif of deathliness, while moisture
  signifies life.  Later Julian associates fluidity with prayer and godliness. 
  This qualitative shifting of activity and life to moisture and passivity and
  death to “drying” inverts a dominant metaphor about femininity and femaleness. 
  But, as Dr Thomas E. Long warns, it is notoriously difficult to untangle Julian
  of Norwich’s discourse from the surrounding traditions to find a “feminist”
  consciousness.  What counts is her assertion of her authority to speak at all:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>What is irreducible... in
      Julian of Norwich’s <i>Shewings</i> are the traces of [an] authorized voice,
      insistent upon its authenticity against the canons of the male-dominated
      religious establishment, the besouled body from her cell empowering other more
      public women like the vexed and vexing Margery Kempe. <a href="#_edn21"
  name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perhaps the most significant
  elision imposed by simply seeking a feminine imaginary in the texts is the
  common assertion by mediaeval women of their right to the “intellectual fruit”
  of rationality.  In her 12C adaptation of the Latin text of the life of
  Catherine of Alexandria, <i>Vie de sainte Catherine</i>, <a href="#_edn22"
  name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> written in Anglo-Norman
  octosyllabic couplets, Clemence of Barking was described an intelligent and
  eloquent woman whom “no dialectician on earth could defeat”.  When Catherine
  took the Emperor to task, to “prove to him by logic” that his law was wrong, he
  called on rhetoricians to “confound her so that she can make no further reply
  and has to surrender publicly” and “maintain his honour and his law” against
  this “powerful woman”.  She not only defeated the rhetoriticians, but converted
  them to her point of view.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Elizabeth K. Schirmer, in her
  essay <u>Orthodoxy, Textuality, and the “Tretys” of Margery Kempe,</u> looks in
  detail at Kempe’s strategies of appropriation and subversion of the Church’s
  textual authorities.  “By 1413,” writes Schirmer, “any layperson who claimed that
  his or her spiritual welfare was independent from the institutional structures
  of the church, or whose theology seemed independent of its teachings, could be
  tried for heresy and persecuted for treason”.  The church sought to protect its
  authority by strictly controlling lay vernacular spiritual texts.  Bishop
  Arundel was the architect of the Lambeth Constitutions, which sought “to bring
  the spread of reading and writing among laypeople firmly under the control of
  Arundel and his church, thus preserving the clear distinctions between cleric
  and lay, <i>literatus</i> and <i>illiteratus</i>, upon which rested so much of
  that institution’s spiritual and temporal authority.”</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>In doing so, he sought to
      establish and enforce an implicit dichotomy between two ways of reading the
      Bible as text: the laity were to read the Bible as a structure of narratives,
      narratives that do their work in the realm of the devotional imagination; the
      clergy were to read it as a structure of words, words that provided them with
      the basis for developing and defending orthodox theology and doctrine. It was,
      to risk a simplification, an attempt to enforce a strict division between
      propositional logic and emotional response, intellect and affect. <a
  href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this context, Kempe’s
  bounteous weeping and assertion of a direct relationship with God were clearly
  dubious, and she was in fact accused of lollardism, the heresy deriving from
  John Wyclif which demanded vulgate translations of religious texts so lay
  people could develop their own unmediated experience with God, directly
  threatening clerical authority.  In one episode in her book, Kempe is brought
  to task by Bishop Arundel himself.  The result is that Kempe, like Catherine of
  Alexandria, converts the Bishop, who commends her “manner of living” and proclaims
  her to be “hyly inspyred wyth the Holy Gost”.</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Again and again, she defends
      her orthodoxy in ways that work against the very heart of Arundel’s project:
      attacked for living a life deemed inappropriate for a married woman (her
      detractors often mention her wearing white and travelling alone, and at least
      one fears she will persuade other women to follow in her footsteps), and
      accused by clerics of heresy due to her “preaching” and her knowledge of the
      scriptures, she successfully defends herself by citing the scriptures, once
      even in Latin, in the course of remarkably theological-sounding debates. And
      just as Kempe proves her orthodoxy by appropriating a discourse (theological
      debate) that could prove her heresy, so she uses her ... meditations to legitimate
      exactly the behavior that calls her orthodoxy into question in the first place:
  “preaching,” travelling alone, living chaste as a wife, and so forth. <a
  href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Schirmer argues, like Lynn
  Staley, that Kempe is properly “author” of her text, whether or not she in fact
  wrote it (it is possible that she wrote it herself, using the intervention of a
  priest merely as a necessary distancing trope but, like most of the book’s
  claims, it is impossible to verify either way.) Arguing that many of Kempe’s
  stories are fictional, Staley claims that the Book is a carefully composed text
  that makes use of strategies such as appropriation and manipulation of generic
  conventions to the deployment of deliberate ambiguities, familiar from post
  modern literature. <a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a>
  Such techniques recall the literary strategies of Merrano Jews in Inquisition
  Spain, the tradition which inflected Spinoza’s texts, and which permitted him,
  for example, to propose ideas such as the historical reading of the Bible in a
  context of Judaeic orthodoxy in Holland.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Schirmer argues further that, through her
  Book, Kempe gives textual status to her life:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The text is not unlike Kempe’s tears, in
      that both authenticate her experiences and make them public, linking her
      interior and exterior, her spiritual and worldly lives and serving as a
      publicly visible conduit between them. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Kempe was not alone among the
  mystics in introducing a new range of language to the written word: the
  language of sobs, cries, sleep, tears, screams, the “interstices of language”,
  which shifted written language beyond mere words.   Margery of Kempe’s
  excessive tears and screams drew priestly disopprobrium, a sign she converted
  into further proof of her holiness and used as an occasion to voice severe
  criticisms of the church.  It was <i>women</i> who understood Kempe’s extreme
  behaviour, which perhaps expressed what they wanted to say themselves, and they
  “only loved her the more”<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a>. 
  This wordless emotional identification and its reactive expression against
  gendered silencing is not confined to mediaeval women; for example, Andrea
  Brady notes, in her essay <u>100 Days, Poetic Pathos and Political Apathy</u>:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>In Cretan funerals in the
      early 20th century... the lament of the widow was instrumental rather than
      resigned: her complaint caused others to identify with her suffering, and thus
      subverted the misogynist authority which consigned her to poverty and
      diminished status.  Widows linked their own personal experience to collective
      representations of grief in order to sadden their audience; for them, the lament
      stalled the social invisibility which creeps over an isolated (unmarried)
      woman. <a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Through its expression,
  emotional identification becomes an instrument of belief and action.  When
  Kempe was dictating her biography, it moved the priest to tears himself, so
  much so that his vestments were drenched in them, and converting him to the
  deep empathy required to write her story.  And this investment of the body with
  spiritual authority extends into eroticism.  Sometimes the language can take a
  modern reader aback: one of the high points of Margery of Kempe’s Book is a
  conversation with Christ in which he tells her, using the intimate “thy”, that
  “you may boldly when you are in your bed take me to you as thy wedded husband
  and your dearworthy darling and you may boldly kiss my mouth”.   This invests
  the metaphor of “Bride of Christ” with an intriguing literalism, and when taken
  in tandem with Kempe’s struggle to attain chasteness and the somewhat comical
  bargain she finally strikes with her husband (she agrees to pay his debts in
  exchange for relinquishing his rights as a husband) begins to suggest a
  fascinating possibility of female satisfaction, rather than abnegation, in the
  idea of chasteness.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is clear throughout her
  Book that Kempe’s erotic attraction to men does not disappear with her
  enlightenment, but it begins to take another form: when she sees handsome men
  in Rome, for example, she is overborne with emotion because of their similarity
  to Christ.  The focus of her desire is her relationship with Jesus, an ideal
  lover who is “always pleased” with her, and in whom she finds bliss
  unattainable elsewhere.  (Perhaps it is important to remember at this point
  that Kempe had already had thirteen children when she began her mystic
  visions).  By asserting her orthodoxy and the direct nature of her divine
  inspiration, Kempe clears a space in which her own desires take centre stage.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Georges Bataille’s history of
  eroticism in the Christian church is somewhat eccentric, since it ignores the
  rich history of sacred erotic writing through the Middle Ages and the
  Renaissance and its expression, for example, in the work of Bernard de
  Clairvaux, based on the Songs of Songs, which was a crucial starting point for
  the mystic love theology of the Beguines.  He asserts, however, the central
  place eroticism holds in religious experience:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Eroticism is the most moving
      of all realities; but it is nonetheless, at the same time, the most ignoble. 
      ... the contradictory aspects of eroticism appear in some way innumerable;
      their profundity is religious — it is horrible, it is tragic, it is still
      inadmissible.  Probably all the more so because it is divine.... In casting
      eroticism out of religion, men reduced religion to a utilitarian morality.<a
  href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bataille is discussing, as he
  makes clear, <i>male</i> eroticism — the “essence of man”, as he describes it —
  which he carefully divides from an implicitly anerotic female sexuality of
  childbirth, care and nurturance.  The dark depths of sexuality, its sadism and
  connection with death, are clearly a male concern, and Woman, as represented in
  text and picture, is merely the object of inadmissible desire and fear, the
  Other on which is projected or enacted male desire.  For all Bataille’s
  eccentricity, he reflects a conventional discourse which dominates discussion
  of eroticism, the central male subject and the object of desire (boy, girl,
  Woman) predated by Death or the fixing gaze of the male onlooker. </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The sacred eroticism in the
  writings of mystic women is often no less violent than that lauded by
  Bataille.  But it includes a strikingly wider range of sensual reference than
  permitted into Bataille’s definitions: for example, Julian of Norwich’s rich
  descriptions of fluidity and flow in her lactating Christ, whose blood is milk;
  the places of all the senses in the writing, vision, touch, smell, taste,
  hearing; its insistence on “delight”, however it might be placed in the midst
  of suffering.  Gertrud of Heflta rehearses a typical trope:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>O most lovable radiance, when
      will you satisfy me with yourself?  If only I might here perceive the fine rays
      of your Venus-like beauty for a little while, and at least be permitted to
      anticipate your gentleness for a short time and pleasantly beforehand to taste
      you, my best share.  Ah, turn around now a little so that I may fix my look on
      you, flower of flowers.<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And until recently
  commentators have treated tended to skirt around such visions as Margareta
  Ebner’s suckling the infant Jesus:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>I have a statue of our Lord as
    a child in the manger.  I was powerfully attracted to it by my Lord with
    delight and desire and by His gracious request.  This was spoken to me by my
    Lord: “If you do not suckle me, then I will draw away from you and you will
    take no delight in me.”  So I took the image out of the crib and placed it against
    my naked heart with great delight and sweetness.... </p>
    <p>I am set afire by the ardent
      love coming from Him and am filled up by His presence and by His sweet grace so
      that I am drawn into the true enjoyment of His divine essence...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The eroticism of breast feeding has been
  so suppressed in contemporary life that a few years ago newspapers reported the
  case of a woman who rang an American radio station distressed by her sensual
  feelings while she was feeding her baby, and was arrested for child abuse.  (If
  that isn’t tragic, I don’t know what is.)  But this points to one reason why
  many expressions of female eroticism have been overlooked by commentators,
  apart from androcentric myopia: they are collected and neutralised under the
  anerotic rubrics of “motherhood” and, more complexly, those of “wife” and
  “bride”.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I do not have the space here
  to trace the suppression of female sexuality through the ages, from Aristotle
  to Freud, nor to examine in any but a schematic way the writerly intrigues
  inherent in the mystical texts.  But I am suggesting that these texts show
  women authorising their right to express themselves in writing and to speak in
  public as women in a multiplicity of ways: as neuter representatives of
  humanity in general; as rational and logical intellects; and as erotic, sensual
  women.  They do so by skirting the orthodoxies which limit their expressiveness
  with a variety of creative strategies.  To examine their works from a singular
  point of view is not enough; they must be read with a multiple awareness which
  takes into account the orthodoxies which surrounded and limited them.  And, as <i>specula</i>,
  as mirrors, these texts suggest intriguing ways of looking at contemporary
  practices.  They are most subversive in how they assert their rational basis
  within contemporary orthodoxies, which permits them to clear a space for a
  largely unheard female vocabulary which then becomes its own authority.  Mere
  emotion is not enough; mere intellectuality would not satisfy their desires nor
  permit a language for female expressiveness.  I find myself admiring the
  ingenuity of the mystics I’ve considered here in negotiating these
  contradictory necessities.  It seems to me a deeply poetic praxis.</p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Between the realities of the
  written text and the read text, what was experienced and what is imagined,
  there remains an unbridgeable gulf: historical, geographical and experiential. 
  I can refer only to the words on the page, and what is primarily communicated
  to me, as a secular contemporary reader, is a world of feeling.  But it is a
  singularly displaced experience of emotion, very far from the communications of
  feeling that are experienced, for example, in reading contemporary
  “confessional” poems: there is a sense in which these texts are radically
  impersonal, using distancing techniques and un-selving strategies in ways that
  can strikingly recall some contemporary poetics.  And there are other
  affinities with mysticism: for example, in his tract <u>The Poetics of
  L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</u>, Bruce Andrews demands “abjection”, a “humble and often
  ingratiating spirit”, for the act of reading.  He wants “The self, the imagined
  integrity, wrecked”, to release a state where “subjectivity gets felt as a
  complex bodily surface, with the familiarities of the person subject to an
  ecstatic clearing and extension”.  He asks: “Inscription on the body: shouldn’t
  we admit that this is how radical texts work?”   Andrews writes of the “flesh
  igniting”, as the mystics wrote of being devoured by the fire of love, and
  defines reading as atemporal, just as mystic texts assert visionary experiences
  exist “outside time”.<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a></p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">However, Andrew’s approach
  differs from the mystical “aesthetic”, if I may call it that, by eschewing
  meaning and rationality as harbingers of the textual authority his poems wish
  to disrupt.  This idea derives from the feminist practice of writers such as
  Helen Cixous and Luce Irigaray, who have explored the Lacanian notion of the
  feminine imaginary as a liberating focus for female expressiveness.  I am not
  saying that this is not a rich field for work, since I also work with some of
  these principles.  But I find a certain problem in this valorising of the
  pre-linguistic state as uniquely feminine, in that it does not greatly disturb
  traditional female ascriptions.  In the case of Bishop Arundel, it is clear
  that a purely emotional reaction to texts and scripture by lay people was
  considered desirable by the English Church, because it left intellectual
  textual interpretation to the authorities.  It is no accident, I believe, that
  writers as diverse as Gillian Rose and Lyn Hejinian have recently defended the
  idea of Reason, in different ways both severing reason from authority; they
  perceive that not to do so is to leave rationality as the unquestioned property
  of power.  Feminine irrationality courts the seductive danger of appearing to
  be subversive while in fact satisfying all sorts of time-hallowed prejudices
  about femaleness, and, if valorised within an implicitly male subject, can
  easily become again a category which leads to the exclusion of dissenting or
  strong female voices.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To conclude with a brief
  sojourn in the present, I have begun to think that the biggest effect of
  September 11 on me personally has been a return to concentrated thinking about
  gender and sex.  I was taken aback, in the days after the event, by how
  gendered arguments were hastily, even aggressively, dismissed on listservs, as
  if the issue of gender and sex is just a secondary, somewhat wimpish
  consideration in such extremities and has nothing to do with “important”
  discourses on the mechanisms of power.  I clearly think otherwise, and in
  looking into the mirrors of women writing 700 years ago, perhaps I was trying
  to clarify for myself some questions about what I see operating around me, in
  different ways, admittedly, but also in patterns which have a depressing
  familiarities.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Female silencing, as I hope I
  have shown, is a complex matter, and I add that such silence must be thought of
  in terms which admit aphasia as a possible silence.  The most potent silencing
  of women is, in a liberal democracy, that censorship observed by themselves. 
  David Howard’s recent complaint on the Poetryetc listserv is not untypical of
  many comments I’ve heard from poetry publishers over the past two decades:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>When I founded ‘Takahe’ in
      1989 the submissions in poetry were overwhelmingly from men — however the
      fiction submissions were far more balanced between men and women. This was the
      case for the five years of my stewardship. I pursued a policy of ignoring
      gender (and race, religion, height, weight, sexual tastes, colour of hair,
      favourite football team etc) in determining the make-up of any given issue.
      This meant that some issues featured work by nine men and three women, while
      others (generally through fiction contributions from women) reversed the
      statistical bias. It was, of course, only a statistical bias — something a few
      critics, including my successor as poetry editor, didn’t appreciate. After my
      retirement an unspoken quota was put in place which, in my view, undermined the
      fairness of the editorial process and reduced the overall quality of the
      journal. As Berenice Rubens commented, “I don’t want to be regarded as a Jewish
      British female novelist, I want to be regarded as a novelist who happens to be
      Jewish, British and female.’<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I’ll gloss over the question
  held in the words “statistical bias” here, because I want to focus on the
  question of women moving into public space.  My personal experience of editing
  shows me that the ratio of manuscripts submitted vary between one third and one
  quarter from women, and <i>Voices</i>, the magazine once published by the
  National Library of Australia, which kept records of all submissions, recorded
  a similar disparity.  I am certain that this is more the norm than otherwise. 
  This suggests that the prescription of silence for women is still active and
  still working, but it seems to be primarily activated by an inner censorship
  which makes it both difficult to define and very complex to trace.  And the old
  Romantic model of the male Poet is still alive and well, as Frances Presley
  points out:</p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Linda
      Russo’s point that “to be human and male is to write Poetry; to be female is
      talk and to grieve” holds true in England as in America. We even have a male
      poet laureate for such occasions. It seemed hardly less true of the avant-garde
      when at a large benefit performance held in London there were very few women
      performers.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The avant-garde of its nature
    suggests a male militaristic activity, and historically has tended to exclude
    women even more than its conservative counterparts. <a href="#_edn32"
  name="_ednref32" title="">[32]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The problematic public
  articulations of feeling over the past year or so suggest other areas of
  conjecture.  In her discussion of the political manipulation of public grief,
  Andrea Brady says public expressions of feeling inevitably are manipulated by
  conservative interests: “the reduction of political motivation to feelings,
  like maternal care, and political thinking to intuition, effectively restricts
  the political imaginary to local amelioration.”&nbsp; </p>
  
  
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Grief and other emotions are
      (if anything) over-articulated and indulged on the box.  The soft-focus morning
      interventions for housewives, the ‘spirit’ sections in Borders, the ‘Awareness
      Movement’ have raised an army of consumers of emotional health. <a
  href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Without arguing with Brady’s
  principal analysis, with which I agree, there is here an equation between
  “feminine” feelings (over-articulated and indulged housewives, maternal care)
  and the sentimental, which it would be well to wary of: it is uneasily close to
  traditional exclusions of women and women’s concerns from public discourse.  
  If sentiment can be thought of as a coarseness, failure or even <i>absence</i>
  of feeling, which I believe it is, then it is the sentimentalisation of public
  articulations of feeling which is the problem, rather than the expression of
  feeling itself.   Motherhood is not <i>a priori </i>an area of sentiment: and
  it might be interesting to inquire why its public portrayal almost always is
  sentimental, in the spirit of wondering what possibilities are hidden beneath the
  vaseline.  The commodification of feeling implicit in the phrase “consumers of
  emotional health” points to the reasons why this might have happened.
  Articulations of emotion in popular media often seem to me to be <i>suppressions</i>
  of feeling, rather than its articulation — they are expressions, rather, of
  aspirational material goals remarkable for their lack of connection to the
  complexity and liberating possibilities of actual emotions.  The constant
  conflation of these popular sentimental clichés with actual experiences no
  doubt accounts for a large percentage of the profit margins of pharmaceutical
  companies. </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In calling for a “language of
  feeling”, Frances Presley implies that the one we have is inadequate: what we
  have available is a discourse too easily hijacked by authority.  This suggests
  to me that the orthodoxies we are working with and against are so dominant as
  to be barely challenged within their own domains.  On the other hand, there are
  languages of feeling available to us: poetry being a major expression of them. 
  How poetry is marginalised and discounted within the wider culture is a whole
  other story.  I don’t believe this problem is unconnected with many of the
  questions I’ve raised here, but I’ll leave that for further discussion.  </p>
  
  
  
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I’d like to thank Robert
  Hampson and the Centre for Contemporary Poetics for giving me the chance to
  think about all this, and all of you for listening.</p>
