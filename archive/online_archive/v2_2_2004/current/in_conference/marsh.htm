<P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="CENTER">Go Grrrl: The
Zine and the PostLiterary </P>
<P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Nicky Marsh </P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The opening and closing terms of my rather gnomic
title deserve introduction. ‘Go grrrl’ is a reference to both the ‘riot grrrls’
of the early nineties and the ‘go-go’ girls of the sixties. The wording points
to my interest in what these sexually emancipated and ironic moments of
counter-culture offer a gendered critique, specifically in terms of shifting
figuration of the public and private subject. The ‘post-literary’ is Maria Damon’s term
for writing that takes place outside of
either the academy or established literary circles. For Damon this writing is
inspiringly expansive, ‘comfortable with its own politicisation, not
necessarily thematically but in its production, distribution and reception’. It
is, she suggests, ‘intuitively obvious’ that it ‘enables a multiplicity of
public spheres […] realms of gold, a utopian hetero-democracy made of charged
talk-language’. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This paper details the multiplicity of public
spheres offered by the self-publishing culture of the zine, and in particular
the ways in which women have been are able to operate within them. Its
narrative seeks to widen what a cultural analysis of ‘women and poetry’ can
include and gesture to the shifting terrain of a ‘second’ and a ‘third’ wave of
feminist praxis and critique. Its argument, more specifically, is that the
counter-public positioning of these post-literary ‘grrrl’ poets provides
insight into the complex relations of subversion and resistance in contemporary
poetry, reliant as much on the economic fields of production as the cultural
fields of consumption. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The ‘zine revolution’, a much-heralded mass popularisation of the
self-publishing practices of the earlier ‘mimeograph revolution’, was both
attentive and ambivalent toward the claims attributed to its democratisation of
cultural production. The role of poetry within such a mass movement inevitably
appeared far from central — a phenomena that
neither zine culture nor American poetry hurried to claim. It was two of
American avant-garde poetry’s most influential archivists, Buffalo’s Robert
Bertholf and Michael Basinksi, who followed the lead of other librarians
concerned with charting an amorphous, fragmented public culture who first
attempted to categorise it.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>
Their collaborative essay of the early nineties identified it with an
increasing experimentation with the visuals of signification, a response to the
waning of the referent, and a growing ‘non-literary audience’. They
characterise the texts according to a collage aesthetics made from ‘stolen or
plagiarised material, mixed with propaganda, featuring a strong enjambment of
print and visual media, which on occasion is meant to be to some extent
shocking or purposefully sexually violent — obscene in an old sense’. <a
href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a></p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The ‘obscene’ offers a usefully ambiguous trope for exploring both the zine’s modes of production and consumption and subject matter. In its most literal sense, the obscene refers
to the centrality of sexual explicitness in this writing. This writing’s insistent rendering of the marked, sexualised body both public and economically
significant breaches the codes of a public that assumes these relations to be private — disrupting what Michael
Warner describes as the ‘mirage’ of a‘pre-political humanity’ from which citizens are thought to emerge and to which
they are expected to return ‘in the (always imaginary) future after political conflict’.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a>
In so doing zine culture offers an interrogation of the constitution of the‘public’ in ways that make starkly evident and collective the experiential
intersections of class, of gender, of sexuality.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Yet
Baskinski and Bertholt’s description of the zine — as containing plagiarism and
propaganda, juxtaposing visual and print media — suggests an additional kind of
obscenity. The DIY culture’s palpable disregard for the niceties of completion,
copyright, consistency or visual harmony poses a clear affront to the category
of the literary itself: how one can read these texts is the most obvious and
pressing question that they pose. Consistently foregrounded in such apparently
unhoned literary productions is the possession of illegitimate and unsanctioned means of production and the need for
similar models of consumption. The possession of such means is, of course,
central to current readings of poetry as a counter-public sphere: it is
precisely this, most obviously, that Language poetry’s dialectical relationship
with the academy (‘provisionally complicit’ in the wise words of Alan Golding)
succeeded in achieving.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>
Yet zine culture’s desire for a <i>mass</i> <i>democratic</i> culture made it
quite distinct from Language writers whose investment was more properly
politically theoretical. As the editor of the poetry journal <i>Photostatic</i>
phrased it, he was indebted to LANGUAGE poets for formalizing ‘that its ok for
language to just be’ but cautious of their ‘cerebral’ tendencies. <a
href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> I want to use the ambiguity of
the zine’s reliance on the obscene — its effrontery
of literary as well as sexual mores — as a way of exploring its specific aims
for a mass, if necessarily ambivalent, movement within mainstream US culture.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The German theorists Oskar
Negt and Alexander Kluge’s model of the ‘proletarian’ public sphere offers one
way of further developing this aim. Negt and Kluge’s Marxist re-writing of
classic public sphere theory ascribes to the proletariat an ability to draw
attention to the contradictions of the bourgeois public sphere’s assumed
abstraction of experience. In literary terms this would correspond to a
challenging of the ‘institution of poethood’, an attenuation to the ‘imaginative strategies grounded in the experience
of alienated production  — protest energies, psychic balancing acts, a penchant
for personalization, individual and collective fantasy’, and an awareness that
such articulations are inevitably threatened by a reifying re-absorption.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a>
I want to read the zine’s ability to encompass such a difficult task: at once attempting to critically negate
the abstractions of the bourgeois sphere through articulating the ‘sensual substance’ of lived experience
whilst simultaneously deflecting the possibility of recuperation. Yet, as I want to make finally clear, such a
movement is consistently checked by the complex configurations of gender and
sexuality that it also poses — the careful ambivalence of its critiques becomes
unpredictable and chaotic once a critique of gender is brought into play. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The
zine gained an increased currency in American culture in the eighties as swathes of the small-press
industry began re-describing their activity in very particular ways. The
movement traced its composite histories not only to the poetic traditions of
small press publication but also to the pamphleteering of the eighteenth
century, the emergence of the national amateur press association of the
nineteenth century, the science fiction fanzines of the fifties, the Punk
Movement of the seventies.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> These rather catholic self-definitions at
least partly arose from the fact this writing was concerned to explore the
possibilities of cultures of independent publication beyond those that had
supported poetry. Most obviously, the zine
community was disdainful of the conventions of the mainstream: the zine <i>Bad</i>
<i>Poetry</i> <i>Digest</i>, for example, is censorially critical of the
emergence of what it calls ‘private writing’.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"
title="">[9]</a> Additionally, this resistance to
poetry seemed to result from a desire to radicalise minority forms of cultural
production in ways that were perceived as sitting uncomfortably with the high
points of American twentieth century poetic production — the modernisms of the
teens and twenties and the social movements of the sixties and seventies.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A principal academic
defender of the zine, Stephen Duncombe, has attributed the importance of the
movement to its ability to produce a strategy of cultural resistance specifically
in tune with the cultural changes of the eighties. The DIY culture, according to Duncombe, allowed work to be
reconceptualised as a site of protest within the ‘grim new economy of service,
temporary and flexible work’.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>
An important early principle, for example, was that the zine would not be sold
for profit. Their price was measured in terms of either covering the cost of
production and postage or, if this were free (typically zines were xeroxed and
sent, illegitimately, from work), then they were circulated in exchange for
other zines and cash omitted from the process. Zines also resisted the
categorisation that both commodification and collection demanded. The erratic
change of titles, the publishing pseduonyms, the irregular numbering, the inconsistent
dating, the ad-hoc methods of distribution and determinedly single-issue or
esoteric nature of the subject matter, all made this a field virtually
impossible to map in any coherent way.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The
subject matter of zines was also integral to their critique of the excesses and
banality of mainstream culture. A seditious relationship between labour and production,
often drawing attention to laws surrounding copyright and intellectual
property, was frequently foregrounded and mocked. Johnny R’s zine <i>‘SHOULDN’T
YOU BE WORKING’</i>, for example, takes pride in the fact that is ‘MADE
ENTIRELY AT WORK WHILE ON THE CLOCK AT BORDERS BOOKS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. I’M
HIDING BEHIND SOME BOOKSHELVES RIGHT NOW AS I WRITE THIS’. <a href="#_edn11"
name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">New formations of gender
were similarly central to this culture, reaching their height in the emergence
of the riot grrl movement embodied in zines
such as <i>Bust</i> and <i>Bitch</i>. From
its possibly apocryphal beginnings — ‘a list of men who date-raped’ written
onto ‘the third stall, second floor of the Library at Evergreen State College’
— then the movement sought to render its acts of unruly public articulation
politically meaningful.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>
One of the many versions of the Riot Girl Manifesto for example, urged its
members not only to ‘resist psychic death’ but to ‘cry in public’ and, by 1992,
a national network of chapters, workshops and rallies, zine writers and readers
had been established. <a href="#_edn13"
name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a>
According to an early commentator the movement was a reaction to mainstream
American feminism which had become, by the early nineties, either ‘increasingly
clouded in jargon’ or appropriated by the ‘pop-psychology industry, where every
conflict could be resolved from within’.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14"
title="">[14]</a>  riot grrrl’s breaking with both theory and
therapy allowed an articulation of the oppressions and pleasures they
identified with the corporeality of a gendered body. Cultural theorist Neil
Nehring’s defence of riot grrrl music, for example, reads its anger as a
powerful antidote to both feminist intellectualism and to Marxist accounts of
postmodern culture that insist on its passivity. Not only did women musicians
refuse to ‘be a victim of gendering that feminists have long sought’, Nehring
argues, but they also broke with ‘the elders’ intellectual-literary bent by
making self-creation a more exciting and attractive matter than studiously
absorbing feminist tracts or spinning out feminine ecriture for literary
theorists.’<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a>
Such gestures were read against the language of a third-wave feminism as it was
identified with both postmodern cultural studies and anti-foundationalist
gender theory. Ednie Garrison, for example, uses this vocabulary in order to
understand the formation of this movement as ‘both “popular” and subcultural’,
as providing an autonomous space that ‘can penetrate as an interface between different
third wave cohorts.’<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> 
</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The
function of poetry within riot grrrl seemed to be, in a
way that recalls second wave feminism, to provide a strategy of subjective
empowerment. In this, as in much about the movement, it was more indebted to
earlier moments in feminism than it often appeared prepared to acknowledge.
Most obviously it was populated by young white middle class women who
constantly risked replicating the power dynamics of the early stages of the
second wave; their attention to pleasure and the body risked occluding their
exclusionary implications. Riot Grrrl’s insistence on a separatist politics
also echoed the radical feminists of twenty years earlier and was damned by at
least one journalist as a ‘dead-end elitism’. <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17"
title="">[17]</a> Yet this separatism, like the media
black-out that riot grrrl imposed upon itself in 1992, was a resistance to
consumer culture rather than more generally and simply masculine-identified
institutions. It was an attempt to avoid riot grrrl’s transgressive sexual
images being appropriated by a consumer culture anxious to provide a lucrative
woman’s market with innovation, especially one marketable in terms of a
youthful and apparently liberating sexual voracity.<a href="#_edn18"
name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> Many
riot grrrl zines were determinedly personal in nature (as indeed were many
zines, giving rise to the ‘per-zine’ category), their subjects frequently
including sexual abuse and body image as well as desire, fashion and fantasy,
all of which were echoed in its poetry.<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19"
title="">[19]</a></p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The
poetry by Laura Joy Lustig suggests something of these complexities. The poem,
‘Death is Good If You Don’t Know How to Properly Be Alive’, is written using a
very generation-specific language and visual coding. </p>



<blockquote>
  <p >Talk 2<br>
&amp; squeeze<br>
    bush<br>
      tight. /<br>
      above ground<br>
      w/bones below.<br>
      Pelvis.<br>
      -inside its earth<br>
      where everyone above<br>
      loves 2 play psychic<br>
      w/<br>
      &amp; say they are<br>
      “@ peace”  <a
href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> </p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The
poem’s discussion of death is clearly encoded with a metaphoric frame of
reference that alludes — with its referencing of the ‘bush’ squeezed ‘tight’
and the pelvis ‘inside its earth’ — to sexuality. This connection not only
presents sex as terrifyingly macabre but also suggests both a rage and a
dependence on the saccharine banalities of a culture that conceals this
apparent grim inevitability with clichés. Yet this poem’s interspersing of
language with very contemporary visual codes and explicit language of the body
are suggestive of the resistant potential of the ‘obscene’ and the visceral to
these counter-cultural communities.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Clearly the relationship between zines and mainstream culture
was more complicated than Duncombe’s language of covert radicalism allows.
Publications that seemed to represent the most vital aspects of this culture,
those which most neatly embodied its ironical attacks on consumption or its new
configurations of identity politics, became successful beyond its confines. The
zine <i>Beer Frame: the Journal of Inconspicuous Consumption</i>, for
example, provided a counter-culture consumerist guide. The contradictions of
such a status were fully realised as it grew from being 500 copies xeroxed at
work and handed to friends into a paperback and finally to a column in <i>New
York</i> magazine.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a>
Zines such as <i>FactSheet Five</i>, <i>Bitch and Bust</i> similarly gained
international publishers and distribution. A few individual writers also
enjoyed this kind of exposure. Pagan Kennedy’s novel, <i>Zine</i>:<i>How I found Six Years of my Life and finally..... found myself....I
think</i>, turned her involvement in this community into a rather generically
predictable teen bildungsroman.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22"
title="">[22]</a></p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Such equivocations are
further and more specifically complicated in literary zines by their debt to a
heritage that owes much not only to the counter-cultural movements of the
eighties but to earlier literary movements. It is not difficult to trace the
aspirations of zine culture to Ray Johnson’s parodic New York School of
Correspondance or to the Eternal Network. The trajectories of Mail Art’s
‘demand for ‘No More Masterpieces’, and its concomitant positing of posted
objects, flyposters, rubberstamping and cassettes as art, are all recognisable
within this culture. The political impetus behind these practices, described as
a ‘kind of improvisational jazz’ combining ‘Dadaism, Nouveau Realisme,
Futurism, Fluxus, and Situationalism’, clearly influence the claims made on
behalf of zine culture by commentators such as Duncombe.<a href="#_edn23"
name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> Such connections are made
explicit in the writing of Stephen Perkins who includes the Neoist group, the
‘Smile’ journal and the Praxis Group as examples of zine culture.<a
href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a>.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The predominately literary
journals associated with the zine movement — such as <i>Lost and Found</i> <i>Times</i>,
<i>Vile</i>, <i>Assembling</i>, <i>Nitrous Oxide, Photostatic, Poetry Motel</i>
— reconciled the radical aims of these avant-garde movements and the more
populist democratic aspirations of the zine in what appeared to be productively
tension-filled ways. There are two specific points of this potentially
contradictory overlapping that I want to further elucidate before going
exploring the particular ambiguities of zine poetry. Usefully, the prolific poet
and critic Johanna Drucker provides avenues into both.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Firstly, Drucker’s
attention to a tradition of materiality in literature, of the ‘marked’ text as
opposed to the self-effacing textual tradition of Gutenberg, illuminates much
about the treatment of textuality in zine culture. For Drucker, visual writing
supersedes phenomenology’s over-determined
choice between the transcendent and the corporeal.<a href="#_edn25"
name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> This
attention to the visual and material aspects of textuality were most obviously
present in zine culture’s prioritising of a visual aesthetic. Zines and
small-press journals such as <i>Core, Atticus</i>, <i>Co-Lingua, NRG </i>and <i>Photostatic</i>
were explicit in regard to presenting this agenda.<a href="#_edn26"
name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> In <i>Photostatic</i>, for
example, the visual poet Harry Polkinhorn elevated the visual above the verbal
as language has ‘effectively committed suicide’ because of its vain attempts to
repress and excise its ‘connections to the filth, murder, and suffering of
experience’ whereas the former is replete with what Polkinhorn calls ‘its concretised
charge of human labor’.<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a>
Frequently these publications were<i>
</i>as knowing as Drucker with regard to
their modernist implications. The secondary title of<i> Photostatic</i>,
for example, was ‘Retrofuturism’, and the work of Walter Benjamin and the 1913
armoury show were included amongst the journal’s themed dedications.<a
href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a></p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Secondly, but perhaps more
obviously in this context, Drucker points to the connections between feminism
and the poetry and visual art communities clustered around seminal journals
such as <i>Meaning</i> or <i>How(ever) </i>in the US from the seventies onwards<i>.</i><a
href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a> Women poets and artists as
varied as Bernadette Mayer, Anna Banana and Eve Enslar were influential to
publications such as <i>0-9</i>, <i>Vile</i> and <i>Central</i> <i>Park</i>
respectively. The work of each of these writers suggests that the clear overlap
between experiments in the visual arts, networking movements and the
counter-culture was consistently capable of incorporating a gendered critique.
More broadly, the contributions of figures such as Lucy Lippard and Alison Knowles
to the communities of mail-art and fluxus, and the moves toward a visual
poetics in the work of writers such as Susan Howe, Kathleen Fraser, Norma Cole
and Joan Retallack, suggest the parallels between this work and a
deconstructive feminist critique.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Yet the influence of both
a visual-modernist aesthetic and an interrogation of gender’s signifying
economies were rather more ambivalently figured in zine culture than the
presence of such influences may imply. Most obviously, as titles such as
‘Retrofuturism’ suggest, zine culture’s mode of address was clearly informed by
the flat ironies of a postmodern mode of address. The zine <i>Poetry Motel </i>edited
by Patrick MacKinnon is published in Minnesota by ‘Suburban Wilderness Press’,
an obvious reference to its ex-centric urban position and to its critique of
mainstream America culture. The index refers to page numbers as motel rooms,
its review section is titled ‘Room Service’ and its editorial is ‘No Grants, No
Pets, No Sonnets’. The zine’s inclusion of visual poetry is supplemented by its
bringing adverts into the signifying field of the page. The poem ‘The Passage
Into Manhood’ is framed by three adverts and like those around it on the page,
proffers a dystopian vision of the end of childhood. <a href="#_edn30"
name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a> In this particular poem the
isolation and terror of ‘manhood’ are rendered physically literal, the subject
is trapped in a room without windows, doors or light. The poem is somewhat
Beckettian; the contradictory stage directions, the emphasis on sight, the
moment of final terror all evoke Beckett’s late prose. The adverts around the
poem are for The Vassar Navy Blazer, for ‘Infa Family Time’ and for a rather
unlikely first edition bible that is selling for $3500. Including these texts
in our reading of the poem changes it. From being a rather crude pastiche of
late modernist angst, the simultaneous crisis in masculinity and in
metaphysics, it becomes a critique of American culture. The concept of giving
family time a logo, the selling of the symbols of real privilege suggested by
the Vassar Blazer and the high expense of spirituality all suggest a more
direct explanation for the scream at the end of the poem that is otherwise
missing. Because the other poems on the page share this existential pain — the
loss of childhood, the fear of loneliness and madness, the search for meaning —
then these crude pasted-in adverts also allowed them to be connected, to
provide a narrative of meaning that they individually lack.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The vocabulary for
discussing the gender critique offered in these journals needs to be similarly
cautious. Although younger ‘grrrl’ poets such as Laura Joy Lustig published in poetry zines such as <i>Plastic
Tower</i> and visual poets and feminist activists such as, respectively,
Janet Janet and Ruthann Robson were published in zines such as <i>Photostatic </i>and<i>
Co-Lingua </i>such an overtly gendered critique was far from a routine feature.
The equivocations in zine culture with regard to both a feminist critique and
the cultural implications of an experimental or transformative poetic aesthetic
can be read as revealing not only an anxiety about the implications of such
modes but an awareness of what they risk occluding. It is to these
ambivalences, at the heart of a working class oppositional culture, to which I
want to finally turn.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Zines such as <i>MalLife,
Poetry Motel, Lost and Found Times,</i> <i>Slipstream, Plastic Tower</i> and <i>Lilliput
Review </i>are marked by a fabulously diverse range of poetry and contributors.
The work of poets such as Harry Polkinhorn, Crag Spencer and even Charles Bernstein
is routinely positioned against the frequently highly sexualised narrative voice poems of poets such as Cheryl Townsend, Lyn Lifshin and Paul Weinman.
My interest is in what these unlikely juxtapositions suggest for the
possibility of what I have been terming an aesthetic of the ‘obscene’ that
seeks to reconcile the ambivalent implications of both feminism and modernism
with the ‘experience of alienated
production’ in order to posit new forms of transformative poetics. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Women poets have been much
more clearly active in a working class underground self-publishing culture than
even narratives of the feminist poetry movement have been able to acknowledge.
The industry surrounding Charles Bukowski, who roughened the conventions of
mainstream mimetic verse by including a parodic, violent and sexualised content
within it, has given a fairly central role to the work of women poets. The
long-running journal <i>Wormwood Review, </i>for example, often also included
the work of ‘go-go girl’ women poets such as Joan Jobe Smith, Lyn Lifshin, Ann
Menebroker and Linda King. From within the community explicitly referenced by
this journal sprang a number of publications, such as the journals <i>Pearl </i>and
<i>Purr</i>, edited by women explicitly concerned with accounting for their
experience within this moment of counter-culture. The overt sexualisation of
the writing in these journals was seen as emancipatory. This entailed a
rejection of perceived literary separatism and an attention to the sexual pleasures and erotic energies of heterosexuality.
Sex is used in these poems as a source of humour, a source of self-effacement,
a source of resistance, a source of anger, a source of income as well as a
source of emotional and physical pain and pleasure.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This aspect of women’s
writing became increasingly successful in the eighties as it identified itself
with zine culture. Cheryl Townsend’s journal, <i>Impetus,</i> began in 1984 and
although publishing many of the same poets as <i>Pearl </i>was able to command
a broader readership which allowed it to run successfully for over a decade.
The rendering of femininity, in terms of sexuality, economics, a deeply
ambivalent source of power, remained a central characteristic of this writing.
Yet the vulnerability of women’s sexual and economic identity is also made
clear, and the visual possibilities of the cut and paste DIY aesthetic used to
articulate this. The fourth of the ‘Women Only’ editions of the journal poems
such as ‘One Out of Every Four Women Gets Raped’, for example, provides a
striking visual image of what is presented as a bald fact of abuse. The poem is
suggestive of the absurdity of such statistics, the gap between the crudeness
of the structure and the baldness of the title indicating how reductive such
pieces of information are in terms of the actual experiences of women: </p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The graphic and sardonic
representation of the child’s game is overlaid with a number of different
evocations of femininity. They suggest the passivity of the hunted fowl, the
domesticity of the cooked bird, they even suggest flirtatious and maternal
overtures — to be goosed, to be somebody’s duck.</p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;</p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A consideration of women’s
general relative economic and cultural powerlessness is also heavily present in
this writing. This analysis of economic power takes a number of poetic forms.
In some cases the alienating effect of the routinized labour upon which these
women appeared to be dependent is rendered very literally. A poem by andrea
mackinnon (a name itself, which in an elision of feminism’s two most radical
cultural critics may well be made up) called ‘lounge poem’, also published in
1985, for example, seems to be little else than the pad upon which a waitress
in bar might record the orders: </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>2 vod<br> 
      br<br> 
      vod mar<br>
      sm &amp; kur<br>

    br  ch</p>
  <p>lite   <a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32"
title="">[32]</a></p>
</blockquote>




<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The fragmented list, which
only occasionally suggests recognisable words and at time barely even registers
as sound, evokes the instrumentalism of the woman’s social interactions. The
irony of the last word, where light refers neither to illumination,
weightlessness or frivolity but to the brand of a beer, suggests the only
critical note in the poem. It is not simply that language has been corrupted
through abbreviation but that the speaker has been alienated from language.
That the other recognisable words in the poem are wind and lamb, which share
the same connotations of freedom as lite, allows this critical irony to stand,
quite literally, on its own. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Anxieties about access to
mainstream forms of authority can also be read from these publications, which
seems at least partly rooted in a concern with maintaining their circulation
and financing. <i>Impetus</i> off-sets this misgiving by a literal and
intelligent use of adverts. The journal initiated a program called ‘The Flyer
Exchange’ which offered advertising either for cash or on a free reciprocal
basis. These adverts not only allow the journal to financially survive, but also
lend it a credibility not always apparent in its confessional roughened poetry.
In an editorial called ‘The Cat’s Meow’ in 1989 Townsend notes with obvious
satisfaction that the journal’s reliance on distribution through exchange has
been superseded and that it has begun appearing in bookshops and in the trade
press.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Elsewhere these tensions
become even more insistent. In a ‘Women Only’ issue of the journal, for
example, adverts for feminist pressure groups are placed next to poems. In <i>Women
Four</i>, for example, an advert for a pro-choice movement is included next to
a poem about abortion. On the one hand such advertisements serve a literal
function, providing public service information to women and allowing the
journal to identify with mainstream organised feminist debate. At the same time
the obvious visual and typographic contrasts of placing an entirely subjective
first person account next to a public advert for a pressure group foregrounds
the different authorities, the different reading modes, of these two
discourses. The marked block of the advert and the unmarked italicised
narrative of the poem interpolate the reader very differently — the gap between
a public and a private articulation is being rendered very clearly. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The same thing occurs in
the ‘erotic’ editions of the journal, ‘Impish Impetus’, but adverts for women’s
groups are replaced with personal ads — ‘country gal seeking teddy bear for /
serious relations. Likes country  / music, travel, slow dancing, warm /
moonlite nights’. These presentations are shorn of the details that would allow
them to literally function as adverts, the ironical contrast between them and
the poems around them is consequently more evident. At play seem two different
formal conventions for representing sexual identity and desire. The poem’s
baldly erotic if clichéd fantasies — ‘I lie outside your bedroom / window and
dream / of your tongue’ — contrast against the factual fantasies of the ads
‘Male 27, 6’3’’, 200lbs, blue eyes, brown hair, looking for a serious relationship,
woman who likes dining out’. Here the ironical gap between the two increases
the absurdity of both the lyrical staging of the obscene and the aggressive
marketing of sexual desire. <a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a></p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Yet
not all zine writing was able to so productively negotiate the ambivalent
freedoms that its positioning outside of mainstream culture suggests. Zine
writing also demonstrates the real limitations of a proletarian counter-sphere,
as the opportunity to articulate what Negt and Kluge term a ‘proletarian’ lived
experiential — to be ‘obscene’ in order to expand what it means to be public —
risked constant recuperation by the reifying mechanism of publicity. In this
writing, ironically, the awareness of artifice becomes evidence not of the
potential for critique and resignification but of powerlessness, a collapse
into complicity with a mainstream agenda.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poet Lyn Lifshin’s
writing is nearly all written in the autobiographical first person voice. Her
interest in the significance of this as a form for women’s writing, and its
relationship to questions around the nature of the divisions between the public
and private for women has been demonstrated in her editing of women’s private
writing. Her two anthologies <i>Ariadne’s</i> <i>Thread </i>and <i>Lips Unsealed: Confidences
from Contemporary Women Writers</i> collect a broad range of women’s private
writing. The collections were motivated, as Lifshin suggests in her
introduction to the former, by the tension between her pleasures in ‘the life,
often the inner life, secrets and adventures of a sensitive, perceptive
narrator’ and the absence of ‘politics, history or society’.<a href="#_edn34"
name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a>
Lifshin’s writing is clearly available to a feminist reading. It has
consistently pushed at the conventions of self-representation, frequently
questioning and parodying issues of female identity and their relationship to
iconography. In one edition of <i>Wormwood Review, </i>for example, she
published over thirty poems from her lengthy sequence of ‘Madonna’ poems. Each
of these very short, often humorous poems, turns upon its neat encapsulation of
a cliché of femininity — from Bikini Madonna, ‘what she / revels of /
interesting / what she hides is vital’, to High Interest Rate Madonna,
‘comforts the / greedy afflicts / the needy’. One of the most satirical aspects
of these poems is their sheer quantity, the amount suggests both the mutability
of female identity, that it can simultaneously be so many things, and yet this
very plenitude suggests the plasticity of the endless recycling and
reappropriations of hegemonic authority.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This
large body of texts has made Lifshin nothing less than one of the most
productive poets writing in America. Her profligacy is, indeed, almost
unseemly, testament for some to the lack of discrimination in the
micro-publishing community. The new formalist R.S Gwyn’s acerbic account of
contemporary publishing uses the fact that Lifshin tops Len Fulton’s
‘sweepstake’ of the most published ten poets in 1990 as evidence of the general
banality of contemporary writing: the fact that the other poets in the list include
Marge Piercy, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov and Robert Creeley is uncommented
upon. <a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="">[35]</a>
I want to contrast the various ways in which Lifshin has been published in an
effort to provide someway of reading this excess, and also in order to relate
it back to the ambiguities around formal experimentation, gender and class that
dominated zine culture.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lifshin
has been published by a broad range of zines, by mainstream magazines, by
academic journals and, most recently, by a fairly major publishing house. Many
of her earliest publications were in self-authored zines or chapbooks published
by the small press. One of these is the collection <i>Offered by Owner</i>
published in 1978. The collection shares many of the features of a mainstream
publication. It includes a contents page, an introduction and its cover
features a professionally coy photograph of the artist. The introduction —
comparing publishing poetry and selling of real estate — suggests not only the
central theme of the book but also how its author imagines the relationship
with the reader. It links us autobiographically to the writer whilst
positioning the reader as an active, potentially judgmental, recipient, with
the power to buy or reject what is being offered. The poems do nothing to
disrupt this. They present a number of feminised anxieties — about body image,
about access to education, about maternal relationships — not untypical to
second-wave feminist poetry. These are sandwiched between photographs of the
maturing author that provide an alternative commentary on what is being read.
Hence, a photo of Lifshin looking youthful and slim in a classic
nineteen-fifties pose is given a very specific meaning when published between a
poem called ‘Fat’ and a poem called ‘His Dangling Pronoun’. The second of these
poems is a fantasy of teacher seducing her ‘favorite student dark and just /
back from the army with those / hot olive eyes’. The first is a far more
internalised account of a woman loathing her excess weight: ‘it hangs around /
reminding you of what / wasn’t totally / digested   a layer of heavy / water,
something greasy’. The picture clearly operates in the gap between these two
poems: we are being offered it as a way of sharing the fantasy, of confirming
its authenticity. The woman’s naked elegantly poised legs in the photograph
echo the ‘shaved up high’ and ‘soft nougat thighs’ of the erotic poem. Yet it
also provides a discordant context for the surfeit of memories in ‘Fat’. The
smiling woman of the photographic image is rendered vulnerable as we are told
of the narrative voice’s violent self-image: ‘I used to put the scales back 10
pounds / I still do and would have beat myself with the heaviest rubber chains
[….] jessica’s mother once said / lyn you’ll never get / cold this winter / fat
legs / like that’. <a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="">[36]</a>
The effect of the contrast, of course, is to consider the woman’s body as
simultaneously a source of anxiety and pleasure. The deep ambiguities of
self-identity are made intrinsic to the production of the zine itself: its
tendency to speak directly to the reader, to literalise authorship, to depend
upon models of exchange rather than commodification. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When republished by Black
Sparrow in the rather superfluously entitled ‘autobiography’ section of the
smart and thick <i>Cold Comfort: Selected Poems 1970-1996</i> then many of
these tensions are removed from the poem. It is streamlined: the small i’s so
characteristic of zine writing have been capitalised, its detailed specificity
is expunged and reference to the present played down. The lines cited above
become ‘I put the  / scales back, would have / beat myself with / rubber chains
[…] Somebody once said / you’ll never get  / cold this winter / fat legs / like
that’. <a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37]</a>
The result is, of course, that the poem becomes almost entirely generic: a
rather uncompelling account of a widely recognised and familiar condition. The
resonances of its location next to both a specific image of femininity and an
alternative fantasy of self are lost. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lifshin’s work was also
published in the mainstream popular press, including <i>Rolling Stone</i> and
in <i>Ms. </i>Her appearance in the latter, a seminal text of mainstream
feminism, is interesting for its apparent inversion of many of the critical
demands and assumptions of both zine and academic culture. Lifshin published
her elegiac poem ‘Alberta Hunter’, in the year of the singer’s death, in <i>Ms.</i>
The poem uses Hunter’s iconographic status — as an aged woman performing in
public, as a jazz singer, as a liberated woman — to strike a note of defiant
optimism. It uses the specific history and name of the woman who began life in
Memphis, went North to Chicago on a dime and carried on singing until her death
at 85, ‘her hair pulled / straight back    not / to miss anything’ to suggest a
progressive narrative for women’s liberation.<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38"
title="">[38]</a>
The other facts that make Hunter’s success so remarkable — her race, her
sexuality — are either ignored or assumed simply by her name. Yet the poem
appears toward the end of the magazine, slotted in to the lengthy ‘small ads’
sections that such publications routinely contain. The critical relationship
posed by the juxtaposition of poetry and adverts suggested by <i>Impetus </i>or
<i>Poetry Motel</i> seems almost entirely inverted<i>.</i> The barest space is
given to the poem. It appears on a corner of page eighty and is crowded and dulled
by the profusion of colour, boldness of type, and excessive detail of the
adverts that surround it. The poem’s universalising expectancy — provided by
the contrast between the boldness of its hope and the lightness of its
biographical touch — are lost as they jostle against the jaunty tone and large
print of an advert for ‘Apricot flavored Brandy’ and the details that the
selling of an ‘Odor-Free Litter Box’ and ‘Authentic RAF Sweater’ apparently
require. That the political freight of the poem, in terms Lifshin’s
intersection as both a feminist and zine writer, should be so casually lost is
in keeping with the fate of <i>Ms </i>in the mid-eighties as its reliance on
advertising revenue came into increasing conflict with its feminist aims. <a
href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title="">[39]</a> </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">However, the dynamics
around the various publications of Lifshin’s many works are more complex than
this perhaps predictable account of the homogenising and depoliticising
implications of mainstream publications suggests. Lifshin’s work was also
collected and published by other zine publishers. The zine ‘he wants his meat
in the woman who’s dead’, for example, is about Lifshin but written by a fan
and is suggestive of the alternative stakes in the circulation of writing
within the zine communities. The editorial begins fairly neutrally, noting that
the author in question has ‘probably written and published more poems than
anybody in the history of the world.’ Its end, thanking ‘LYN’ for being ‘the
only poet who’s satisfied my need’ resonates with more visceral tones. The effect
of Lifshin’s more violently sexual writing shifts, the piling up of narratives
of violent abuse against women becomes disconcerting when formed by an editor
who calls himself the rather militaristic, even fascistic-sounding,
‘Generalimisso’. The poems are cut and pasted onto a chaotic black and white
backdrop. The narrowing of the white space around the words, the sudden endings
of the poems all adding not only to their frantic tones but also to the sense
in which they are active in a fantasy in which they are not necessarily
complicit. This sense is at its strongest when one of the sources for violent
fantasies that the poems contain is presented. The cutting from a newspaper of
the story of a violent murder of a woman, once placed next to Lifshin’s poem
about the subject is very uneasy in this context. The story refers to an
investigation into the possibility that a cult was responsible for the
sacrificial murder and cannibalism of a woman. The name of the cult, the last
words in the story, is ‘The Church of the Realized Fantasy’. In this context
then the production of a source for Lifshin’s poem seems to be neither
manipulating questions around the poem’s authenticity nor demonstrating how
Lifshin’s astonishing creativity is maintained so much as suggesting above all
the fantasy that her fantasies can be realised.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The counter-cultural
poetry scene offers a place in which new formations of community and identity
are clearly able to be rehearsed and the very possibility of the public is
expanded and enriched through this. Yet our ability to read this only as a site
of opportunity or subversion needs, I think, to be more carefully considered.
Such oppositional writing is also necessarily cut through with the realities of
class, and the complex identifications of gender, that consistently render them
more ambivalent. The real obscenities in this writing remain, consequently,
often beyond representation. </p>
