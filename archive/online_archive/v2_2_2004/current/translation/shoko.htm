<p class="TITLE3"><a name="poem1"></a>Spring</p>
<p class="HALFSPACE">The shade in the rose-colored covered wagon rocks the window curtain facing out on the park. It was exactly a small heart. In the middle of the green barley field it stopped suddenly, and then, like a hand that touched the window curtain, like a Dutch wall clock, like something one remembers, it began to move, the white fingertips joined as if in prayer, although in the hall of the mansion a bottle with a delicate colored pattern collapsed under the weight of fragrant flowers… Ah, there is the dear familiar tree of grandmother, thrusting its dull lead-colored cane. — I lay a book called Green Garden face down on my knees. (A young composer died on just such an afternoon.) A stone staircase begins to dream. A faint cloud. That was also a small bird with cool feathers like the ice that still continued to sleep. — As I descend this staircase to the lawn, a splendid rite of spring is being performed at the lower reaches of the blue stream, a repainting of the paint on the bottom of a ship. </p>

<p class="TITLE3">Vineyard
  <a name="poem2"></a></p><p align="left" class="HALFSPACE">Dreams, wrapped around people like capes, blow in the wind — happiness opens pupils, and one can hear the gentle voice of conversation here and there. In the end, all hearts like mirrors slid down. Between the lace threads of wind that untied themselves and wrapped around every tree trunk, people, imitating birds, continue to come and go in little mincing motions under the blue silk sky. The pigeon that flies out of a cloud, the watering can in the thicket, and the rattan chairs in the shadow of the trees — soon dusk rose from these, and the glistening leaves began to appear, jostling one another. But all we can hear at the moment is the sound of their touching one another, like silver coins. </p>

<p><strong class="TITLE3">Mouse</strong><a name="poem3" id="poem3"></a></p><p>Lurking in the shade of scales lit up with summer<br>
  Feeding on a cluster of grapes, silver-<br>
  clothed, sometimes barefoot<br>
  Ah, worrisome diver<br>
  The traveler climbing up onto a coral island<br>
  can peek<br>
  at the sun sinking in the distance<br>
  Where laughter floats<br>
  Evening lace with a flutter<br>
  dangles from the ceiling<br>
  The hand that lifted the seaweeds<br>
  As if it had suddenly remembered<br>
  stopped moving the spoon<br>
  That is the voice of the princess Scheherazade… </p>
