<div class=Section1>
        <P class="HALFSPACE"><strong>D.O:</strong> For the past decade or so you have 
  been living away from London in Hebden Bridge in Yorkshire, how has this shift 
  from the urban to the rural environment affected your poetics?</p>
<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O&#8217;S:</b> Living in place in close relation beside 
  other-than-human sentience has deepened my trust in the provisional, the precarious, 
  in the precisions of the transient &#8211; of &#8220;what is not yet known, thought, seen, 
  touched but really what is not.  And 
  that is&#8221; (Eva Hesse)<sup><a href="#1">1</a><a name="1b"></a></sup></p>


<P class="HALFSPACE">&#8230; having a feeling of being part of an intimate, 
  boundless, round-me turning of &#8220;Non, nothing, everything (Eva 
  Hesse)<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> <a name="2b"></a>&#8211; aware of the sky as an infinite environment of ephemeral 
  vice versa imperatives and winged pathings &#8211; particularly at transitional 
  times of great energy such as spring and autumn&#8230;  and the blizzards, the driving, horizontal 
  rains and the battering winds. And the sonic plunging of water to the earth, 
  into the becks, springs and falls&#8230; </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">&#8230;such breaking up and breaking apart within utterances and
hearings, de-constructing/re-constituting-as-(being)-heard is embodied in my
poetics&#8230;</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">I seem to have moved away from making the large colourful
expressionistic assemblages/paintings I did in London (when I was in my
thirties) and right up to about the mid-nineties, (when I was in my forties)
when I was first here &#8211; side by side with my making poetry - towards my work
now &#8211; where potencies, energy fields, traces of actions/activities move in an
open, ongoing dissolving/deformance of the verbal/visual/sculptural into one
practice of many heuristic pathings. </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.: </b>When I read or hear you talk about your
work I am struck by the rich terminology which you employ to reference your
poetics. Words and phrases such as &#8220;deformance&#8221; and
&#8220;re-constituting-as-(being)-heard&#8221; imply a sense of violence and destruction as
well as an assembling of raw materials and energies. A &#8220;re-constituting-as-
(being)-heard&#8221; suggests that writing, for you, is bound up with recapturing the
fleeting sense of an overheard, or chance encounter which one is never fully
able to be part of or reassemble. It seems to me that the place of the page for
you is a place of transformation but also of struggle, dissolution and loss.
Would you agree with that?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S:</b> Yes. A place of damage, savagery, pain, silence:  also a place
of salvage, retrieval and recovery.   A place of existence, journeying. A sacred space of undiminishment. Of dream. Of ritual.  Of magic.   Also a &#8220;re-constituting-as-(being)-heard&#8221; in the sense that as we hear, we also are heard in an intertwining of potential exchange of hearing-(being)-heard of other-than-(as well as human)-sentience.</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.:</b> You have mentioned your need for &#8220;other-than-human sentience&#8221; in your environment. Animals feature in many of
your poems, especially<i> An Incomplete Natural History</i> (1984<i>), From the
Handbook of That &amp; Furriery</i> (1986), <i>Unofficial Word</i> (1988), how
does this understanding of the &#8220;other-than-human&#8221; find its way into your poems?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S:</b> I spend a lot of time in the hearing of
birds/hearing birds, and indeed all manner of animals.  I feel part of a particular kind of
multi-sonic/trans-somatic environment that is filled with other-than-human
voicings/breathings /existences - that is always in flux, in-process,
unhushed.  </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">I have always felt tremendous empathy with animals.  As a child, I was appalled at the casual
cruelties and unquestioning hatred and abuse of animals in the world at large.  Exploitation and violation of other-than-human beings underpins our society and is embedded at every level in
our h/arming hierarchies. I always felt I was no different from other animals. Having lived beside/shared life with animals, I feel this more passionately
than ever now.  The celebration of the transformative, merciful intelligences and energies of animals is in all my work. </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.: </b>I was wondering how this understanding of
the &#8220;other-than-human sentience&#8221; might have impacted in a formal way on your
poetics? I was thinking of the way in which it might go hand-in-hand with an
opening up of the usual structures of language and communication. A movement towards
a feeling for the other that also entails an <i>other</i> form of writing; one
that draws on and engages with cycles and energies not defined as human? </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S: 
</b> New/ancient forms of imaginings
without limits that engage with evolving multi and meta-physical breathing/soundings
and fluidities - &#8216;human&#8217; or &#8216;page&#8217; or &#8216;dog&#8217; or &#8216;keyboard&#8217; or &#8216;waterfall&#8217; -
where does one threading run out to begin another? </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.:</b> Artists such as Ana Mendieta, and
writers such as Cecilia Vicuna would seem to have much in common with your
approach to landscape, ritual and indeed performance.  How do you see yourself in relation to this tradition of female
artists who are working directly with the landscape in relation to their own
bodies?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.:</b> Much of what I&#8217;ve already said above
could be said again here &#8211; particularly, the drawing upon the earth and the
other-than-human  &#8211; voicing my
body/bodying my voicings &#8211;  Cecilia
Vicuna&#8217;s powerful practise has been particularly meaningful for me:
particularly her commitment to what I call an eco/ethico politics of the earth. </p>

<P class="HALFSPACE"><b> D.O.:</b> There also seems to be some very interesting connections between Vicuna&#8217;s
weaving and shaping of natural objects detritus and your own practice of
weaving and assemblage on the page, and indeed in performance. I was thinking
of your description of the performance of <i>From The Handbook of that &amp; the Furriery </i>in 1983 in which you wove a red net down the central aisle
between the seated people and your voice was accompanied by your taped voice,
as well as slides. I understand that you wove yourself around the edges of the
room, and in effect around all of the audience. Is this weaving in of the
audience something that you see as being like Vicuna&#8217;s weaving of spaces and
territories? Vicuna seems to me to be weaving across spaces in an attempt to
problematise and disrupt the comfortable space of the detached spectator? Was
this true of your performance?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.:</b> Yes. IMPLICATION was at the core of that
performance. I mentioned the page as a place. Also, profoundly, its
PLACELESSNESS.  And what&#8217;s going on away
from the page &#8211; moving through space and time to DISPLACEMENT of the page.</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.:</b> There is clearly a strong relationship
between live performance and writing in your work which is clearly evident in
your readings.  I wonder if you could
tell me a little about how this relationship shapes your working
processes?  </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.:</b> My work has always been
body-intensive - writing by hand, redrafting the words by hand &#8211; bending,
sticking, cutting, shaping marks, shaping sounds into the recorder, pain(t)ing
and building &#8211; all inscriptions of my body&#8217;s breathing.  This heuristic trans-forming has become
paramount in <i>murmur</i> where I am using the sight/site of the
ear/page as a foundational textu(r)al, sonic, visual bodily dimension to move
out from.</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.: </b>You seem to be describing a kind of
synaesthesic practice that is moving towards an interchange of senses: hearing
seems to become sight and vice-versa. Do you feel that the relationship between
language and each of the senses is also something that you are working to interrogate
and transform?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S: </b>Yes, very much so. </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.:</b> I know that the artist Joseph Beuys has
been an important influence for you. How do you relate to his concept of the
artist as a kind of shamanic figure who is capable of transformation and
healing through the process of art making? Is this idea something which has
political resonance for you now?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S:</b> For me, his widened/wide-open concept of total human
compassionate creative living &#8211; his &#8220;social sculpture&#8221; - his processual trust
in the mysteries and soul imbued in material is transFORMative &#8211; melting across
all apartheids of genre and specialism.</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">Yes, it does have resonance for me at ALL possible levels &#8211; PER/forming/TRANS/forming within a poetic intuitive process as a first step in
opening up possibilities for radical changes in and between consciousnesses.</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.:</b> Clearly the late Bob Cobbing was also important to you, in terms of publishing
and encouraging your early work?  Could
you say a little about how he specifically influenced you? </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.:</b> A good deal of what I feel about Beuys
could also, apply to Bob Cobbing &#8211; for Bob too, there was simply no division
between the engagements of living life and the imaginative processes of
working. Bob embraced and celebrated the multi-form with energy and ease. </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">I met him I think when I was 20 or 21 when I found my way to
his Writers Forum Experimental Workshop, then held at the Poetry Society.  I knew immediately I&#8217;d met a kindred
spirit.  When I lived in London we
worked a lot together on books, and to a lesser extent, in performances. ). His
radically inventive creative spirit, generosity and openness was
staggering.  He was without limits. </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">I made a small IMPROVIsation as tribute for him which Bill 
  Griffiths put up on his own website <a
href="http://www.indigogroup.co.uk/llpp/tributes.html">http://www.indigogroup.co.uk/llpp/tributes.html</a> at Bob&#8217;s death: </p>

<P class="doublespace">

<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.:</b> You are responsible for editing one of
the most important anthologies of innovative writing by women (<i>Out of
Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women, </i>London: Reality
Street Editions, 1996)<sup><a href="#7">7</a><a name="7b"></a></sup> that has emerged in recent years.  How did you go about gathering and deciding
on this material? What kind of correspondences did you find between the British
and the American writers?</p>

<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.:</b> I did a reading tour in the US and
Canada in autumn 1993 which exposed me to a lot that was going on there and I
went about gathering and deciding the material using the input from that trip
as well as drawing upon the work of poets who had inspired my own
practice.  I drew up initial lists with
Ken/Wendy (Ken Edwards, Wendy Mulford of Reality Street Editions).  We pretty much agreed on core
contributors.  I was keen for a large US
representation, for younger Canadian poets, whose work I&#8217;d encountered in
Canada as well as a preference for poets working in multi-media off-the-page
performance work. Originally, the book was planned to have twenty contributors
with about five pages each, but it was soon obvious that it would have to be
upped to thirty to have meaning. Even within the scope of thirty, I had to omit
poets whose work was important.  </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">Obviously, I found correspondences between the engagement
with formally progressive language practices, the range of visual and
linguistic attentions, the engagement with cultural, social and philosophical
perspectives, as well as the engagement with long poetic sequences and project-orientated
work, embracing inter and multi-media work and performance practises.  And also, the fact that a  good many of them found themselves excluded
from canonical anthologies of women&#8217;s poetry. 
</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.: </b>Writing about <i>Out of Everywhere</i> a
number of commentators, including Ann Vickery, Marjorie Perloff and Kathleeen
Fraser, have commented on the visual nature of many of the pages. Ann Vickery
in particular observes that the anthology &#8220;maps work that visually challenges
reading habits&#8221; in its emphasis on &#8220;the politics of the page&#8221; (<i>Leaving Lines
of Gender, </i>Wesleyan UP, 2000, 144)<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>.<a name="8b"></a> She points out that
this is very much in contrast to the predominately left margined poetry of, for
example, Silliman&#8217;s anthology, <i>In The American Tree</i>.<sup><a href="#9">9</a><a name="9b"></a></sup> Was
this a feature, or a tension, which you were particularly wanting to foreground
when you were putting the anthology together? Do you feel that this attention
to the visual potential and possibilities of the page is something that has led
to the exclusion of some women writers from canonical anthologies?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.:</b>  By today&#8217;s standards I was
late in learning to &#8216;read&#8217;. Before this, I used to paint and draw and copy out
writing  &#8211; using whatever materials were
at hand, entranced.   I&#8217;ve always been
intoxicated with writing/drawing/painting &#8211; in essence, it all boils down to
mark making, exploding the visual, somatic potentials of the page.   There has never been a separation for me.
So, obviously, I wanted to draw attention to the multivalent physiques of
poetic practises by women when editing <i>Out of Everywhere</i>.  The general blindness towards actualising
the potentials and possibilities within poetic language  - of the page as a poetic site, as part of
poetic language - has always baffled me. Any poet, irrespective of gender, who
visually expands the possibilities of the page is excluded from canonical
anthologies &#8211; because fabricators of canons don&#8217;t want awkwardnesses.  </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">That&#8217;s why the work of Jerry Rothenberg and his
visionary assemblings have been such a sustaining force in my life.  </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.:</b> I have been looking over your 1993
collaboration with Bruce Andrews which is extraordinary in its scope.  Could you tell me how this collaboration
came about and how the process of writing the book worked?  Did you exchange pages by mail? Did you work
on specific themes or ideas? Procedures?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.:</b> I think the idea about doing a
collaborative piece was raised when Bruce did a <i>Sub-Voicive</i> reading in
London.  What we thought we&#8217;d do was to
read each other&#8217;s work and respond to the thematic, lexical and sonic, textural
tints in the languages until we each came up with about 3000 handwritten words
on tiny pieces of paper.  The small
pieces of paper was Bruce&#8217;s suggestion. We each held back half of these words
and sent the remaining half to the other person.  So overall we each had 3000 words to work with (this number being
composed of 1500 of one&#8217;s own input plus 1500 from the other person) &#8211;  divided these into 15 sections each.  So, we organised the work into 30 sections,
in three parts A, B and C, with five texts (of 2 pages) from each person for
each section. We did it all by mail. </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.:</b> Your recent work seems to have exploded
the confines of the line and the page in colourful and energetic new directions.
How do you account for this shift in your relationship to the shape of the
line, the word &#8211; and indeed the book? Is this fraught relationship between the
verbal and the visual something that emerged suddenly (for example in the rich
textual surfaces of <i>red shifts</i> (2001), or do you consider it to always
have been an issue in your work?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.: </b><i>murmur </i>has extended my searchings within the
sculptural, painterly, textural, sonic and aural in an immersioning of
multi-level verbal visual languages.</p>



<P>In &#8220;<i>all origins are lonely</i>&#8221; I am continuing my
multi-level dances and speculations within the sensual, bodily architectural
MATTER of poetry/poetics  </p>

<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.: </b>This<b> &#8220;</b>immersioning of multi-level
verbal visual languages&#8221; that you describe implies a process of absorption for
the reader as much as the writer in the space of the work?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.:</b> Since the beginning of <i>red shifts</i>,
I have been constructing my work on the wall.   So far, the A4 sized pages of <i>murmur </i>fills one and a half  walls of my workroom. When I walk through
the doorway of my workroom its energies enfold me.  I&#8217;d like it to be encountered in such a way, so that the viewer/perceiver/reader
could walk up to it and walk along beside it, stretching their body to its
uppermost height or stooping to its lowest edge, threading in and
out/unravelling its fields of languages, touching it with their eyes and ears
and body entering and leaving at any point. </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">My preoccupation with the poetic work as a multidimensional,
kinaesthetic, sentient terrain or environment for the body to enter and move
through, is a thread that runs through all my work over the past twenty years &#8211;  the seeds of these concerns were sown/sewn
in my work of the 1980&#8217;s &#8211; particularly in multi-coloured works such as <i>A
Natural History in 3 Incomplete Parts,</i> which I brought out from my own
Magenta press in 1985 when I lived in London and which Bob Cobbing and I made
together at his place &#8211; (we constructed the entire book going from xeroxing my
original pages, collating, binding, glueing, trimming the A5 pages, etc.
and  it took us a 5-day working week &#8211;
Monday &#8211; Friday - to do this &#8211; working intensively from 10 til 5 every day and
getting to grips with the brand-new binding. machine Bob had just bought!).
We&#8217;d planned to launch it on the Saturday, so it simply had to be done that
week!  </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.:</b> You recently performed the first section
of <i>murmur </i>at Birkbeck College in London and many of the people who saw
that performance commented on the way in which you moved among people, quite
deliberately laying out pieces of the text all around the room.<sup><a href="#12">12</a><a name="12b"></a> </sup>You
seemed to draw them into the poem itself...</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.:</b> The reading on the 6<sup>th</sup>
November was the first public presentation of <i>murmur </i>in its fullest
form, to date. </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">I cradled the seventy-page stack of specially enlarged
A3pages on my left arm.  I stood and
performed each page and then stooped to place it, face-up, on the floor.  I stepped forward and did the same again and
again for all the seventy pages.  I
weaved <i>murmur/murmur</i> weaved me over the floor space created by the
circle of seated people (many were sitting on the floor) until there were no
pages left on my cradling arm.  For the
&#8216;purpled madder&#8217; section I used a keening by Kittie Gallagher made in Gweedore,
County Donegal, 1952 &#8211; her lament, muffling out from the tiny cassette/recorder
in my jacket pocket as I moved among the pages around the floor.  </p>



<P class="HALFSPACE">This was one verbal installation of the work, specific to
that particular physical location, that situation.</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>D.O.: </b>Which implies that there might be other
possibilities for its performance and inhabition in other spaces. Might these
places be back in the landscape, or in other site-specific places-beyond the
usual confines of what where we expect to find poetry readings and
performances?</p>



<P class="HALFSPACE"><b>M.O.S.: 
</b>Yes, I
hope so. </p>
