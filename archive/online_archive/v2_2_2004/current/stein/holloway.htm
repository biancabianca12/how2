      <p><strong><em>Production Note </em></strong><em>: Part of the “Permit” project involves me performing improvised readings of “Permit” writings that have been printed out onto 52 A4 sheets and arranged in an unchanging 8 x 7 grid (with four ‘holes' for feet) which I then move around. When doing this, I sometimes read into a dictaphone. Later I transcribe these recorded readings but without stopping the tape, so not all the words get written down. Sometimes I transcribe the same reading more than once.</em></p>
