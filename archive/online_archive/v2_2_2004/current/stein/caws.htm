      </blockquote>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">The only time she hadn&#8217;t showed up before had 
        been on the Tuesday we call 9/11. I knew nothing of what had happened, 
        except that I was there waiting, and she wasn&#8217;t. There was then 
        a horde of persons walking uptown with ashen faces. The pallor all around. 
        Gradually the horror settled in then, with its details.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Because we had walked together more than a quarter 
        of a century, with a dog when she had one. The last had been called Bianca 
        (who would bound towards me in the park), and then Lucy (who preferred 
        squirrels). I grew to expect it always. Every Tuesday it was. At 11:30 
        exactly she would be there. No need to phone about it. It was just like 
        that.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">If it was windy, I would allow more time, not to 
        get delayed by the force pushing against me. If it was rainy, I would 
        wear my rainhat. If it was sunny, she would complain. She was always too 
        hot, never too cold. But never to be late, that was the point; she never 
        was.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">About hats. My black cotton one from Agnes B. she 
        loved, and so I got her one, size 58. Then I lost mine, and wanted to 
        borrow hers to have one made like it. No, she said, you will lose it, 
        my hat. And I guess I would have, since I had lost mine.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">So then last Tuesday we walked. And I went to the 
        sailboat lake after and had coffee and a cookie and was happy. Then trundled 
        my way home and rebegan to write. Can&#8217;t now remember exactly what. 
        The day after the day after that I met friends for breakfast, walked home, 
        and got the call about it. She had done herself in, my walking companion, 
        as she had predicted long before.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">It seemed too soon to all of us. Maybe it always 
        seems too soon.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">And then the talking started: should she have left 
        us notes, each of us her close friends? What kind of goingon would each 
        of us her family and close friends be doing from then on? What kind of 
        dreadful gap would this leave? No place in the mind had escaped this &#8212; 
        as if there were no longer an escaped place.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">When I had been desperate so long ago, her being 
        there every week had meant I would be there. This gave sense to my ordinary 
        chaos, put an anchor to my drifting. Must have been true for some others 
        too.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">What could have made her want to stay? Leave while 
        the party is still fun, she had said, that&#8217;s what I mean to do. 
        Was it still fun for her, or was it over already in her thinking? Now 
        for us someone will be missing, as well as the other someones anyway.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">And now the separation in the narrative, where lots 
        of things fit, not pleasing though, is also between Mary and Ann.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">But then I remember:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Never a name never a name surname a name a name never a name never 
          a name in time. (p. 268)
