      </blockquote>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">John Cage &#8212; like Gertrude Stein &#8212; like 
        any artist &#8212; provoked controversy. After an audience protested at 
        a performance of a musical work created using chance operations, Cage 
        targeted self-expression. The protest was self-expression and ugly, he 
        said, whereas the music lacked self-expression and was beautiful. I believe 
        him. I also think his statement beautiful (his acrostics beautiful, his 
        quotations beautiful).</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Beauty is the reader&#8217;s job.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Is it interesting?</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Beauty as aesthetic criteria has scraped its way 
        to the late twentieth century through being an effect of the mind.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Gertrude Stein &#8212; like John Cage &#8212; is 
        a cerebral artist, concerned with new reading possibilities, and humour. 
        Read me, you<em> can</em> read me, she is saying. She is not concerned 
        with emotion, reader&#8217;s emotions are not her business. Characters 
        and situations become structural rather than rhetorical effects: Stein 
        herself drew the analogy of her writing with Cubism. Her writing is beautiful 
        to the reader who experiences English as beautiful in itself, rather than 
        as a means of description, a crutch for imagination. A reader&#8217;s 
        imagination is not Stein&#8217;s business.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE"> Stein&#8217;s ambition is that of Shakespeare or 
        Whitman: to contain everything. <em>Her </em>everything is not historical 
        or social, but linguistic and geographical, that is, the present. Stein&#8217;s 
        oeuvre is an encyclopedic handbook of avant-garde writing. Her repetitions, 
        syntax, semantics, rhymes and rhythms are explosive ground. Stein&#8217;s 
        writing is closer (clover) to modern thinking than anyone before her in 
        English, and her writing creates a new thinking in her/my mind: language 
        is having its own adventure: the reader is invited, like an apostle, to 
        throw off ego and take a ride. She is closer to zen than to Sophocles 
        or Brecht. Now is happening now, and is happening again. Are you happy?</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Stein is an image machine: in her writing the image 
        has the inevitability of decor, it is post-symbolic and post-narrative. 
        Her flowers appear in rivers. This outrages readers who want their flowers 
        served on tea trays.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">What Stein offers is democratic writing that avoids 
        privileging character, description, plot or imagery. This avoidance of 
        the garden path is more radical &#8212; revolutionary &#8212; than the 
        marxist writings of the surrealists, for example, or Pasolini.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Stein is a bulwark; time.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Is this beautiful and who cares?</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">It&#8217;s as beautiful as reading, as neutrality 
        or freedom. A one woman revolution in prose with a brilliant girlfriend, 
        a succession of poodles and a smirk. I care.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><em>Postscript: Beauty Tactics for the Avant-Garde</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li>The punk, or ugly way: negate beauty as a bourgeois, reactionary trapping 
        which keeps the reader in a chair.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>The Auden, or futurist way: locate beauty in industry or progress 
            (discredited; has new possibilities with progress reconfigured as technology 
            or information).<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>The Breton or Pasolini way: inflame the reader with surreal/transgressive 
          examples of beauty.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>The Cage way: identify beauty in avant-garde work: beauty as idea.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>The Stein way: beauty becomes just another cord/chord in an ongoing 
          rope of music. It becomes the music. Beauty as what we have or choose.</li>
