      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Gertrude Stein famously stated that the United States 
        of America is the oldest country in the world, due to its having been 
        in the twentieth century the longest (<em>ABT</em> 86-87; <em>BW</em> 
        50). Henry James had a good deal to do with this state of affairs, in 
        literature and beyond, as Gertrude Stein came to see.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Both writers knew what it was to have each foot in 
        a different era. For James, it was the Victorian and the modern. Stein 
        had one foot in the modernist avant-garde and a toehold in what was to 
        become the postmodern. Stein recognized the difference in this similarity 
        with her illustrious compatriot, stating in <em>Picasso</em> (published 
        in 1938): &#8220;One must never forget that the reality of the twentieth 
        century is not the reality of the nineteenth century, not at all&#8221; 
        (<em>P</em> 21). The Victorian age was driven by steam, carried by railroads, 
        and showcased in crystal palaces; the modern age was illumined by electricity, 
        carried by powered flight, and anchored with reinforced concrete. James 
        began the process of breaking down the reality of the nineteenth century 
        novel &#8212; a tradition inherited from Turgenev, Zola, and George Eliot 
        &#8212; and he inherited the insurgent break into the new from Flaubert 
        and Maupassant. Stein&#8217;s heritage, when refracted (as it often is) 
        through <em>Three Lives</em>, discloses Flaubert, Cezanne, Matisse and 
        Picasso &#8212; a novelist and three painters &#8211; all of whom were 
        instrumental in radical restructurings of their art forms in the last 
        century.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">The dual role of inheritor and avatar, custodian 
        and insurgent, was definitive to James and Stein (and has proven to remain 
        so to their scholarly portraitists). Each were pivots of their ages, perfecting 
        their heritages and pushing into the frontier. But (as Pound asks elsewhere 
        of Whitman) is there a compact between them?</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Stein came to understand what it was she had inherited 
        from literary history in the new century and she came to know how to use 
        it, further it, and transform it. Her process of true literary understanding 
        is often said have begun when writing <em>The Making of Americans </em>(1903-09) 
        or <em>Three Lives</em> (1905-06). But how she used this knowledge was 
        instructive and new. Stein elected not to enlist a phalanx of literary 
        reference to do her thinking. An author or text might be used to substantiate 
        a point or to prove a case, but cannot stand in for the thinking that 
        motivates writing. Stein preferred to make a declarative statement and 
        have it delineate and stand on its own ground. In this she was a true 
        inheritor of American pragmatism and self-sufficiency. Thinking, observing, 
        writing, like three interlocking rings, establish continuously the locus 
        of Stein&#8217;s practice. This is where writing implies thinking about 
        and observing the act of writing in the act of writing. There are times 
        when thinking must be thinking about writers and their practices, and 
        in these moments Stein often thinks and writes about Henry James.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">A series of historical and biographical analogies 
        unite Henry James and Gertrude Stein. Ira Nadel has compiled a list of 
        several of these contact points: the formal, thematic, and narrative correspondences 
        between James&#8217;s <em>The Awkward Age</em> of 1899 and Stein&#8217;s 
        <em>Q. E. D.</em> of 1903 (83); the near-meeting between the two writers 
        in 1914 that failed to eventuate despite the intermedial efforts of Alvin 
        Langdon Coburn &#8212; the photographer who had earlier provided the frontispieces 
        for the New York Edition of James&#8217;s novels (84); the shared artistic 
        commitment to action (88); and James&#8217;s triumphal visit to the United 
        States in 1904 after decades of expatriate life, foreshadowing Stein&#8217;s 
        own triumphal visit in 1934 in the wake of the enormously successful <em>Autobiography 
        of Alice B. Toklas</em> (91). Many other critics have drawn attention 
        to the links, resemblances, and coincidences between the two writers.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Naturally Stein offers a first-hand account of her 
        relation to James, but in the sleight-of-hand narrative voice of Alice 
        B. Toklas. The narrator reveals that Stein did not read James &#8220;in 
        her formative period&#8221; (<em>ABT</em> 87) and only took him up much 
        later &#8212; a claim shown to be disingenuous by Nadel (91) and Caramello 
        (184). Stein does consider him &#8220;quite definitely as her forerunner, 
        he being the only nineteenth century writer who being an American felt 
        the method of the twentieth century&#8221; (<em>ABT </em>86). Toklas admits elsewhere 
        to her own lifelong fascination with James&#8217;s writing (Sprigge 81). 
        In any event a household congenial to Jamesian prose remains as good a 
        place as any in which to examine his true greatness and to explore what 
        it can do to its rightful inheritors. Stein came to this task in 1932 
        when she began drafting <em>Four in America</em> &#8212; the first long text she 
        composed after <em>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</em>. The text 
        was completed in 1933 but only published posthumously in 1947.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Stein sets out the premise of this text in its full 
        title &#8212; <em>Four in America: What They Thought and Bought</em> (the 
        subheading actually appears above the heading, putting visual and semantic 
        orders into an ambiguous relationship of continuous inversion) &#8212; 
        and in the four sentences that follow the heading:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ulysses 
          E. Grant had been a religious leader who was to become a saint what 
          would he have done.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Wright 
          brothers had been artists that is painters what would they have done.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Henry 
          James had been a general what would he have had to do.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If General 
          Washington had been a writer that is a novelist what would he do. (<em>FIA</em> 
          1)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">The three latter premises focus upon military and 
        aesthetic prowess, and share with the first the potential for hagiography. 
        The first and fourth premises frame the middle two using the hero (at 
        least for the Union states) of the Civil War and the hero of the Revolutionary 
        War: two events that propelled a newly industrialized America into the 
        twentieth century (<em>ABT</em> 87). The second premise combines the invention 
        of powered flight with the processes of cubism (if, as seems likely, Picasso 
        is the painter lurking in the shadows of history here), both truly modern 
        modes of relating to the world. Which leaves the third premise: what would 
        Henry James have had to do if he had been a general?</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">An effective general is required to assess, and to 
        alter if necessary, the approach into battle. A direct approach is only 
        effective within a particular range of conditions and against certain 
        adversaries. Stein approaches Henry James in an apparently oblique manner, 
        opening her ploy with the question: &#8220;What is the difference between 
        Shakespeare&#8217;s plays and Shakespeare&#8217;s sonnets&#8221; (<em>FIA</em> 
        119). As with the difference between an accident and a coincidence &#8212; 
        the former simply happens and the latter &#8220;is going to happen and 
        does&#8221; (119) &#8212; Shakespeare&#8217;s plays &#8220;were written 
        as they were written [&#8230;] Shakespeare&#8217;s sonnets were written 
        as they were going to be written&#8221; (120). That is, the plays are 
        emergent from the thinking that gives them life and the conditions in 
        which they are produced. They interact with their conditions and engage 
        in a reciprocal relation with those conditions. They are not prefabricated; 
        their shape is contingent upon the writing and is only known once the 
        writing is written. The sonnets do not emerge; they are crafted according 
        to demand, convention, and to what can be harmoniously incorporated into 
        them. They are of the marketplace and are, in the terms of Stein&#8217;s 
        surtitle, able to be &#8220;bought.&#8221;</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">What does this have to do with Gertrude Stein or 
        with Henry James? Gertrude Stein discovered the difference between Shakespeare&#8217;s 
        sonnets and Shakespeare&#8217;s plays by coincidence, that is, she made 
        the discovery by replicating its terms in her own writing: &#8220;The 
        coincidence is with Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship 
        Faded&#8221; (119). In this poem composed in 1930 &#8212; Stein&#8217;s 
        liberal translation of Georges Hugnet&#8217;s poem <em>Enfance</em> &#8212; the 
        translator and the poet in Stein converge and produce a literary work 
        that was written as it was written, and written as it was going to be 
        written. She had discovered that Shakespeare&#8217;s two kinds of writing 
        could be carried out simultaneously. If paraphrase is possible, Stein 
        writes a work that at once refers to a work it ostensibly translates, 
        refers to its process of translation, is aware of itself on its own terms, 
        and observes and codifies this process of reflexivity. This produced a 
        marvelous formal innovation in its compact efficiency and its reticulated 
        knowledge: an innovation made possible by the conditions of modernity 
        and the twentieth-century world.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">But again, what does this have to do with Henry James? 
        Much of the &#8220;Duet&#8221; &#8212; the first half of &#8220;Henry 
        James&#8221; in <em>Four In America</em> &#8212; is concerned with the 
        elaboration of Stein&#8217;s breakthrough and its relation to the writing 
        of Shakespeare. &#8220;Henry James nobody has forgotten Henry James even 
        if I have but I have not&#8221; (128). James too shows his stripes by 
        discovering how to write in the two ways at once. Stein comes to see that 
        James precedes her and shows her the way to write in this double way. 
        This makes him a general: he employs strategy (writing as it is going 
        to be written) and utilizes tactics necessary to a situation (writing 
        as it is written). James qualifies as a genius: his tactical nous and 
        strategic sense signify genius in literary terms as they signify the mind 
        of a general in military terms. James is a genius in another sense: he 
        employs his capabilities that are at hand. Like Stein after him James 
        does not need to rely upon a phalanx of literary reference but uses his 
        native intellect, his &#8220;genius&#8221; (<em>genius loci</em>, the 
        spirit of a place) to forge the craft of writing into new territory. It 
        is a space-creating genius.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">It would be tempting to read James, and Stein after 
        him, as exemplars of the American frontier &#8212; in this context the 
        frontier of time (modernity) and of literary space (two types of writing). 
        Stein qualifies this in &#8220;Duet,&#8221; asserting that: &#8220;Henry 
        James was an American, but not as a general as a general he was a European 
        as a general, which he was as he was a European general&#8221; (139). 
        He wrote from his context and his environment. His writing emerged from 
        these conditions, along with his consciousness of those conditions and 
        his consciousness of the process of writing from them. In the most obvious 
        and basic sense, then, Henry James could be said to be a European as a 
        general. He could hardly be anything else.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">But, Stein tells us, Henry James was three (139). 
        Who or what can these Jameses be? &#8220;Henry James is a combination 
        of the two ways of writing and that makes him a general a general who 
        does something. Listen to it&#8221; (137). Henry James is the two ways 
        of writing: he is a strategist and a tactician, both qualities of a general. 
        &#8220;Listen to it&#8221; &#8212; James has been transformed into a textual 
        entity. Henry James is an authorial effect (<em>avant </em>Michel Foucault), and 
        is the entity produced in the minds of his readers, including Gertrude 
        Stein. Henry James is the author she thinks of as a reader of his novels, 
        he is the author and general she writes about in <em>Four in America</em>, 
        and his name constitutes the title of this third section of her text. 
        Never mind the three Henry Jameses! Henry James is three in his own texts 
        and three in Gertrude Stein&#8217;s text. He is a true literary trinity 
        (the three in one) and its mirror image.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">&#8220;Henry James&#8221; in <em>Four in America</em> 
        reports and embodies the opening of a boundary into its own space: a space 
        still bounded by the regions it once divided. It is the space opened when 
        referentiality and reflexivity are coexistent and coextensive, and when 
        these two modes are apprehended in the process of composition by the process 
        of composition. From a dyad emerges a triad &#8212; the new form of composition 
        Stein grasps from Henry James&#8217;s two kinds of writing. Stein&#8217;s 
        writing includes &#8220;a subject, Stein&#8217;s reflexive treatment of 
        it, and Stein&#8217;s meditation on that treatment&#8221; (Caramello 183). 
        Stein registers a debt to James for opening this avenue to writers of 
        the twentieth century with the keen vision to put it into practice (i.e. 
        Stein herself). She might not have reached that point without him, but 
        equally, she (and we) could not read the two ways of writing in Henry 
        James without her observations of that phenomenon. Stein recirculates 
        literary influence upon James and enfolds his texts within her field of 
        writing.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Stein&#8217;s oeuvre embodies a sustained commitment 
        to a radical thinking-through of her literary stylistics. Her meditations 
        on language are implicit in the scene of her literary writing. Elsewhere 
        her meditations are public and declamatory: <em>Composition as Explanation</em> 
        (1926), <em>How To Write</em> (1931), <em>Lectures in America</em> (1935), 
        and <em>Narration</em> (1935). As singular as her writing may first appear 
        to be, Stein was a writer of her time. Her narrative and lyrical experiments 
        bear aesthetic affinities with several great minimalists of her era and 
        the next: Samuel Beckett in theatre and prose, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe 
        in architecture, and John Cage in music. Indeed the great themes of Stein&#8217;s 
        composition practices have become some of the more abiding preoccupations 
        of the arts in the twentieth century: repetition and modulation, sameness 
        and similarity, identity and multiplicity, and seriality and sequentiality. 
        Her legacy is not constrained to the arts &#8212; the Anglo-American struggle 
        with and adaptation of (mainly French and German) postmodern philosophy 
        and poststructuralist literary theory also contemplate these dyads with 
        disarming frequency and intensity.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">An attempt to register the magnitude of Stein&#8217;s 
        radical break with realist narrative techniques, with the novel form, 
        and with conventions of portraiture in <em>Four in America</em> might compare the 
        structure of her break with that of another radical thinker at another 
        point of singularity. In his first book, <em>Edmund 
        Husserl&#8217;s </em>Origins of Geometry<em>: <em>An Introduction </em>,</em> Jacques Derrida attempts 
        to grasp the full implications of Husserl&#8217;s phenomenology. The processes 
        of phenomenology, its relation to history and to the event, and its preoccupation 
        with the different forms of reduction, all signify an essentializing sense 
        of the singularity. Derrida &#8212; before deconstruction and before grammatology 
        &#8212; applies phenomenology to the Idea itself: &#8220;That a phenomenological 
        determination of the Idea itself may be radically impossible from then 
        on signifies perhaps that phenomenology cannot be reflected in a phenomenology 
        of phenomenology, and that its <em>Logos</em> can never appear as such&#8221; 
        (141). The Idea, when put under scrutiny by a process of contemplation 
        and perception, reveals and constitutes the singular point of fallacy 
        in the process itself. It opens a region that we now know as the region 
        of deconstruction, but it is crucial to remember that the origins of that 
        region are to be found in Husserl as read by Derrida. The significance 
        of this moment in an early Derridean text can hardly be overstated. It 
        employs precisely the structure Stein employs in her reading of Henry 
        James, and her writing of &#8220;Henry James.&#8221; Both Stein and Derrida 
        articulate a double process of referentiality and reflexivity, and in 
        charting the writing of this double process, they instigate a redefinition 
        of the field (the three-fold method of writing; the impossible Idea of 
        phenomenology) and a process of openness and continuing critique. Derrida 
        becomes a general: one who understands the need to employ strategy, and 
        to produce tactics when met with the unaccounted amid the action of thought. 
        Gertrude Stein is often blessed (and blasted) as an avatar of poststructuralism. 
        Here she can be seen to have anticipated and inscribed its structure into 
        her own poetics.</p>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">Gertrude Stein saw what was truly innovative in Henry 
        James. She wrote about it and took it up and developed it in her own writing 
        practices. She was not touching up a Jamesian aesthetic, nor was she polishing 
        off what the master and genius had left unfinished. Instead she anticipated 
        him, met him, and resolved him in her own way. Writing about a different 
        kind of chronological anticipation (in this case of poststructuralist 
        theory), Shirley Neuman and Ira B. Nadel consider the experience of <em>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</em>, <em>d&eacute;j&agrave; lu</em> in reading Stein: the recognition that &#8220;Stein 
        did that!&#8221; (xx) Stein did the Jamesian sentence, the Jamesian paragraph, 
        and Jamesian writing, that is, writing what one is writing and writing 
        what one is going to be writing at the same time. Not merely did she do 
        that: she did that until it was done, opening the space of writing to 
        be reconfigured on each reading.</p>
