          <div class=Section1>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lola Ridge’s <i>The Ghetto and Other Poems,</i> 
              for which she won critical acclaim in 1918, remains largely forgotten 
              save the scanty criticism available at Cary Nelson’s MAPS website 
              and Nancy Berke’s book, <i>Women on the Left</i>. These poems, out 
              of print but now available through Al Filreis’ English 88 site as 
              well as through Project Gutenberg, reveal a space where the beautiful 
              meets the grotesque — describing poverty with a plush, Casino-like 
              landscape yet not devoid of the decay and decrepit surfaces within. 
              The first poem in the collection, which appears just before “The 
              Ghetto,” her long title poem, addresses the American people directly, 
              inviting them to share “…bitter apples / And honey served on thorns.” 
              This dichotomy between nourishment and the distasteful nature inherent 
              in partaking of such nourishment prefigures for the entire volume, 
              which repeatedly confronts the city, the laborer, and the immigrant 
              to reveal a complex portrait contingent upon degrees of individuality 
              and community.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “The Ghetto,” Ridge presents a neighborhood 
              of leftovers lit by “…the waste light of stars, /.” Whitmanian in 
              her address, it is the leftovers that Ridge considers most carefully 
              — waste becomes fertilizer for her language and her narrative: a 
              house full of immigrants living on Hester Street. Alongside the 
              trash of the ghetto — “…colors decomposing, / Faded like old hair— 
              ” exist the rich images of, “Coral beads, blue beads, / Beads of 
              pearl and amber, / Gewgaws, beauty pins— /Bijoutry for chits —.”  
              As the poem progresses, it becomes apparent the ghetto is a place 
              that is compromised in terms of space and time: time for work and 
              space to live. Of time to work, the speaker notes the character 
              Sadie, “It is droll that she should work in a pants factory. / — 
              Yet where else…” And of space to live, the speaker describes, “…the 
              little babies — / Shiny black-eyed babies — (half a million pink 
              toes / Wriggling altogether.)” The longish lines and dense metaphor 
              portray a speaker who at times is overwhelmed by her surroundings 
              but also comforted by the density of the crowds, “…Bulging like 
              a crazy quilt / Stretched on a line.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Three separate sections, the first of which 
              is entitled “Manhattan Lights,” follow “The Ghetto.” This section 
              also works to explore the definitions of a city presenting the almost 
              imperceptible circles and arcs in the landscape of Broadway that 
              begins to convey a larger cycle, a rhythm of people surging with 
              and against New York City. This cycle is the dissipation of poverty 
              into affluence and affluence into poverty and is evident in the 
              way she describes the dime store, “Diaphanous gold, / Veiling the 
              Woolworth, argently /.” </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Ridge’s imagery and metaphor often suggest 
              simultaneity of events: the overlapping rhythms of the city and 
              its people, a community’s values at the site of exchange. However, 
              these images coupled with vibrant verbs like, “billowing, bursting, 
              glistening, spraying, dangling” sometimes produce redundant rhythms 
              and sentence constructions. These chants are contrasted by spare 
              and unexpected phrases. Lines like “A little old woman, / With a 
              wig of smooth black hair / Gummed about her shrunken brows, /”offset 
              the heavy verb catalogs by providing a contrasting rhythm, diction, 
              and tone.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The penultimate section of the book, “Labor,” 
              juxtaposes the imagery of manual labor — “Clangor of iron smashing 
              on iron, /” — against that of religion. In the short poem entitled, 
              “Spires,” the speaker calls into question whether Christ or merely 
              a building is being resurrected: “Aborting their own dreams / Till 
              the dream of you arose — / Beautiful, swaddled in stone— /.”  Several 
              other poems in this section weigh labor and religion against each 
              other in order to redefine that which the individual and the community 
              is willing and able to worship. These poems struggle with the symbolism 
              of a tradition, a heritage left behind, and the necessity to rework 
              that tradition in a new context in order to survive. The section 
              also explores new technology in the face of nature’s cycles and 
              the impact of this technology on man harkening to Langston Hughes’ 
              famous dream deferred. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The last section,  “Accidentals,” is comprised 
              of songs, toasts, and hopes for the land of Palestine, the tower 
              of Babel, to America, to the worker, and to the work. Poems in this 
              section consist of some of the most abstract titles in the book, 
              “Dreams,” “A Memory,” “Fire.” Whereas in the previous sections of 
              the book Ridge’s language focuses on tightly wound metaphor, here 
              her poems take up more formal constructions including rhyme scheme. 
              Ridge evokes Greek mythology, compares Cleopatra to a fat woman, 
              and reinvents the nursery rhymes “Jack and Jill” and “Rock a Bye 
              Baby” in a modern context. Ridge’s recycled repertoire of nursery 
              rhymes demonstrate perhaps in the most concrete terms of the section, 
              the speaker’s hope wound around youth, feminine knowledge, inquiry, 
              creation, and revision. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This book becomes a knitting together of several 
              poetic, political, and spiritual cosmologies to make a new space 
              for the voice of the disenfranchised. Ridge’s ability to make the 
              dividing line between the beautiful and the rank less perceptible 
              by varying degrees is the book’s strength, and is the reason she 
              is able to refigure the topics she tackles as well as her own poetics.  
              Nancy Berke’s assessment of Ridge describes a poet who, “was either 
              bitterly disparaged or lavishly praised by her contemporaries for 
              using poetry for public advocacy” (35).  Indeed, it is evident here 
              that <i>The Ghetto and Other Poems</i> is both art and advocacy 
              and neither. Rather, it is a book that is wedged between these two 
              categories historically seen as polar opposites. While worthy of 
              praise and recognition, it is no wonder a book of this caliber has 
              been lost in the recesses of Modernism. For it is the antithesis 
              of <i>l’art pour l’art</i> that this book seeks, calls into question, 
              and ultimately defies.</p>
