      <P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="CENTER">Genevieve Taggard As a <br>
        Rediscovered Modernist: <br>
        Some Introductory Comments</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">by Julia Lisella</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2">&nbsp;</P>
      
            
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The essays printed here represent a variety of contemporary 
        responses to the work of Genevieve Taggard (1894-1948), and address in 
        very direct and pragmatic ways the work of resuscitating and locating 
        modernist women’s careers.  While Taggard found T. S. Eliot’s version 
        of modernism misanthropic and hopeless, her own version of modernist poetics 
        traversed a difficult field between Marxism and experimentation. Much 
        of Taggard’s poetry might best be described as “social vision verse” with 
        a generous sampling of private, emotionally wrought lyric in between. 
        But several of the essays here attest to the fact that it is not only 
        impossible but rarely useful to categorize Taggard’s attempts as either 
        public and political or private lyric. Both impulses in Taggard’s poetry 
        moved together to produce a strong body of work that is worth reexamining 
        in light of the changing definitions of modernism and the scope of thought 
        on public political poetry today. Through some fortunate act of serendipity 
        rather than through some extra-ordinary precision of my editorship, the 
        writers here speak to each other in startlingly compatible and companionable 
        ways. Two essays, one by Nancy Berke, and the other by myself, are close 
        readings of individual poems. Our readings form a larger conversation 
        about the ways in which feminist ideas sought a place in Taggard’s poetry 
        at a time when class concerns may have seemed more urgent to Taggard and 
        to the American left in general.  Catherine Daly and Alison Van Nyhuis 
        contribute essays that attend to the forms in which we meet Taggard’s 
        work today. Daly extends her review of placing out-of-print public domain 
        texts on the web that she began with a discussion of Lola Ridge’s poems 
        in the previous issue of <i>How2</i>. She describes the insights that 
        take place when one scans, edits, and prepares a work of poetry for the 
        web. Daly also contributes two reviews of early books by Taggard that 
        underscore Taggard’s interest in global connections. Van Nyhuis’s essay 
        discusses the ways in which Taggard’s interest in both public and private 
        utterance has created a puzzle for anthology editors, but Van Nyhuis suggests 
        it’s a challenge that should be met to give credence to a poet’s own constructed 
        narrative of his or her work.</p>
            
      <p>&nbsp;</p><P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><strong>Bio: Julia Lisella </strong>is a poet and 
        a Lecturer on History and Literature at Harvard University. Her first 
        contribution to <i>How2</i> was a review of Lola Ridge’s book, <i>Firehead 
        </i>(1929), in the previous issue’s Readings Section. She is currently 
        working on a book about modernism and maternity based on her dissertation, 
        which featured a chapter on Genevieve Taggard. Her poems appear in such 
        journals as <i>Pleiades</i> and <i>Crab Orchard Review</i> and her book 
        reviews appear in such publications as <i>The Women’s Review of Books 
        </i>and <i>The Italian American Review. </i>She helps edit the online 
        journal, <i>The Mystic River Review.</i></P>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Investigation of the poetics/politics of intentionality 
          may be considered as a significant element of this section, as well 
          as questions of canon formation, public access, the reviewing process, 
          etc. These writings may be original or reprinted (by permission), and 
          will include conference papers relevant to the HOW2 project. Reflections 
          on the poem-making process are encouraged, as well as more formal essays. 
          Bios and photos are always requested; when they don't appear, it is 
          at the discretion of the writer. </P>
