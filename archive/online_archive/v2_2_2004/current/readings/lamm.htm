      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“<i>Later I played under highway bridges to make 
        room for strangers. A smell of concrete and mud, acrid of sexual transactions” 
        </i>declares the imaginary voice of a young Native American woman in Rosmarie 
        Waldrop’s <i>A Key into the Language of America </i>(1994). This voice 
        speaks from within a transaction that exchanges her body and image for 
        an abstract and sexualized sign, which in turn propels and justifies the 
        strangers’ encroachment. This voice, central to Waldrop’s text, traverses 
        the territories of thought held in place by time and the language of historical 
        documents; her voice makes the metaphors that sustained the feminization 
        and colonization of Native American culture and land literal. Her voice 
        employs dense language replete with ironies and metaphors to describe, 
        enact, and resist the experience of being forced to signify the receding 
        edge of language, culture, and landscape while being simultaneously bereft 
        of personhood’s visible signs. “<i>On the periphery of more private weather, 
        I tried to adjust to Dutch trumpets and <b>fire instead of bedclothes. 
        </b>This was inevitable if I wanted to imitate consciousness” </i>(8). 
        This passage suggests that consciousness, crucial to a definition of personhood 
        and the experience of subjectivity, must be imitated by spaces flanked 
        by signs of triumph and destruction. </P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A poetic <i>text a cléf</i>, Waldrop’s <i>A Key into 
        the Language of America </i>improvises from within and extends the critique 
        begun in Roger Williams’ treatise <i>A Key into the Language of America</i> 
        (1643). Williams was a Puritan ousted from the Massachusetts Bay Colony 
        for his “non-conformist opinions” and founded a “haven of religious freedom” 
        in what is now known as Rhode Island (xiii). He wrote <i>A Key into the 
        Language of America</i> as a study of the Narragansett’s language to enable 
        communication between the Puritans and the Narragansett Indians, but <i>A 
        Key</i> became more than a dictionary or a guide. It became a challenge 
        to his fellow Puritans to question their colonial perspective. As Waldrop 
        explains, “Williams recognized a culture where his compatriots saw only 
        savage otherness” (xiv). Williams’ fellow Puritans read <i>A Key </i>against 
        the author’s intentions; for them, it was evidence of his colonial success. 
        Waldrop continues, “<i>The Key </i>is written for them, for his compatriots 
        — who immediately misunderstood its intention. They regarded it as a factual 
        handbook, of great practical use to traders, missionaries, and settlers” 
        (xv). Opposing these justifying conclusions, Waldrop clarifies Williams’s 
        intent: “the original book was not written as a handbook for successful 
        colonization. It was written not only to teach a language, but also to 
        teach a lesson” (xvi). Williams’ lesson was, according to Waldrop, “moral 
        and spiritual. It was also political” (xvii). <i>A Key into the Language 
        of America </i>is a plea to Puritans to question their assumptions of 
        superiority and civility. In one of the poems Waldrop cites, Williams 
        asks,</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>If Nature’s Sons both <i>wild </i>and <i>tame,<br>
          </i>Humane and Courteous be:<br>
          How ill becomes it Sonnes of God<br>
          To want Humanity? (xvi)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop writes another <i>Key into the Language of 
        America</i> with “a politics of desire that questions all situations” 
        (Deleuze and Guattari, 1986, 42), and brings to the foreground what was 
        buried within, and essential to, the Puritan conceptualization of the 
        world they encountered in America. That is, Waldrop foregrounds how the 
        sign of the feminine contributes to the conflation of Native American 
        culture and the natural landscape. As a result of this conflation, the 
        daughters’ right to the humanity of personhood wasn’t considered, though 
        women were forced to signify both the “wild” and “tame,” the binaries 
        that emerge from the Puritan assumption that Native-Americans are synonymous 
        with nature. From within the structure and language of Williams’ document, 
        Waldrop calls attention to the formulation of the feminine as the definition, 
        limit, and excess of a repressive and civilizing order. Waldrop reveals 
        the fetishization of the feminine within American colonialism. She exposes 
        the simultaneous disavowal and recognition of the feminine, and the paradox 
        that women are only granted limited forms of recognition within the cultural 
        syntax of their disavowal. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I want to analyze the feminist critique central to 
        Waldrop’s <i>A Key into the Language of America</i>, and underscore its 
        place in what Sianne Ngai describes as “a general shifting in feminist 
        criticism from the terrain of speculative theory to more locally grounded 
        and historically based arenas of inquiry,” a shifting that has had “a 
        much more lingering impact on feminists from the literary avant-garde” 
        (17). <i>A Key into the Language of America </i>implicitly argues that 
        the strategies and dismantlings associated with contemporary literary 
        theory and avant-garde poetics are pertinent to contemporary writers’ 
        inquiries into history, particularly the gendered dimensions of history. 
        And despite the fact that their “lines of escape tend to be open to privileged 
        male figures” (Polan xxiii), this essay also begins to open the possibility 
        of utilizing Giles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s concept of minor literature 
        to analyze contemporary American avant-garde writing such as Waldrop’s. 
        <i>A Key into the Language of America </i>is, simultaneously, an enactment 
        and critique of minor literature, though it seems Waldrop would agree 
        with Deleuze’s portrayal of Anglo-American English as a dynamic field, 
        compelling for its play of power and subversion. In a dialogue written 
        with Claire Parnet, entitled “On the Superiority of Anglo-American Literature” 
        (1977) Deleuze claims that English is “a hegemonic, imperialistic language. 
        But for this reason it is all the more vulnerable to the subterranean 
        workings of languages and dialects which undermine it from all sides and 
        impose up it a play of vast corruptions and variations” (58). <i>A Key 
        into the Language of America</i> works within the shifting ground of power 
        of American English, but also attests to the vast and violent limits placed 
        on its subversion. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lynn Keller has recently argued that “a paradoxical 
        attraction at once to system and to deviancy” is fundamental to Waldrop’s 
        work (103). Following this formulation, it becomes easier to see how Waldrop’s 
        work exposes the paradoxes of a language that Deleuze and Parnet hail 
        as both hegemonic and riven with vulnerabilities by working within the 
        system of Williams’ formulations. In her prefatory remarks to her <i>A 
        Key into the Language of America</i>, entitled “A Key into a Key,” Waldrop 
        describes what her book borrows from Williams’s: “<i>A Key into the Language 
        of America </i>takes its title, chapter sequence, and many quotations 
        from Roger Williams’s book of the same title” (xii). The phrases Waldrop 
        borrows from Williams appear in bold; they figure as shards of a historical 
        perspective embedded in the landscape of American thought, which Waldrop 
        imitates in order to subvert. And yet, Waldrop does more than imitate 
        Williams’s language and structure; she tropes within them, breaking open 
        the form of his ideas. She expands the lesson Williams wanted to teach 
        his fellow Puritans into a more explicit argument, though interestingly, 
        Waldrop’s argument is textually more ambivalent. She also expands Williams’ 
        lessons into a feminist critique. Through the disembodied voice of “a 
        young woman ambivalent about her sex and position among the conquerors” 
        (xxiii), Waldrop calls attention to the imaginary and symbolic function 
        of woman within an equation that feminizes the conquered (xx). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The feminine was the repressed but crucially sustaining 
        sign in the colonization of America. As Waldrop writes, “In the shell 
        game of archetypes, the conquered (people or land) is always female…The 
        colonization of America put the very ‘male’ Indian position of the conquered 
        female, part of the land that was considered there to be taken” (xx). 
        The voice of the young woman attempts to represent the difficult experience 
        of living within this “shell game of archetypes” in which the signifier 
        through which she is supposed to identify herself is repeatedly used as 
        an ideological pass that justifies continued domination. Evocative and 
        dense, “her” passages resist complete understanding, and therefore are 
        poised to undo the understanding that Williams sought to inspire and, 
        more importantly, the understandings his Puritan readers thought they 
        brought to and gained from his text. To that end, this voice of the young 
        woman does not index a person exactly, but rather, a gendered subject 
        position that exists between the seams of national, cultural, and linguistic 
        identity. Waldrop restages the cultural clash between the Narragansetts 
        and the Puritans, but then allows the openings that emerge from the clash 
        to expose what and whom operated as the sign — “the voice” — of passivity. 
        This young woman’s voice represents but resists a gendered passivity; 
        she is a subject denied a subject “position,” a subject denied its own 
        relation to the imaginary, and continually displaced. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Analyzing the unpredictability of <i>A Key into the 
        Language of America</i>, its play between order and disorder, Keller argues, 
        “because the volume is so regular in its structure, [Waldrop’s] variations 
        are notable and heighten readers’ awareness of the multiple strands forming 
        any web of linguistic linkages or of cultural conflict” (108). Irony contributes 
        to readers’ heightened awareness of how the feminine helped sustain the 
        multiple strands forming the linguistic linkages and cultural conflicts 
        that mark early American history and literature. Waldrop deploys irony 
        to disentangle the orders of thought and perspective that Williams’ text 
        provides. In her essay “Irony and Postmodern Poetry,” Rae Armantrout delineates 
        how irony functions in a contemporary poet’s work. She states that irony 
        “marks the consciousness of dissonance” and is “the stubborn mark of the 
        divided psyche” (674). Irony’s capacity to represent the dual aspects 
        of a dissonant and divided perspective also becomes a way to “stage a 
        ‘return of the repressed,’ representing both the mechanism of repression 
        and the nature of repressed desire” (679). This is precisely what Waldrop 
        does when the young woman’s voice states: “<i>Too long I took clockwork 
        as a model instead of following the angle my inclinations make with the 
        ground” </i>(18). This statement is representative of the Native American 
        woman’s continually bewildered consciousness. It represents women finding 
        themselves emerging within forms of consciousness and selfhood that they 
        can only retrospectively resist, and attests to the thoroughness and pervasiveness 
        of Puritan colonization. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Furthermore, Waldrop inscribes what Williams’s audience 
        might have read from within his sentences and gives the lines the dissonance 
        of irony. In Chapter II, entitled “Of Eating and Entertainment,” Waldrop 
        links a description of the Narragansett’s meals and the language — as 
        well as the ideas — they were forced to figuratively take into their mouths. 
        Making the literal and the figurative equivalent on the surface of the 
        text allows Waldrop’s insight — that the Puritan eye ravenously roved 
        the landscape — to emerge. Waldrop represents the “mechanism of repression,” 
        as well as the ravenous nature propelling that desire: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Indiane corne,</b> boiled with free will and predestination is a 
          dish <b>exceeding </b><b>wholesome if</b> taken through the mouth. Their 
          words, too, fit to eat. And crow. A mark “cadency.” Similarly, an eye 
          devouring its native region must devote special attention to its dialect. 
          (5)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'>The line that begins 
        with a devouring eye articulates how Williams’s compatriots misread his 
        text. Williams transcribed and translated the Narragansett language in 
        order to facilitate equity and understanding between cultures, not a devouring 
        colonization. Waldrop’s work reveals the misreading that sustained the 
        repression and decimation of Native American culture and language.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The first chapter, entitled “Salutations,” is an 
        imitation of Williams’ delineation of the Narragansett’s sign system for 
        greeting, which turns, quite quickly, into the introduction of the language, 
        and then turns, quite quickly, into an assessment of the natural resources 
        available to the Puritans — “the pumice found in great quantities.” Waldrop 
        unravels the concatenation of assumptions that informed Puritan misreadings. 
        The Narragansett “Salutations,” Waldrop writes, “<b>Are of two sorts </b>and 
        come immediately before the body. The pronunciation varies according to 
        the point where the tongue makes contact with pumice found in great quantity” 
        (3). The voice of the young woman emerges from this description, announcing 
        her continual displacement within the receding space of Native American 
        marginalization: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><i>I was born in a town on the other side 
          which didn’t want me in so many</i>. <i>All the streets were long and 
          led. In the center, a single person had no </i><i>house or friends to 
          <b>allay excessive sorrowe</b></i>. <i>I, like other girls, forgot </i><i>my 
          name in the noise of traffic, opening my arms more to measure </i><i>their 
          extension than to offer embrace. </i>(4)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'>Rendered anonymous and 
        therefore rendered part of a paradoxically atomized collective — “<i>I, 
        like other girls, forgot my name” </i>— this voice offers up an ironic 
        imitation of a “salutation” as a means to measure and encompass women’s 
        dissipation within the fast traffic of American colonialization. Moreover, 
        the passage suggests that the feminine becomes the means through which 
        incursion is supposedly “welcomed” and measured. The woman embodies and 
        displaces this measurement simultaneously, as she “<i>open[s] [her] arms 
        more to measure their extension than to offer embrace.”</i> That is, she 
        makes the metaphorical equation that links her body, the land, and the 
        act of measurement, literal. <i> </i></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'>Waldrop follows this 
        declaration with a poem that elucidates the ideas informing and the consequences 
        that emerge from the Puritan assumption that learning the Narragansett 
        language will help facilitate economic expansion and the eradication of 
        Native Americans. Notice how “woman” is imagined as a facilitating passageway, 
        a metaphorical equation without the structure of metaphor, a noun used 
        as an adjective: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><b>the Courteous Pagan<br>
          </b>barefoot and yes<br>
          <b>his name laid down<br>
          </b><b>as dead<br>
          </b>one openness<br>
          one woman door<br>
          so slow in otherwise<br>
          so close </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Since she speaks from within a metaphorical equation 
        that does not explicitly call attention to itself as such — “one woman 
        door” — she calls attention to the ideas that sustain her marginalization. 
        The last two lines of the poem, “so slow in otherwise / so close,” suggest 
        how the feminization of Native American culture perpetuates and expedites 
        the rapidity of Puritan expansion. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Chapter VII, entitled “Of Their Persons and Parts 
        of Body,” begins by calling attention to language’s role in shaping the 
        perceptions of the Native American body: “Great bunch of <b>hayre </b>raked 
        from darkness, yet as organized a physical substance as <b>sober English</b>” 
        (15). The paragraph ends with an image of childbirth as the passageway 
        to religious submission: “Though childbirth will force Christianity down 
        the ladder into fighting units: women never forgive unparted flesh” (15). 
        If women resist the mandate to fulfill their biologically and socially 
        determined role, the Puritans are led to suppose that women will condemn 
        not only themselves, but “unparted flesh,” as though it is apart from 
        them. The young woman’s passage that follows these statements renders 
        a body and a psyche riven by violence: “<i>I was shorn of illusion and 
        impulse, though with a sorry knife, before touching amorous form</i>” 
        (16). Colonial violence precludes the possibility of love and sexuality. 
        The passage ends with two statements: one suggests but does not explicitly 
        represent the theft of rape, an enforced sexualization. The second attests 
        to the fact that stories have been left untold: “<i>All manner of man 
        and what bigness chased me to the bottom of my ignorance desolately sublimating 
        the fewness of wishes. Inexact report” </i>(16). That “<i>[a]ll manner 
        of man”</i> participated in this desolate sublimation, together with the 
        abstraction of “<i>bigness,” </i>suggests that it was not only white Puritans 
        who forced themselves on Native American women, but masculinity as a concept 
        and a force. The “<i>bigness,</i>” pervasiveness, and ubiquity of masculinity 
        makes an articulation of a story difficult, practically impossible, hence 
        the “<i>Inexact report” </i>(16). It is precisely the moments when Waldrop 
        makes the broken inexactness and vagueness of the history Williams’ text 
        transcribes into poetic ambiguity that the text most explicitly resists 
        the Puritan misreading of Williams’ text. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop is a German American woman writing in English 
        at the close of the twentieth-century. Her “report” of the sexed and gendered 
        story that Williams’s text does not tell is inevitably “inexact,” and 
        yet the voice she writes inscribes an awareness of gender and sexuality’s 
        symbolic role as the sustaining ground of the violent and uneven exchanges 
        that mark early American history. In one of the poetry sequences that 
        follow the young woman’s narrative sections, Waldrop writes, “the sexual 
        act takes on / a sheen of purchase / the difference of invasion” (52). 
        Transformed into an idea of physicality, nature, and sex — indeed, one 
        might say that she is forced to allegorizes them — the woman of <i>A Key 
        </i>is invisible to the eye, and is preoccupied by becoming and sustaining 
        a visibility that is outside the symbolism of cultural and monetary exchanges. 
        In Chapter XXIV, entitled “Concerning Their Coyne” Waldrop completes one 
        of Williams’ sentences to highlight the cultural imposition implicit within 
        the monetary sign system. “Songs of Myself” not only alludes to Walt Whitman’s 
        nineteenth-century poem, but a conception of American selfhood that the 
        Narragansetts unwittingly adopted through monetary exchange: “<b>Indians 
        are ignorant of Europe’s Coyne yet call it Monéash </b>and notice changes 
        in the price of beaver, somnambulism, and songs of myself” (49). The following 
        sentence points to the inequality built into these “exchanges.” The Narragansetts 
        brought their natural resources in exchange for their lives, and the Puritans 
        heard a cries of submission: “<b>They bring down all their sorts of furs 
        </b>and trade them for the wish to live, the wish to die, the wish to 
        kill, the wish to be had” (49) The young woman’s section that follows 
        highlights how the inequity of these exchanges dominate the imaginary 
        of self-perception: “<i>I learned that my face belonged to a covert system 
        of exchange since the mirror showed me a landscape requiring diffidence, 
        and only in nightmares could I find identity or denouement” </i>(50). 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In each chapter, the young woman confronts the realization 
        that what she sees of herself cannot be “mirrored” in culture. To transcribe 
        the difficulty of finding an identity outside of nightmares, in other 
        words, outside of a cultural unconscious, this voice is written under 
        the sign of search. Recall in the first chapter entitled “Salutations,” 
        the young woman states: “<i>I, like other girls, forgot my name in the 
        noise of traffic, opening my arms more to measure their extension than 
        to offer embrace” </i>(4). The attempt to see her arms, her physicality, 
        herself, “measured,” which might prove her actuality, seems to be inspired 
        by her name slipping from memory — a name readers never read or hear. 
        Another chapter of <i>A Key </i>articulates the stark binaries of space 
        she is forced to choose between in order to be seen. Cleverly, Waldrop 
        links the binaries of this choice to language by alluding to the phrase 
        “Sticks and stones will break my bones” at the opening of the passage: 
        “<i>Sticks and stones and swamps and howling wilderness, or inside a patient 
        garden and ability to behave: intrepid waiting. Sad career. Crisp choice” 
        </i>(24). The sentences that follow these lines are interesting not only 
        because the speaker adopts the myth of biological essentialism to explain 
        her own rebellion but because her description of the movement her desire 
        propels is infected by the language, ideals, and condemnations internal 
        to manifest destiny: “<i>Because of my uterine heritage an inner heat 
        pushed my knees toward desire and superhuman effort at the risk of getting 
        lost and needing <b>the succor of savages</b></i><b>” </b>(24). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The possibility of possessing an actuality consistently 
        propels this young woman’s search. Although her body figures for the landscape, 
        the stability of place is denied to her. Her voice hovers both before 
        and after conquest; she never finds or inscribes the “center” of the story, 
        but its traumatic outlines and peripheries. This is not to say that the 
        voice is mythical. Waldrop manages to render simultaneously a particular 
        and collective consciousness and intelligence, but when she takes action 
        to place her intelligence within the visible and recognizable of the social 
        symbolic, she becomes all the more amorphous, abstract, absent. In Chapter 
        IV, she describes the rituals and collective ecstasies of baptism: “<i>A 
        procession, a river of people, the whole town crossed into exaltation 
        to subject the body to their rites of candle and flame, cries and bewailing, 
        morning and evening.” </i>The young woman doesn’t resist, and more importantly, 
        doesn’t want to resist, the pull that will “subject the body to their 
        rites.” In other words, these “rites” — which play off “rights” — make 
        the body into a subject, granting it subjectivity.<i> </i>She poses the 
        impossibility of resisting as a rhetorical question: “<i>Could I withdraw 
        from such offering. I rushed my headlong into it and found I made no splash. 
        It would take a different kind of water to quench my long terror”</i>(14).  
        The visual and physical outlines of this self will not materialize in 
        cultural waters that refuse to mirror a woman’s actuality and presence. 
        The fact that readers never see her and never know her name attests to 
        not only the resistance a young Native American woman must have encountered 
        if she attempted to forge a place in the symbolic order; it also attests 
        to the limits to representation language, culture, and time imposes upon 
        Waldrop as a writer. <i>A Key into the Language of America</i> is an imaginary 
        testimony to what might have been said by a woman speaking within and 
        against the dominance of a major language and culture.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>A Key into the Language of America</i> is the 
        work of a sensibility attuned to the power within language as it aligns 
        the borders of cultural and literary documents and reinforces the seams 
        of identity and personhood. This sensibility emerges out of, but is not 
        halted by, Waldrop’s sustained attention to a unique constellation of 
        positions that together compose her history. Born in 1935, Waldrop is 
        a woman poet of German descent. Her childhood coincided with the rise 
        of Nazism, and she now lives in the United States, speaking and writing 
        in English. In the preface to <i>A Key into the Language of America, </i>Waldrop 
        weighs parts of her history and identity on the power scale now required 
        of contemporary consciousness: “I was born ‘on the other side,’ in Germany. 
        Which was then Nazi Germany. I am not Jewish. I was born on the side of 
        the (then) winners” (xix). She goes on to weigh her gender identity and 
        vocation: “I am white and educated. I am also a poet and a woman. A poet, 
        in our days, is regarded as rather a marginal member of society, whose 
        social usefulness is in doubt. As a woman, I do not figure in the shell 
        game of archetypes, but as conquered” (xx). Furthermore, as a result of 
        her linguistic and geographical displacement, naturalized equations between 
        language and identity are permanently unsettled. In her essay “Thinking 
        as Follows” Waldrop writes, “In crossing the Atlantic my phonemes settled 
        somewhere between German and English. I speak either language with an 
        accent. This has saved me the illusion of being the master of language. 
        I entered it at a skewed angle, through the fissures, the slight difference” 
        (611). In Deleuze and Guattari’s terms, Waldrop is a “foreigner in [her] 
        own language” (1977, 59). Entering language from a “skewed angle,” mindful 
        of her split relation to power — and the possibility that gender marks 
        the difference in that split — makes Waldrop’s work attentive to texts 
        that open into another story within American literature and history, without 
        making that story a mirror of her own. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Since it passes through history, since it passes 
        through and across cultures, languages, landscapes, and races, and since 
        it writes within and out of Williams’ words and forms, Waldrop’s <i>A 
        Key into the Language of America</i> cannot be described or understood 
        as an autobiographical reflection, or an exploration of her identity. 
        Rather, it reveals what being a “foreigner in [her] own language” allows 
        her to see, break up, imagine, and revise in historical texts and in constructions 
        of the self and personhood traced and retraced by history and habit. Between 
        the texture of a life lived and a text on the page, there are spaces of 
        translation — lines of flight and escape — that reconfigure the already 
        imagined shape of the self, that even demolish the precedence of a self. 
        Waldrop’s <i>A Key into the Language of America</i> reveals that a writer 
        attentive to this space can also reconfigure the already imagined shapes 
        of history and literature: this is the impetus moving through minor literature. 
        Deleuze and Guattari’s theory of the minor works against firmly entrenched 
        notions of resemblance that make the text a mirrored territory of the 
        self and history. Dana Polan explains that their concept of writing “stands 
        against psychology, against territory, by giving an author a possibility 
        of becoming more than his or her nominal self, or trading the insistent 
        solidity of the family tree for the whole field of desire and history” 
        (xxiii). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Deleuze and Guattari’s theory of the minor illuminates 
        the relations among language, power, territory, and innovation at work 
        in <i>A Key into the Language of America. </i>In their study <i>Kafka: 
        Toward a Minor Literature </i>(1986) Deleuze and Guattari define minor 
        literature as “that which a minority constructs within a major language” 
        (16). It has three basic characteristics: “the deterritorialization of 
        language, the connection of the individual to political immediacy, and 
        the collective assemblage of enunciation” (18). Their articulation of 
        the minor emerges from an assessment of people’s split and partial relation 
        to the language and culture in which they live: “How many people today 
        live in a language that is not their own? Or no longer, or not yet, even 
        know their own and know poorly the major language they are forced to serve?” 
        (19). Franz Kafka, a Jewish writer living in Prague, wrote not in Czech, 
        but in German, and forged a literature that is “affected with a high coefficient 
        of deterritorialization” (16). Kafka, in other words, wrote texts in German 
        that simultaneously articulate the “impossibility of writing other than 
        in German,” and therefore manifest Prague Jews’ “feeling of an irreducible 
        distance from their primitive Czech territory” (16). Writing this distance, 
        Kafka became, through intense lines of flight that become the process 
        rather than the signifier of desire (8), “a nomad and an immigrant and 
        a gypsy in relation to [his] own language” (19). Kafka’s work deterritoritorialized 
        the imperative within the German language to make one’s consciousness 
        an imitation of the self already imagined within its linguistic spaces. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For Deleuze and Guattari, the “lines of flight” that 
        characterize minor literature are resistant and desiring formations of 
        movement engaged in the process of deterritorialization, movements of 
        “becoming” engaged in the process of interrupting orders of thought, breaking 
        cemented maps that lead to the mirrored ends of familiar ideas and historical 
        memories. A line of flight is the appearance of a “heterogeneous line” 
        (7). A line of flight doesn’t move toward “freedom” — a state enforced 
        by dominant circumscription — but becomes new paths that don’t already 
        exist. In <i>Kafka, </i>Deleuze and Guattari explain, “The problem is 
        not that of being free but of finding a way out, or even a way in, another 
        side, a hallway, an adjacency” (8). At the opening of <i>A Thousand Plateaus</i> 
        (1987), they call attention to the orders within literature and the book: 
        “In a book, as in all things, there are lines of articulation or segmentarity, 
        strata and territories; but also lines of flight, movements of deteritorialization 
        and destratification” (3). “Lines of flight” are intimately caught up 
        with both literature and geography. In “The Superiority of Anglo-American 
        Literature,” Deleuze and Claire Parnet write: “American literature operates 
        according to geographical lines: the flight toward the West, the discovery 
        that the true East is in the West, the sense of the frontiers as something 
        to cross, to push back, to go beyond. The becoming is geographical” (37).</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This is a compelling portrayal of American literature, 
        but the literature of Early American history is replete with subjects 
        who fought and struggled to possess the status of personhood and sustain 
        the nominal self threatened by the lines of escape crossed and pushed 
        by American colonialists. A literary text that opens and rewrites a historical 
        document that transcribed a Native American language now lost, Waldrop’s 
        book intensifies the political circumstances and consequences of the minor. 
        <i>A Key into the Language of America</i> shares the characteristics of 
        the minor in that the young woman’s voice becomes a “collective assemblage 
        of [Native-American women’s] enunciation” (18), unsettles Williams’s language 
        as well as the assumptions his compatriots projected on to it, and brings 
        a political immediacy to the American conquest as well as the way historical 
        texts are currently read. And yet the young woman’s voice, a literary 
        and imaginative transcription of a voice that is denied subjectivity, 
        complicates the minor’s dissolution of the speaking subject. Can one become 
        a nomad in relation to one’s own language when one is bereft of one’s 
        history, culture, land, and identity? Deleuze and Guattari state that 
        in Kafka’s work “there is no longer a subject of enunciation, nor a subject 
        of the statement” (22). In a chapter entitled “Of Discourse and Newes,” 
        the young woman laments: “<b><i>Why speake I not, </i></b><i>I should 
        have asked, counting on articulations of sound forms in waiting” </i>(18). 
        This sentence does not attest to the movement of language unleashed from 
        the stranglehold of the author-subject position or the map of self; it 
        attests to a historical and political story that couldn’t be articulated, 
        a story attested to in retrospect by a fictionalized voice who didn’t 
        have the means to ask why she couldn’t speak. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s text complicates the theorization of the 
        minor because it assumes and calls attention to the disappearance and 
        eradication a major language can enforce. In the chapter entitled “Of 
        Eating and Entertainment,” the voice of the young woman tells of an experience 
        that qualifies as a line of flight from sense and subjectivity. Notice 
        how the disappearance of the “I” is coincident with encroachment of confusion 
        and nonsense: “<i>I began my education by walking along the road in search 
        of the heroic. I did not think to ask the way to the next well. Wilderness 
        like fear a form of drunkenness or acting like a boy. The ground begins 
        to slip. Rhythm of swallows seen from below. It is a strange truth that 
        remains of contentment are yet another obstacle” </i>(6). Writing, for 
        Deleuze and Guattari, is meant for becoming imperceptible, and these lines 
        move toward a language that is “head over and heels away” (1986, 26). 
        And yet this movement away from sense and subjectivity is rare in <i>A 
        Key into the Language of America</i>, since the history the young woman 
        finds herself within enforces impediment to every line of flight by denying 
        her a glimpse of recognition or coherence. Deleuze and Parnet write, “One 
        has to lose one’s identity…One has to disappear, to become unknown” (1977, 
        45). This formulation, while imaginatively galvanizing, seems idealistic 
        when examining the work such as <i>A Key into the Language of America,</i> 
        which attempts to engage a history that is most profoundly marked by enforced 
        loss.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As I have shown, Waldrop texts employ multiple forms 
        of reading, writing, and interpretation, many of which are ironic imitations 
        of the language, assumptions, and metaphorical equations Puritans brought 
        to their reading of Williams’ text. Deleuze and Guattari argue against 
        the typical hermeneutic “keys” for interpreting texts. They emphasize 
        Kafka’s hatred of metaphor, and write, triumphantly: “Kafka deliberately 
        kills all metaphor, all symbolism, all signification, no less than all 
        designation” (22). In answering their opening question “How can we enter 
        Kafka’s work?” they state: “We aren’t even trying to interpret, to say 
        that this means that” (7). And yet, it seems to me that since a major 
        language makes those subjected to it see and speak themselves within its 
        dominant code (a dominant code that is often subsumed into the invisibility 
        of ideology), literary exegesis, and an attention to metaphor, symbolism, 
        and signification, is required for understanding the ubiquity and tenacity 
        of this major code, the “this means that” of ideology. In an early poem 
        entitled “Remembering to Sleep,” Waldrop writes, “A dream, like trying 
        / to remember, breaks open words / for other, / hidden meanings” (28). 
        These lines describe what Waldrop’s <i>A Key </i>does, not within the 
        space of individual psychology but in language and the textual forms of 
        history. Without insisting on an allegorized code of hidden meanings, 
        a reading that “breaks open words” can reveal that “A crying fit /is cancelled” 
        (28) and in turn can give “a syntax to the cry,” as Kafka’s work does 
        (1986, 26). In other words, part of a poet’s or a literary critic’s line 
        of flight involves breaking open the words of the major language to see 
        the minor moving within its “cramped spaces.” This means employing — with 
        a resistant irony — the literary and linguistic tools through which the 
        major is sealed into dominance. Deleuze and Guattari discern: “When a 
        form is broken, one must reconstruct the content that will necessarily 
        be part of a rupture in the order of things” (1986, 28). Resisting literary 
        “archetypes” that work by “assimilation, homogenization, and thematics” 
        (7), Waldrop’s work demonstrates that a literary reading of historical 
        documents can inspire the breaking of their form, the reconstructing of 
        their content, and perhaps a interruption into history and memory’s ordering 
        of things.  </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Deleuze and Guattari do not propose or even indicate 
        that the minor can be utilized to highlight feminist interventions and 
        directions in literature and historical texts.  I think this possibility 
        opens when the minor is read within the frame of Waldrop’s text, though 
        <i>A Key into the Language of America </i>reveals that the lines of escape 
        might not be as direct or immediately freeing as they would have us believe. 
        Attempting to render the gendered voice haunting representations of the 
        Native American voice in American literature and culture, <i>A Key into 
        the Language of America </i>reveals that there is a feminized minor within 
        the minor literatures of American literary culture struggling to find 
        lines of escape. Native American culture is the primary and most extreme 
        example of Susan Howe’s pithy and accurate description of American literature’s 
        most salient themes and tendencies: “Lawlessness seen as negligence is 
        at first feminized and then restricted or banished” (1). Gayatri Spivak 
        concurs when she writes, “the Native American voice has been most rigorously 
        marginalized even within marginalization” (189). <i>A Key into the Language 
        of America </i>demonstrates that the gendered and sexualized embodiment 
        of that voice has been marginalized with even more rigor. Waldrop’s literary 
        and critical enactment of its forms, words, and ideas becomes a key to 
        unlocking — deterritoritalizing — the logic enforcing that rigor. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rosi Braidotti claims that feminist readings can 
        become or perhaps even exceed deliberate lines of flight if they, “develop 
        a consciousness that is not specifically feminine, dissolving ‘woman’ 
        into the forces that structure her” (395). <i>A Key into the Language 
        of America, </i>which attests to a Native American woman’s struggle to 
        become visible to herself in the midst of cultural clashes and historical 
        traumas prefaced both on women’s absence and femininity’s thick and ubiquitous 
        presence, moves back into history to see how both the actual and symbolic 
        dissolution of Native American women became the force structuring and 
        enforcing their absence. The young woman’s voice witnesses that dissolution 
        at the culmination of her search: “<i>I had finally reached the center 
        of the city. It was deserted, in ruins, as useless as my birth and as 
        permanent as a site of murder” </i>(66). <i>A Key into the Language of 
        America </i>calls attention to an enforced dissolution that should be 
        seen before the category of woman can be euphorically dissolved in American 
        literature’s lines of escape.  </p>
