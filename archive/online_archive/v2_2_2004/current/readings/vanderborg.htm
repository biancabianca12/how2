text-align:right'>—Adrian Johns, <i>The Nature of the Book</i><span
lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">At what point can a book be described as a finished 
          or an authoritative presentation? In an interview with Edward Foster 
          for <i>Talisman</i>, Rosmarie Waldrop argued that a book’s form is never 
          “‘absolute’” since there is no “definitive interpretation” of a text 
          by either the writer or the readers (36, 34). Her sense of the book 
          as an open form might characterize a range of postmodernist interventions 
          in source texts, from the “writing through” projects of John Cage to 
          the palimpsests of Susan Howe.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [1] </span></a> But what happens when a poem transplants not only the 
          language of a source book but also its organization — the outlines, 
          headings, and chapter structures that determine the way the audience 
          processes the book’s information? In a twist on her intertextual writing 
          style, Waldrop explores the implications of this subtly subversive theft 
          in the 1994 text <i>A Key into the Language of America</i>. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s book has the same title as its source, 
          Roger Williams’s 1643 study of the language and culture of the Narragansett 
          tribe. In addition to mixing selections of his English and Narragansett 
          words in her passages, she includes a copy of his title page, duplicates 
          his chapter titles, and imitates his division of information within 
          each chapter: cultural observations, vocabulary terms, and a concluding 
          poem. By adopting his organization in her own text, she scrutinizes 
          the different ways in which meaning can be categorized and visually 
          arranged within the book form, asking readers to reexamine the process 
          by which they assess any textual data as trustworthy. The result is 
          a “book-poem” that challenges the very concept of the book as a tool 
          to communicate reliable knowledge.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [2] </span></a></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The orderly arrangement of information in Williams’s 
          <i>Key</i> is the perfect background for the disruptive investigations 
          of a book-poem. Williams introduces his phrases and observations as 
          a much-needed cross-cultural guide, the symbolic key to an informational 
          treasure box of “<i>Rarities</i>” that can lead to still further discoveries: 
          “A little <i>Key </i>may open a <i>Box</i>, where lies a <i>bunch </i>of<i> 
          Keyes</i>” (83).<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [3] </span></a> To give readers easy access to that information, each 
          chapter lists vocabulary entries by theme (e.g., marriage, religion, 
          government) and carefully classifies commentary from the “<i>generall</i>” 
          to the “More particular” (104). A prefatory set of “Directions” (90) 
          ensures that the book will be “<i>pleasant </i>and <i>profitable </i>for<i> 
          All</i>” to use (83). Within the chapters, Williams combines concise 
          morals about “Pagans” who act more virtuously than the purportedly Christian 
          colonists (116) with repeated reminders to his readers in the didactic 
          poems about the need to restore New Testament values.</p>
        <P align="center" CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Bending the Book</b></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As in Waldrop’s previous palimpsests, her reproduction 
          of the source creatively distorts what it borrows.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [4] </span></a> At the thematic level, Waldrop’s <i>Key</i> pays tribute 
          to Williams’s nuanced treatment of Narragansett society and land use 
          while it also critiques his prejudices and omissions from a modern “immigrant’s 
          take on the heritage and complex early history of [her] adopted country” 
          (xxiii).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [5] </span></a> But mirroring Williams’s guidebook in this case turns 
          the entire structure of his <i>Key</i> into the foreign text — distanced 
          in both time and cultural context — to be analyzed. Waldrop copies and 
          subverts the function of each book convention that seems to guarantee 
          reliable information, explicitly rejecting a model of accessibility 
          or usefulness for her text. Waldrop’s remark that her “word lists,” 
          in contrast with those of Williams, “are not of practical use” (xxiii) 
          is only the first step in a project that substitutes false leads for 
          his directions, digressions for his arguments, and broken patterns for 
          his categories. Where Williams worries about colonists who fail to keep 
          their promises, Waldrop creates a book that self-consciously presents 
          itself as a deceitful resource, contradicting and dismantling its information 
          outlines. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Her introduction, for example, initially resembles 
          Williams’s prefatory material in providing explanations and usage notes, 
          but her guidelines conceal the actual relation between the two <i>Keys</i> 
          and the fact that her divisions of information are misleading. The statement 
          that Williams’s language is set off from her own writing by “its archaic 
          syntax and vocabulary printed in boldface” gives the impression of a 
          clear original to be retrieved so that “Roger Williams’s voice will 
          be recognized” (xxii). Yet the rest of the book undermines that expectation 
          of typographic distinctions in meaning. Some of the excerpts taken from 
          Williams’s chapters are reproduced in boldface type while others are 
          not, and this can include adjacent segments from the same sentence or 
          passage. Nor does the boldface signify more accurate copying. The seventeenth-century 
          phrases in either typeface may be altered from Williams’s language, 
          at times with minor changes in capitalization but often with deletions, 
          rearrrangements, or substitutions such as “<b>white men</b>” (17) for 
          Williams’s “<i>Englishman</i>” (136) that expand the meaning considerably. 
          Because of the discrepancies, readers unwilling to consult the 1643 
          text can never be certain of the exactness of any insert.</p>
        <P align="center" CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>What Is Fixed in Print</b></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s play with these faulty reproductions 
          raises broader questions about the stability and accuracy of printed 
          texts. The assumption that a book is a “reliable” copy of the information 
          it advertises is not an unquestionable part of print culture, book historian 
          Adrian Johns contends, but rather a belief that was deliberately constructed 
          over time — a construction exposed by acts such as piracy that made 
          it difficult to gauge the trustworthiness of a text’s contents (1-5). 
          “What could one know in such a realm,” he queries, “and how could one 
          know it?” (5). While Johns’s history in <i>The Nature of the Book</i> 
          focuses on unauthorized printing in early modern England, Waldrop is 
          interested in multiple practices by which the structure of a seemingly 
          fixed printed book can be altered or recontextualized and in the resulting 
          effect on an epistemology of reading. Beyond the underlying humor of 
          a new <i>Key</i> published by an author whose initials are also R. W., 
          Waldrop’s mix of borrowed structural devices with acknowledged and unacknowledged 
          revisions presents the book form as a contested space, the significance 
          of whose organization can always be reinterpreted. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop begins to reframe Williams’s book format 
          with her facsimile of the title page from an 1827 edition of his text. 
          His name and New England residence, as well as the printer’s name and 
          the date and place of the book’s publication, would have situated and 
          authorized the book for its contemporary audience. Waldrop’s caption 
          for the facsimile, however, underscores the status of his book as an 
          archival document, its information reassembled in the “<i>Collections 
          of the Rhode-Island Historical Society</i>,” and notes that permission 
          for reproducing the text must be obtained from a source other than the 
          original author or publisher (xii). The new publication of a historical 
          source and the minor formatting changes from the 1643 title page might 
          go unnoticed at first. But as a preface to Waldrop’s more dramatic transformation 
          of Williams’s book, they prompt questions about who controls the dissemination 
          of any “print / worthy” text (17). She develops the point in her introductory 
          remarks about the politics behind the late-eighteenth-century publication 
          of extracts from Williams’s <i>Key</i>. The texts<i> </i>deleted much 
          of his commentary, especially his criticism of the English settlers, 
          turning his work into a purely “utilitarian guide to customs and vocabulary” 
          (xix). Her description brings out the irony of altering a book’s information 
          in the ostensible interest of making the presentation of the data more 
          reader-friendly. Waldrop’s assessment of these prior texts is already 
          mediated as she echoes the editorial remarks in yet another version 
          of <i>A Key,</i> the 1973 volume edited by John J. Teunissen and Evelyn 
          J. Hinz. The implicit challenge to the audience is to decide whose authority, 
          if any, can be trusted to (re)produce the definitive reading edition 
          of Williams’s book. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Even without the problems of overt revisions or 
          competing editions, Waldrop suggests, a reprint might lose the time-dependent 
          information formats in a book. Her simple decision not to modernize 
          the spelling of the borrowed chapter titles produces, in Pierre Menard 
          style, a wholly different effect than that of the original source. The 
          titles refocus attention from expectations about the chapters’ contents 
          to the archaic nature of their own wording; headings that originally 
          evoked motifs of new information or change (e.g., “Of Discourse and 
          Newes” and “Of Travell” [17, 23]) now remind Waldrop’s readers that 
          they are looking at diction from three and a half centuries ago, “living 
          in translation…at arm’s length” from Williams’s subject of study as 
          the “message, slowed down by change of climate, becomes obsolete” (17). 
          The rhetoric of obsolescence also hints at the difficulty of finding 
          current sources to check the accuracy of the translations Williams outlines. 
          When Waldrop remarks that contemporary tribe members have consulted 
          Williams’s <i>Key </i>to choose Narragansett names because their language 
          is no longer spoken (xxii), she emphasizes his book’s conflicting roles 
          as an authoritative source and as a copy, a print approximation that 
          cannot be readily verified, however widely it may be reproduced. </p>
        <P align="center" CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>“Tidings on Condition”: Waldrop’s 
          Chapter Transformations</b></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If readers cannot necessarily gauge the reliability 
          of a book’s information, what are the internal formats that create the 
          impression of having easy access to trustworthy data? Waldrop moves 
          from scrutinizing the informational contract of a book’s introductory 
          material to the details of its chapter outlines and page layouts. Contrast 
          the two authors’ versions of chapter 2, entitled “Of Eating and Entertainment,” 
          as Waldrop turns Williams’s orderly layout into her own food “for thought” 
          about what presentations can or cannot be consumed easily in a book 
          format (5). Williams’s chapter opens with a vocabulary list, each line 
          divided into a Narragansett term or sentence at the left and the translation 
          at the right. Waldrop distorts his translation structure, undercutting 
          the reader’s ability to distinguish between the foreign and the familiar 
          by scattering informational “elements” from different contexts across 
          her page (see fig. 1). How does the reader begin to make meaningful 
          order of that page space? Her observation paragraph precedes the word 
          list here as if promising an interpretive frame, but there is no gloss 
          even for the words from Williams included within the passage itself. 
          The boldface type, instead of drawing attention to important points, 
          accentuates the impression of information that has not been fully assimilated 
          into the frame text. The one Narragansett term remains doubly opaque; 
          without Williams’s lineation, it is not clear that “<b>Red Copper Kettle</b>” 
          is the translation of “<b>Mishquockuk</b>,” nor where the two boldface 
          entries with their closing punctuation fit into the list of unpunctuated 
          modern compound terms following the implied “food” (5). With page structures 
          that refuse to clarify their information categories, the book’s promise 
          of “words…fit to eat” never leads to a master key to decipher all the 
          codes (5).</p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In addition to the disjointed page formats, the 
          argumentation itself turns information into “<i>noise</i>” (4) from 
          the very excess of its claims. Like Williams’s text, Waldrop’s book 
          provides didactic points, but hers are spliced together from so many 
          theses in the two <i>Keys</i> that it resembles what Christian Bök has 
          described in his own book art as “a route composed of nothing / but 
          detours” (n. pag.).<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [6] </span></a> The background for Waldrop’s digressive route in chapter 
          2 begins with Williams’s comment that “<i>Indian </i>corne…is a dish 
          exceeding wholesome for the <i>English </i>bodies” (101). The food imagery 
          is part of his moral that the Narragansetts could serve as a model of 
          temperance and generosity for the colonists, and yet at the same time 
          he describes himself as an Elijah-like figure in the “wildernesse” being 
          “<i>fed</i>” by “<i>These</i> Ravens,” he also indirectly suggests the 
          tribe’s need for a man of God to convert them (105). </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s chapter argument fractures itself into 
          simultaneous responses to different parts of this message. The opening 
          paragraph seems to satirize Puritan theology in the unexpected, paradoxical 
          description of the corn “boiled with free will and predestination,” 
          and she reduces Williams from being fed by ravens to eating “crow” for 
          the religious bias in his accounts of the Narragansetts (see fig. 1). 
          Waldrop’s rhetoric of “devouring” language and lands, moreover, evokes 
          other images of invading “white bodies” and “Unsuccessful” uprisings 
          (5) that ironize in retrospect Williams’s goal of promoting communication 
          between the tribe and the settlers. The passing reference to “<b>wives</b>” 
          (5), in turn, opens a new line of questioning, anticipating Waldrop’s 
          critical scrutiny of past and present gender roles. She inserts an extra 
          section in the second page of this and every chapter: a centuries-spanning 
          “narrative…in the voice of a young woman, ambivalent about her sex and 
          position among the conquerors” and fully aware that “conquered” cultures 
          are troped as feminized (xxiii, xx). In chapter 2, the narrator’s description 
          of her early “<i>education</i>…<i>in search of the heroic</i>” leads 
          only to the concluding poem’s image of female bodies as commodities 
          to be appraised and consumed: “all flesh considered / as a value” (6). 
          If the reader is hard pressed to extract a single lesson from these 
          overlapping critiques, the confusion is deliberate. By adding new divisions 
          and by refusing to provide the stages of a discrete counterargument, 
          Waldrop emphasizes the interpretive constraints of any one outline and 
          the conclusions derived from its organization; the chapters of her revisionist 
          history keep their own premises open for redirection. </p>
        <P align="center" CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Broken Frames and Scattered Lists</b></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s language play continues the process of 
          strategic digression. While the parodic logic, syntactic games, and 
          rapid shifts in subject of her previous palimpsests have been well studied,<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>

          the information barriers among chapters. Chapter 18, “Of the Sea,” vividly 
          exemplifies the disruption of ordering devices as she takes her own 
          “<b>hatchet</b>” to Williams’s connections (see fig. 2). The first line 
          of the prose poem offers no description of the titular sea beyond the 
          fragments “A site of passage, of dreadful to move on, of depth between,” 
          in which the prepositional phrases fail to specify the origin or destination 
          of a journey (37). Instead of Williams’s expository sentences, her syntax 
          outlines information that is never delivered. She presents a comparison 
          in “Close resemblance” without clarifying the details being compared 
          or offers choices whose contrasts are equally ambiguous: “long neighborhood 
          or early development” (37). As the pun on “all at sea” implies, the 
          paragraph is organized to induce the “bewildered” sense of being “<b>drowned</b>” 
          in an unfamiliar, “overwhelming” set of syntactic cues (37). </p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">With this degree of interpretive difficulty, Waldrop’s 
          reader might turn from sentences to words as the smallest semantic units 
          of the book. Instead of Williams’s thematically connected word lists, 
          however, her lists defy semantic classification. To draw out the “depth 
          between” linguistic “surface[s]” in chapter 18, she assembles terms 
          linked chiefly by the fact that they form words or compounds when combined 
          with the initial three letters “sea” (see fig. 2). Either one gives 
          up on a subject category for a list that includes “[séa]nce” and “[sea] 
          cucumber” or else considers multiple possible relations among the different 
          terms while acknowledging the arbitrariness of any temporary ordering 
          (37). One could read a word in dialogue with the chapter term, transforming 
          the domestic space of a “bed” into a geological formation in “[sea]bed” 
          (37), or could treat the lists as independent poems. The reader’s desire 
          to figure out the relation between words, for instance, is mockingly 
          reflected here in the letter groups of “mstress” and “son” that suggest 
          a family unit of <i>mistress</i> and <i>son</i> (37). </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Even beyond the specific lists, the attempt to 
          single out theme words for a section ultimately undermines the divisions 
          among chapters as Waldrop turns her <i>Key</i> into a dictionary of 
          deferrals. She sometimes inserts entries from one of Williams’s chapters 
          into a different theme chapter in her <i>Key</i>, and her own central 
          images of coinage, tongue, water, and skin—terms that seem most directly 
          connected to specific chapter motifs—are also the ones whose contextual 
          definitions are scattered broadly across chapters, creating alternating 
          impressions of superfluity and contradiction. There are so many early 
          allusions to the “coining of new words” (5) and to bodies as sexual 
          currency that the overview of these motifs in the chapter on “Coyne” 
          seems belated (49-50). For other words, the chapter contexts purposely 
          clash with each other. She juxtaposes chapter 14’s references to “skin” 
          color and “<i>racial discrimination</i>”<i> </i>(30) with the images 
          of characters “shedding skin” in chapter 10 (21) as if contesting stereotyped 
          identifications; the book’s later portrayal of “<i>unidentical skins</i>” 
          may refer to either the differences between lovers or the subjective 
          perception of a single body (see fig. 3). The result of these shifts 
          in information exchange in <i>A Key</i> is that the book’s semantic 
          subdivisions are visible chiefly when they are being violated. </p>
        <P align="center" CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>The Non-Sense of an Ending</b></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The transgression of information boundaries is 
          nowhere more evident than in Waldrop’s satiric revisions of Williams’s 
          thematic and formal closure. In the book as a whole, she keeps the progression 
          of his chapter themes from greetings to burial customs but ends her 
          text with a deliberately nonlinear image that resists summation: “then 
          life could not / be understood forward / or backward” (66). The contrast 
          with Williams is just as pointed in the concluding poems in other chapters 
          of their <i>Keys</i>. His rhyming quatrains are miniature sermons as 
          in this excerpt from the verse in chapter 18:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1><i>I have in </i>Europes <i>ships, oft been</i></div>
        <div class=Section1><i>In King of terrours hand;</i></div>
        <div class=Section1><i>When all have cri’d, </i>Now, now we sinck,</div>
        <div class=Section1><i>Yet God brought safe to land. </i>(Williams 179)</div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">His conclusion tightly structures the sea chapter’s 
          information, reminding readers that the details should be interpreted 
          more in light of the “Power of God” (179) than of human ingenuity in 
          seafaring lest they miss the point of the providence behind Williams’s 
          own New World mission. Waldrop’s poem, however, offers “dark thoughts” 
          rather than enlightenment, cautioning readers that they are likely to 
          find a premise that “holds / no water” in its indeterminate, unpunctuated 
          fragments (see fig. 3). Her section celebrates abstract images of flux 
          in “exchange” and “displacement” (38) that question the stability of 
          the language in which one might make any definitive assertion. “[T]ense” 
          may be a noun or an adjective here, and the chapter term “sea” doubles 
          homonymically as a verb in the allusion to what “swimmers see” after 
          immersion, while the descriptions point to something outside their imagery 
          with the recurring preposition “beyond” (38). </p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For all the puns on vision, what Waldrop’s chapter 
          conclusions tend to foreground is white space. The copious white space 
          around the earlier lists and the short poetic lines leads into the blank 
          space at the end of each chapter. Her passages anticipate this transition 
          with their images of whiteness, pallor, and absence. These references 
          qualify her often-cited description of the “palimpsest” as an information-rich 
          composition, a model of plenitude and presence in which the “blank page 
          is not blank” because “No text has one single author” (“Form and Discontent” 
          61).<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [8] </span></a> Despite all the authors who crowd these pages — Williams, 
          Michel Fardoulis-Lagrange, Claire Needell, and Howe<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [9] </span></a>— the blank spaces in <i>A Key </i>interrupt the information 
          transmission with textual lacunae that do not signify even as palimpsestic 
          traces. Alongside the attempts to recover the “<i>traces of the push 
          across this continent</i>” (60) — the conquests and the enduring hate 
          language in slurs such as “red skin” (26) — Waldrop’s lacunae remind 
          readers of what cannot be “read” at all, of the blind spots and failed 
          translations in projects of textual and historical recovery. Critics 
          have discussed the motif of gaps and missing centers in her books as 
          a strategy of disrupting authoritarian narratives (Evans 287), as an 
          acknowledgment of the fallacies in historical records (Freitag 452 and 
          Clippinger 199), or as a symbol of liminal spaces that can lead to new 
          ways of perceiving the self and the world (Keller 393). </p>
        <P align="center" CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><strong>A Book-Poetics of Limits</strong></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But there is little discussion of those gaps as 
          part of Waldrop’s retheorization of the book itself. The thematic and 
          stylistic play with white space, for example, recalls the blanks in 
          Stéphane Mallarmé’s book-poetics; she analyzes his approaches to silence 
          as spiritualized acts of “negation” revealing the limits of thought 
          and language (<i>Against Language?</i> 17-18). In particular, Waldrop’s<i> 
          Key</i> adapts the gendered imagery of book thresholds and limits in 
          his critique of conventional reading techniques. When Mallarmé describes 
          the white spaces of the book form revealing the “mystery” of the pages’ 
          lettering, he warns readers not to view the “virginal foldings of the 
          book” only as borders to be penetrated to gain “possession” of the text 
          (82, 83). Waldrop’s <i>Key</i> resists such forcible appropriation with 
          its consciously “<i>difficult unfolding</i>” (16). Her narrator gives 
          the reader hints of “<i>parts called private and more or less so,</i>” 
          with the “<i>flesh close up</i>” — like the space of the chapter’s conclusion 
          — unreadably “<i>pale</i>,” but here the pallor<i> </i>“<i>terrifie</i>[s]”<i> 
          </i>rather than entices the reader/“<i>lover</i>” (see fig. 3). In a 
          later chapter, she imagines the body as text darkening completely to 
          “<i>a dead end</i>” that the lover will abandon for more familiar structures 
          (60). As the blurring of dark and white imagery suggests, both the printed 
          and unprinted book spaces in <i>A Key</i> can contribute to a sense 
          of depleted meanings as Waldrop replaces Mallarmé’s vision of richly 
          significant typography with her own misleading shifts in type. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Following a line of influence from Mallarmé, the 
          blanks, interruptions, and wounded bodies throughout <i>A Key</i> are 
          even closer to the book metaphors of Edmond Jabès. To quote from Waldrop’s 
          translation of <i>The Book of Questions</i>: “‘<i>So the empty space 
          between two pages or two works is the place and non-place where our 
          limits of ink and screams are set up and broken down</i>’” (Jabès 381). 
          In Jabès’s post-Holocaust text, the book is a form that both marks the 
          failure of language to articulate catastrophic loss and yet continually 
          revises the rules of expression in its interpretive word play and cross-generic 
          experiments.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [10] </span></a> That description might well characterize Waldrop’s 
          goals in <i>A Key</i>. I have argued that Waldrop juxtaposes a history 
          of betrayed treaties with a reverse strategy in her own text: she exposes 
          the thematic and formal “<i>platitudes</i>” (54), “exaggerations” (23), 
          and “Discrepanc[ies]” (41) in her outlines, declaring the book “print 
          / worthy” precisely because it advertises its artifice: “<b>Some Body 
          Hath Made This Lie</b>” (17). But her provisional structures do more 
          than simply reveal the limits of a specific type of book presentation. 
          They invite readers to speculate about a book whose most basic information 
          remains in flux, and if that text cannot be fully realized within a 
          single material format, it nevertheless suggests new directions for 
          a book-poetics to develop. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">That is the reason why Waldrop’s text offers such 
          diverse answers to the question posed by the stolen title: to what data 
          is this new text a key? Taken to its extreme form, her project outlines 
          a book-poetics of absence without a fixed author-function, the book 
          reduced to an empty frame whose title and layout can be adapted to the 
          content, or lack of content, desired by each new occupant. Yet her play 
          with textual editions also suggests that the frame itself is unstable, 
          prompting readers to imagine a book composed as an ongoing collage of 
          different formats and print incarnations of its information. This might 
          include not only manuscript drafts<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [11] </span></a> but also fragments of competing publication copies, 
          reprints, excerpts, and translations all vying for authority. And in 
          that contested authority, where would one place a book form based on 
          acts of piracy that deliberately misrepresents its promised contents, 
          a text that simultaneously copies too much information and too little? 
          Poised between the prospect of purely deceitful or absent forms (a “night 
          too long ago for architecture” [7]) and an excess of possible structures 
          (“High surface motion, endless, endless” [37]), Waldrop makes sure that 
          the “complex variables” (55) in her own <i>Key</i> never permit an absolute 
          or conclusive book. Of all the text’s information, the brief warning 
          label “Liable to sudden deviation” remains the most reliable signpost 
          for the reader caught in the playful “ambush” of the book’s evolving 
          forms (59). </p>
