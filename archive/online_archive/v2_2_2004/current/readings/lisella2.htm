        Work of Lyric Discourse in a Long Poem by Genevieve 
        Taggard</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">by Julia Lisella</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P><blockquote>
      <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">[A version of this essay was delivered at the American 
          Literature Association’s Symposium on Twentieth Century Poetry, Long 
          Beach, California, March 2003]</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">During the late 1920s when Genevieve Taggard began 
            writing  “Evening-Love-of-Self,” the narratives of oppression and 
            liberation from which she operated—socialism and feminism—were already 
            fragmented and varied. In this poem, one senses, too, Taggard’s growing 
            acknowledgment that the feminist discourse available to her through 
            the Bohemian ‘20s may have already become a silenced discourse in 
            modernist and socialist circles. On the surface, this poem reflects 
            what a good Marxist may have considered to be pure middle-class bourgeoisie 
            preoccupation with self. Yet, I argue, Taggard’s poem carves out a 
            place for individualist reflection and community action through a 
            variety of lyric and narrative techniques that at times counteract 
            and at other times counterbalance each other. Direct address to her 
            readers, interior monologues, third-person narrative, apostrophe, 
            fusion of narrator and subject all wind her two subjects—individual 
            emancipation and social revolution—together. And though it operates 
            as a long, investigative narrative, the poem itself becomes an aesthetic 
            promotion of the lyric form as strongly as it is an argument for an 
            increased feminist agenda within socialism. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> “Evening Love-of-Self” also plays with our own 
          expectations of both modernist and leftist inspired poetics. Taggard 
          considered herself a Communist and a modernist. Those of you working 
          on leftist poets of the 20s and 30s will know that there was easy commerce 
          between these two terms, but that this fact is presently somewhat forgotten 
          or neglected (or as Cary Nelson characterizes it, repressed) literary 
          history. Though Leftists had their quarrels with High Modernists—for 
          example, Taggard disliked “The Wasteland” and described it as  “nihilistic”—many 
          radical left poets of the 30s saw themselves as part of the modernist 
          project. The debate about poetics in the 1930s focused more on degrees 
          of preoccupation: Leftist enough? Modernist enough? Accessible enough? 
          Too much experimentation was bourgeoisie and self-aggrandizing, yes, 
          but ignoring the possibilities of what poetry could do linguistically, 
          was, for artists like Taggard, a publicly committed Communist and self-proclaimed 
          modernist, simply naïve and silly.  </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> “Evening Love-of-Self” has all the makings of 
          a poem that desires to withdraw, at least temporarily, from the debates 
          among Taggard’s fellow Communist and other leftist poets about the relationship 
          among lyric, interiority, inventiveness of language, and social action, 
          not by abandoning such themes and goals, but rather by accentuating 
          their seemingly impossible and irresolvable contradictions. In shape, 
          voice, content and conclusions, “Evening-Love-of-Self reads like a breakaway 
          poem from a social vision agenda, at least as it had been marked off 
          by other leftist writers and theoreticians at the time. But as I will 
          argue here, the poem consistently insists on an opposite reading as 
          well—a statement of what we might identify today as feminist socialism, 
          a term Taggard would not necessarily have chosen herself because of 
          the particular relation women Communists had toward their party allegiances. 
          In many respects, Taggard took her feminism for granted. At the same 
          time, she and many other leftist women writers really struggled to make 
          a place for a feminist critique within their notions of socialism and 
          revolution. The editorial notes in <i>Collected Poems  </i>indicate 
          that Taggard wrote this poem simultaneously with her other work, lyrics 
          that focused on romantic love and maternity, and poems on social themes. 
          Begun in 1927 in New Preston, Connecticut, she returned to work on it 
          in New York City in 1928, Cornwall-on-Hudson in 1928, Mallorca, where 
          she lived briefly, in 1932, and finally, completed it in Bennington, 
          Vermont in 1934 when she was  40 years old. The poem’s history indicates 
          a continuity of concern for Taggard,  a desire extending over several 
          years to articulate a space between the social and the private, the 
          political and the interiorized, for an introspective poem that could 
          resonate politically.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Taggard takes a  favorite subject of lyric: subject 
          in nature reflects on his life. Only this lyric gesture is carried out 
          in a Wordsworthian fashion. By that I mean, it’s long, 21 pages long. 
          And the subject of the poem is neither a wise older man reflecting back, 
          or a young woman waiting for the world to begin as in the early lyrics 
          of Edna St. Vincent Millay, but rather, an older, married woman, wondering 
          where her life has taken her. A third-person omniscient narrative voice 
          separates reader from subject, but as I’ll suggest this distance breaks 
          down at various moments in the poem, fusing narrator and subject. The 
          backdrop of the poem is a fall evening, and a speaker describes a woman, 
          alone, on a hill, watching the sunset. In the course of the poem, the 
          woman examines her long marriage, and her own lack of extraordinariness. 
          Just as the poem readjusts subject, content, and form, and even address 
          of a typical lyric poem, it also abandons any precepts of good socialist 
          writing or narrative poetry one might have come to expect from such 
          a committed radical as Taggard.  The title, for example: Is the title 
          a built-in critique of the speaker’s self-absorption? After all, the 
          title itself seems a strident commentary on the Left’s worry over the 
          self-interested nature of lyric poetry—love of self.  Or is the title 
          an early recommendation to her socialist allies to include concerns 
          for the psychological health of the oppressed, especially women, in 
          their analyses of revolution?  </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Just as one begins to measure the meaning of the 
            title, Taggard throws up another major hurtle to experiencing the 
            poem outside of a leftist or within a purely lyrical tradition:  she 
            sets up the title against the epigraph, a  quote from  an essay by 
            Rebecca Pitts, a fellow political writer from <i>New Masses</i>. It 
            reads:   “. . . this profound turning away from life and from the 
            world takes place on a large scale only in periods of social stagnation 
            and despair.”  The 21-page poem that follows, Taggard seems to be 
            telling us, is both a tale of one woman’s struggle and a reflection 
            of our entire culture. One woman’s despair is a response to a society’s 
            “stagnation.” Pitts herself firmly believed that “the specific dilemma 
            involved in being a woman . . . is social rather than biological” 
            and that “only Communism offers women the right to be an independent, 
            productive worker [sic] . . . [and] the right to a freer, more natural 
            sex happiness” (<i>Writing Red </i>7).  Pitts was an ideological theoretician 
            and her confidence in the Communist Party to cure gender inequalities 
            engaged its own brand of orthodoxy.  Taggard’s position in “Evening 
            Love-of-Self,” on the other hand, is more ambiguous about the power 
            of Communism to cure female unhappiness, but the poem also operates 
            from Pitts’s conviction that the difficulties of being a woman are 
            socially constructed rather than biologically determined.  Taggard 
            asks: How could the Left address the kind of personal oppression an 
            ordinary woman might experience through the limits she endured as 
            a wife or a mother?  By beginning with Pitts’ quote, she places an 
            issue off limits or avoided by her fellow Communists as self-indulgent 
            within the parameters of CPUSA debate: the onus for a solution, for 
            a way to include even personal despair, is placed onto the community, 
            on her (with any hope, politicized) readers, and on her generation. 
            It begins with this insistence on identification with her audience: 
            “She did what you have done: watched a still sunset.”  As she had 
            noted in the introduction to her <i>Collected Poems,</i> Taggard wants 
            to make clear to her readers that one single woman’s despair can be 
            likened to a universal experience. The narrator says of the woman: 
            “Not knowing why, ineffectual she felt, human and crude.”  The narrator 
            emerges more sympathetically and closely aligned to the woman by capturing 
            that feeling of defeat in which the everyday tasks feel impossible:  
            “We must remember our names, and the houses we sleep in.”  </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In terms of form, the poem is a hybrid, too, narrative 
          in length, yes, but telling very little story, containing very little 
          “history”, and engaging many techniques of lyric in shape and voice. 
          In one of the more self-conscious moments of the poem, Taggard writes, 
          “ What is pure cannot be destroyed; destruction is only / Breaking what 
          is corrupt into units of purity.”  Could the lyric represent that smallest 
          unit of linguistic “purity”?  And if so, what would that mean in terms 
          of its power to effect social change?  Though “Evening Love-of-Self” 
          is an epic-length poem, it also strongly argues in favor of these “pure” 
          lyric moments in which corruption, whether it is public and political, 
          or private and domestic, can be broken down and revealed.  That revealed 
          corruption here could be interpreted as the life the speaker leads, 
          and the marriage she’s arrived at, seemingly without will or agency.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Unlike  many of Taggard’s poems that focus on women 
          as mothers, this poem depicts a childless woman. She is not oppressed 
          by factory work, endless hours of providing childcare, or by racism 
          or poverty, but by the loneliness of a seemingly conventional marriage 
          and her own unmet expectations of herself.  In addition, it seems far 
          from Taggard’s small lyric efforts presented in poems like “With Child.”  
          There is very little redemption in this poem, there is no political 
          conversion of the subject herself, and nor does Taggard resort to the 
          more standard CPUSA solution to individual depression—to be more involved 
          with the Party [a solution that was often offered by the CPUSA’s women’s 
          newspapers as Constance Coiner pointed out in <i>Better Red</i>, her 
          study of Tillie Olsen and Meridel Le Sueur (56-57)].  And in contrast 
          to some of her contemporary prose writers, such as Olsen or Le Sueur, 
          who often placed their characters within a realm of experienced older 
          women, Taggard seems to have had little confidence in the power of alternative 
          communities of working women to solve or to cope with psychological 
          issues.  </p>
          <p class="doublespace">Although the poem describes the withdrawal of 
            one human being from communal life, the poem invests the individual 
            woman with insight; the group does not necessarily possess any particular 
            wisdom or salvation for this woman. The despair and sense of alienation 
            in the poem runs so deeply that one might even suspect the poem will 
            end in suicide, though it does not: “She took the other step, one 
            inch off centre. / She chose, seduced from routine, from neglect and 
            habit / To try the other way. Not ours. Her nature froze / Against 
            us, our stupidity, our natural day.”  The poet continues to watch 
            this woman and in the course of the poem, speaks for her and at times 
            makes room for the woman’s direct speech. Sometimes this speech is 
            marked off by parentheses and sometimes not. And sometimes the speech 
            in parentheses seems the narrator’s speech and not the direct speech 
            of the woman. These shifts create an odd sense of both instability 
            and connection between the narrative voice and the subject’s voice. 
          </p>
          <p class="doublespace">In many ways, Taggard treats the subject of this 
            poem the same way that she treats other subjects of her more identifiably 
            social vision verse. She describes, ascribes motives, paints a portrait 
            of despair and lack. At the same time, however, the close connection 
            between narrator and subject challenges her notions of documenting 
            hardship. Critics such as Louise Kertesz have also noted the way in 
            which Taggard boldly disassociates a woman’s unstable emotional state 
            from immaturity here—not childhearted tears but rather, adult anger:  
          </p>
      </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <P>. . . (Spent life in bad purpose, bad and barren:<br>
            Pumping water with grim lips, dropping dead stovelids,<br>
            Hatred of life making my hands blur under my eyes. . .<br>
            And tears never; nothing so clean as tears; nothing so<br>
                        child-hearted. 
          <P>But adult anger, brutal response to the plain facts <br>
                        about me.) (132)
          </blockquote>
      <p class="DOUBLESPACE">At a time when Freud’s theories of female hysteria 
        were gaining momentum in American culture, claiming that women’s anger 
        could be explained by societal expectations rather than childhood trauma 
        was truly radical from a feminist perspective, but also from the perspective 
        of her position as a Communist: This woman takes charge of her anger, 
        her “hatred of life making my hands blur under my eyes”. There is no avant 
        coterie of political analysts in this poem. This woman is in charge of 
        her own analysis of her own labor, her life, and her musings, which Taggard 
        does not trivialize: “She said what others said; ate the same food, gestured. 
        / Nothing was about her. Then after melancholy years / Once to stand in 
        her faded dress consulting the sky / For omen of some sorrow not located 
        in events called real. . . .” (ellipses Taggard’s) 136. She literally 
        pulls herself out of despair, reasoning herself to live. But although 
        the woman chooses life over death, it is not a joyful option:</p>
      
        <blockquote> 
          <P>The evening hour indulged her; only evening,<br>
            With that nobility her genteel nature craved<br>
            Held her fair image—poetic semblances;<br>
            Adages, faint wisdom, piety and negation.<br>
            So rarely clear, her world, so very rarely,—<br>
            Fogged and distracted often; this one evening<br>
            Hung in the west, declared the world again,<br>
            In limpid light kindly to nerves and senses.<br>
            She, lonely as all her kind had been in New England,<br>
            Gazed at the waning ray. (135) 
          </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1> 
          <p class="doublespace">For Taggard the poet, as much as for the woman 
            subject of the poem, this movement from despair to acceptance becomes 
            its own source of radical and personal statement.  The speaker’s genteel 
            nature craves a “fair image,” something “poetic,” something that might 
            fit the old forms, something, I’d like to suggest, that fits lyric 
            poetry but in the end, simply can’t be accommodated by lyric and can’t 
            be accommodated by the political public poem, either.  Both subject 
            and the speaker accept the burden of their legacy as individualistic 
            New Englanders, and their future.  They “declared the world again.”  
            By page 145, near the end of the poem, it is hard to tell who is speaking. 
            Poet-narrator and woman-subject merge. There are no parentheses marking 
            off the speech here:</p>
        
          <blockquote> 
            <P>Death, since I have known you so, forget me,<br>
              Since I have burrowed past your three dark hills, forget me,<br>
              For I am far from ripe for your cold plunder,<br>
              And colder now than even death could make me. . . 
            </blockquote>
        
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poem is chilling, and atypical of leftist 
            poetry, in its refusal to liberate the subject of the poem, but the 
            resolve of the speaker to face the sunset with a sense of her own 
            dignity is emancipatory, in a new way, I would say a “feminist” way, 
            too.  Her self-realizations help her to conclude that her life has 
            the potential to be worth something.  Taggard does not settle back 
            into the safety of third-person narrative until the final few lines 
            of the poem. She ends the poem demanding her listeners identify with 
            the subject rather than judge her, and by repeating the first few 
            lines of the poem:  “She did what you have done: watched a still sunset. 
            / Saw absently where it went down, a simple sun.”  By refusing to 
            release the subject of this poem from her purgatory of despair, Taggard 
            suggests that the power of poetry itself is limited:  It cannot necessarily 
            redeem but only reveal and unveil personal and political crises.  
            It can strip experience down to its essentials. At the same time, 
            just as the epigraph and opening lines of the poem suggest, these 
            last few lines remind us that this woman’s private moment of reflection 
            means nothing without our presence, and our willingness to acknowledge 
            our shared emotional lives.</p>
