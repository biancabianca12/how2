        <div class=Section1>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Holding and reading Rachel DuPlessis’s drafts gathered 
            together in one solid and serious volume confirms a conundrum about 
            her draft-work. There is the provisionality of this writing, running 
            through it at all levels, and there is the completeness of each draft, 
            each fold, each individual volume<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> [1] </a> and, now, the culmination of one volume. 
            The contradiction or tension between these apparent oppositions creates 
            an endless series of questions as to how to read the writing presented 
            here. On the one hand, there is no pretence in DuPlessis’s writing to 
            perfection or closure, simply a commitment to continuation and to provisionality. 
            We can read the drafts then as a continuous work in process of the kind 
            DuPlessis, in her essay, “Manifests,” suggests might provide an escape 
            from conventionally gendered genres:</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote> 
          <div class=Section1>The notion of writing a long poem forever, or as long 
            as it takes to explore 
            memory and its losses, enters here if only to cast myself off into a 
            space whose
            terms can be a generic manifold, and certainly entail ‘something larger.’<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> [2] </a> &nbsp;</div>
        </blockquote>
        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">On the other hand, each draft can also be read 
            as a whole, spiralling around its own centre, returning to and repeating 
            material, yet maintaining a sense of a beginning and an end. Often at 
            the beginning of a draft, we feel as if a space for performance is being 
            cleared. “Draft 26: M-m-ry,” for instance, begins:</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here is the space for action, a theatre, a page, 
          a white space in which voices, marks, words and letters will move, sound 
          and think in a dynamical performance. Throughout this draft and others 
          I am struck by the cosmological sense of the bigness of this space in 
          contrast to the fragmentary smallness of words, objects and tiny narratives 
          which appear within it. Once again though, at the end of the draft there 
          is almost always a sense of partial resolution, of closure.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Textually, the mechanism of the fold, by which the 
          final nineteen folds refer back to the previous nineteen, formalises the 
          self-referential nature of DuPlessis’s writing and creates yet another 
          shape or structure, another way through the writing. Here we become involved 
          in a constant <b>re</b>-reading of the work. Yet, however closely we follow 
          the folds of the drafts, however many connections we draw, the effect 
          is that of moving in a series of concentric circles, a spiral which gradually 
          homes in to the place where we are, but which never gets there. This endless 
          desiring deferral of presence enacts its own brand of <i>différance</i>. 
          The enfolded nature of the work prevents us from settling into reading 
          the drafts <b>either</b> as a seamless whole <b>or </b>as a series of 
          discrete pieces. Instead we find that we have a continual, overlapping 
          sense of beginning again and again: we are always “incipit” (the title 
          of the twentieth draft). Equally, “(the end ends up) every/ where,” as 
          DuPlessis says in “<i>Writing</i>,” the prelude poem to the drafts.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> [3] </a> The endings of drafts often imply this 
          re-turning, re-folding, constant and simultaneous ending and beginning 
          again “Draft 26: M-m-ry,” whose beginning is cited above, ends:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Take it all as a loss.<br>
            Begin anywhere. (168)&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perhaps most fittingly for the whole project, “Draft 
          14: Conjunctions,” which was the final draft in DuPlessis’s second book 
          of drafts ends:&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>I throw it all <i>as</i> far <i>as</i> I can,<br>
            <i>and</i> it blows back, blows black,</p>
          <p>“a certainty based on the acceptance of doubt”<br>
            in “texts at once perfect <i>and</i> incomplete.” (99)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Being the reader of such a challenging work is not 
          a passive affair as we leaf back and forth through the texts: “…the reader 
          is at large, as the poet is. We are strained companions,” says DuPlessis 
          in her “<i>notes on ‘Writing</i>.<i>”</i><a href="#_edn4"
  name="_ednref4" title=""> [4] </a> We, 
          like the writer, must work to enact the performance, to make the writing 
          “work”. We join in the Georgics, the poetic husbandry, of the “land of 
          poetry” (“Draft 38: Georgics and Shadow,” 262). This ethos of poetry as 
          work dominates this final draft and its fold, “Draft 9: Working Conditions.” 
          “Work” implies seriousness, as does the weight of the title, “Toll.” This 
          is all part of the “strain” of an open text which opens up the relationship 
          between producer and receiver and blurs the division between them. It 
          also poses another conundrum, for the drafts are also sites of “play.” 
          &nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The playfulness of DuPlessis’s poetry, a lightness 
          of touch reminiscent of Gertrude Stein, drew me to her work from the start. 
          It is a “play splice” of word and letter slippage, the slip between letter 
          and word; a love of the little word and the conjunction, a playing out 
          of metonymic games, of punning, homophones and homonyms, an eager and 
          “errant” exposure of the unstable nature of language. DuPlessis creates 
          a metonymic field around almost every word she uses, surrounding words 
          by a range of connoted words, associated both sonically and semantically. 
          This is part of a longstanding experiment in plumbing the depths of the 
          arbitrariness of the relationship between sign and referent. In DuPlessis’s 
          writing, all language becomes “other,” foreign and strange, all writing 
          and reading an act of translation, an image which recurs frequently in 
          the drafts. As we read, language becomes so vibrant, or we become so aware 
          of language that, even where only one word is used, we see more than one. 
          &nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Reader and writer act as “companions” as we begin 
          to recognise the full aura of words around each word we use. “Sentence” 
          for instance often functions in both its grammatical and legal sense, 
          whilst “letters” is used to refer to alphabetical letters and to correspondence 
          and hence communication.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> [5] </a> These words, as so often, are themselves 
          related to writing practice, thus demonstrating once again the self-reflexivity 
          of DuPlessis’s linguistic and literary practice. The titles of the later 
          drafts confirm this, referring to the language of the book space itself, 
          “recto” and “verso.” These suggest an opening up and looking behind the 
          page, behind literary language and genres. So we learn new ways of reading, 
          as DuPlessis constantly creates new ways of writing, opening up the space 
          on the page, using the alphabet, the points of the compass, the rhythm 
          of renga to create arbitrary yet meaningful structures. Yet she is working 
          all the time with<b>in</b> the dynamics of the page, as the following 
          from “Draft 4: In” confirms:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inside 
            the ruminant middle.<br>
            </b>read through the other, not so much over but the<br>
            simultaneous conflictual overloaded presences for which even<br>
            “palimpsest” is too structured a docket. Three dimensional<br>
            page, a page place or plage, a plage space, a play splice<br>
            the flimsy drops of scrim through which they filter, shapes<br>
            and lights<br>
            <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
            make the gesture<br>
            </b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comes 
            through me<br>
            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
            perfectly calm practice <b>it is this<br>
            </b>yet there is the tension of making a strange train. (26-7)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These lines speak self-reflexively of the page as 
          a playful and open space, a “three dimensional” force field for action. 
          The images of shapes and lights suggest the page as a material space, 
          rather than a flat sheet, a space rushed through by language. Yet, the 
          emboldened text also suggests the body, ”the ruminant middle,” as the 
          tunnel through which the language of the train comes. These readings co-exist 
          and shift between plain and bold text, as in these final lines of “In”:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>a traveller thru <b>are</b> <b>the senses of </b>dark holes tunneling 
            grainy paper.<br>
            Gathering all because of being in it,<br>
            yet<br>
            I am getting the force of it, <b>in</b>. (27)&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here and throughout the drafts the page space is 
          an eroticised physical space. The physicality of that space has always 
          been associated in DuPlessis’s work with the female body, in particular 
          the specifically feminine fluids of blood and milk, which run through 
          the drafts like veins, and which “Draft 2: She” urges us to draw on, to 
          drink from:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Draw drafts of “milk” these words<br>
            are milk the point of this is<br>
            drink. (18)&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The idea of “writing the body” was undoubtedly a 
          seed point for DuPlessis as she embarked on a career of innovation within 
          language and, as “Manifests” suggests, within genre. A new old language 
          is the prize and remains an important idea and ideal to DuPlessis from 
          her early writings on the Etruscans to “Draft 36: Cento” which explores 
          the failure of Esperanto. Though the drafts are never utopian, there are 
          peaks of joy and release, and the whole suffused with the fluidity that 
          gives hope of access to difference.&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Although DuPlessis is most commonly known as a gender 
          theorist or “French Feminist,” she has always been her own theorist and 
          artist and she continues to engage with a wide range of European and American 
          ideas. Gender theory remains unresolved but alive in her inter-related 
          theoretical and poetic work. On the first page of her early, much anthologised 
          essay, “For the Etruscans,” she wrote, “Fish on one foot, hook on the 
          other, angling for ourselves.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> [6] </a> This statement has always seemed to 
          me emblematic of DuPlessis’s quest for a different and feminine aesthetic 
          within a post-structuralist economics of desire, the hook. The tenor of 
          the phrase captures the texture of her writing, witty, performative and 
          painful. The fish and the hook are placed awkwardly, piercingly, yet comically, 
          within the body. The body — of the woman and of the writing — is the site 
          of the quest. The phrase can also be read as a joke on the idea of “writing 
          the body” which becomes here ungainly, hazardous, nigh impossible, and 
          yet still deeply desirable. At the same time, DuPlessis’s simultaneous 
          desire to write the female body, yet to resist what she names the “trans-historical 
          theorisation” of the female body remains and is inevitably part of an 
          implicit and explicit debate with “French Feminist” theorists.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> [7] </a> In both the enfolded poems, “Draft 
          2: She” and “Draft 21: Cardinals” feminine <i>self</i>hood is only attainable 
          against an <i>edge</i> of socially-constructed gender and marginalisation 
          of the feminine, hence the use of the word “selvedge” which appears in 
          “Cardinals” and forms the title of a pre-drafts poem in <i>Tabula Rosa. 
          </i>“Selvedge,” defined in the dictionary as the edge, border, or margin 
          of a woven piece of material, suggests the edge or border of self but 
          also a self that can only exist on the margins of the social sphere.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> [8] </a> </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">DuPlessis’s “origami foldits,” although multi or 
          trans generic, ”the avant-garde at its best,” as Wesleyan’s press release 
          proclaims, refuses to pretend that constraints do not exist, be they are 
          cultural or literary. Containment and categorisation cannot be written 
          out of the text. Genre and Gender then, and their genuses, their histories, 
          concern her, as do time and place, another categorisation, and how language 
          is broken up and categorised from punctuation on the page to sound in 
          the voice or ear ... and all this gets into the draft writing:<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here “<b>G.</b>” is genre, but immediately also gender, 
          the gender of genre and genre of gender seamlessly knit, yet the seamless<i> 
          is, as we have seen cut across</i>, spaced and severed into “segmentivity,” 
          which is all DuPlessis decides we can say poetry is.<a
  href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> [9] </a> 
          The choice <i>is</i> made for poetry, even as she upturns its pretty expectations: 
          “brekkkl they brekk the lyric ruck” (“Draft 3: Of”, 19). The work toward 
          a new language is carried out in between and within the constrictions 
          presented by the literary and gendered world. &nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The space of the enfolded page is not only a site 
          of erotic joy, but is, as frequently, a dark or black or threatening and 
          enormous space:&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>tolled sky writing:</p>
          <p>and it was wide and it was<br>
            black—er—blank<br>

            (“Draft 7: Me,” 40)&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here we see how page space can also be a space of 
          pain, death, loss and repression, as the falling movement of A/byss, ab/cess, 
          am/bush suggests. The journey of the draft is also an entering in to the 
          “gap,” as one of the drafts is entitled, the quest of a poet into the 
          past, as the phrase from “Manifests,” “memory and its losses,” suggests. 
          Memory, both limitation and liberation, haunts and is courted by these 
          <i>re-</i>draftings, this <i>over -and-over </i>writing. <span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This sense of the past in the drafts is strongly, 
          though not explicitly, associated with the skeletons shadowing western 
          conscience, in particular the loss, the toll, of the Holocaust. Present 
          and past, life and death are written over each other, plaited together 
          and there is a call to witness this:&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>walks thru the daily                               walk thru the dead<br>
            to write the dead                                   to tell the living.<br>
            (“Draft 4: In”, 24)                                 (“Draft 6: Midrush”, 
            <i>37</i>)<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Arial'>&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The need to for the past to be “tolled” grows stronger, 
          if anything, throughout the draft-journey. The “point” of “Renga” and 
          other later drafts reinforces the sense of the pain of the past, but also 
          the importance of pointing to it, of language as a pointer, as the “deixis” 
          of how we say “look! there!” one to another. It raises questions about 
          philosophy in its most basic sense of how to live; as DuPlessis writes 
          on into the later drafts epigrammatic statements are offered which encapsulate, 
          if not resolve, these questions:&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Catching the brunt of time<br>
            Given the memory of the site<br>
            Should we be grateful or angry?<br>
            Glad to submit or glad to be spared it?</p>
          <p> There is ladder and chain, binding and knife.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>[…]</p>
          <p>The point is — not to question what you are given;<br>
            The knife is, you can’t help it.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            (“Draft 32: Renga”, 217-8)&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">So it is that through the journey into the past, 
          the “langdscape” of “historical and contemporary particulars” that DuPlessis 
          goes beyond the gender issues with which she was at first associated and 
          enters the wider world of cultural politics. Gender is never discarded, 
          but becomes instead part of a complex criss-crossing of cultural issues. 
          She is always exploring the question of “how to speak that which is/ ‘repressed’” 
          (“<i>Writing</i>,” <i>Rosa</i> 72). The “repressed” here refers not only 
          to the Freudian unconscious, but also to the political unconscious, buried 
          in and under language. Twice, in texts written some years apart, DuPlessis 
          refers to a line from a review of Aaron Siskind’s photographs, “the social 
          world drained from his work,” in such a way that it seems to encapsulate 
          one of her greatest fears.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> [10] </a> Marginalisation is at the centre of 
          her work; the <i>realpolitik</i> is always present, but always examined 
          through linguistic interrogation, rather than polemics. The consumer society, 
          with “malls a homey homeless home/ ahung with things” is a linguistic 
          “gridlock of possessives,” and it is the “(geopolitical, material, narrative)” 
          <b>signs</b> of the Chinese jumper on sale in the mall that reveal the 
          power of credit (“Schwa,” <i>Drafts 3-14, </i>68). At times the sense 
          of global exploitation, war and the disapora of scattered peoples becomes 
          a diaspora of scattered words living in and on the waste of our culture. 
          Just as it takes joy in the dance of words, so at times, the drafts are 
          haunted by the fear that they can do nothing to “change the course of 
          events” but “profiteering, prophesying, sighing,” so that letters become 
          a string of sounds, a scream of pain, not play:&nbsp;</p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here Walter Benjamin’s “seizing hold” is grasped 
          but only to become DuPlessis’s “hole of a memory,” the abyss of history, 
          through which our own contemporary falls into the gap or abyss. <i>Both</i> 
          hole <i>and</i> hold are present however in the later “Draft 14: Conjunctions,” 
          a draft which celebrates little words and allows a joke to play around 
          the idea of hole/hold, even as it frames yet another conundrum:</p>
