        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We were asked to “respond” to Rachel Blau DuPlessis’ 
            <i>Drafts 1-38, Toll</i>. My response(s): awe, admiration, flood of 
            associations, conviction of vast significance, desire for more time. 
            Moments of rich, plumbable density give way to depths that are much 
            more difficult to fathom; they reach back through, now, sixteen years 
            of the work’s composition and into the tangle of DuPlessis’ modernist 
            roots. The best commentaries on the <i>Drafts</i> project — Lynn Keller’s 
            chapter on DuPlessis and Beverly Dahlen’s feminist revisioning of 
            seriality and collage, Hank Lazer’s discussion of early “Drafts” in 
            terms of the multiplication of lyric, and DuPlessis’ own statements 
            on her work’s parataxis and span — have mapped <i>Drafts</i>’ complex 
            horizontal landscape; I want to begin examining the nature and stakes 
            of its verticality.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [2] </span></a> These coordinates are DuPlessis’, drawn 
            from her unsurpassed 1981 discussion of Pound’s political deviations 
            from the objectivist base he shared with George Oppen.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [3] </span></a> A more complete version of the reading 
            I’m here sketching would hope to situate <i>Drafts</i> with respect 
            to <i>A Draft of XXX Cantos</i> and Oppen’s long serial poems according 
            to these coordinates, in particular to clarify the gains DuPlessis’ 
            thickly literary and reverberative poetics make over a certain flatness 
            in Objectivist documentation, and to distinguish her verticality from 
            the “hierarchy of evaluation” and “didactic intention” that undid 
            Pound.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [4] </span></a> In what follows, I’ll address the first 
            of these concerns by beginning to differentiate DuPlessis’ work with 
            “little words” from Oppen’s. My epigraph suggests one way of understanding 
            the latter problem: where the <i>Cantos</i> staked their claim for 
            coherence on the future apotheosis of Pound’s political and aesthetic 
            values, <i>Drafts </i>enacts a remembrance that DuPlessis has identified 
            as a facet of her writing’s “creolized Jewishness”: finding redemptive 
            possibility in a melancholic return to the debris of personal, cultural, 
            and literary history.<a href="#_edn5"

          <p align="center">***</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Draft 33: Deixis,” DuPlessis assembles a 
            miniature canon of contemporary poetry around a series of representative 
            deictic gestures — those demonstratives, like “this” and “that,” that 
            point something out, show it, prove it directly. Her collection of 
            citations from Stevens, Hejinian/Breton, Oppen, Creeley, and Lauterbach 
            is remarkable for the pinpoint accuracy of its sampling, for the vast 
            swath of poetic history navigable along the axes of little words. 
            This is a nodal point in <i>Drafts 1-38, Toll</i>, one of many, surely. 
            In a work draped formally around the figure of the “fold,” it would 
            be more appropriate, perhaps, to talk of seams than nodes. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But the languorous spatiality of the “fold” doesn’t 
            adequately express the punctual energies of DuPlessis’ writing. <i>Drafts</i>’ 
            critical task is to manage the rhetoric of temporality: to generate 
            or “seize hold of” those instants in language where “memory…flashes 
            up in a moment of danger.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [6] </span></a> The ghosts of Paul De Man and Benjamin 
            enter here to initiate my effort to describe <i>Drafts</i>’ deictic 
            poetics. I want to gauge the weight that DuPlessis’ language bears 
            in time, the long back story inhering in the little words also charged 
            with the “now” of the poem’s being on the page and in the act of reading. 
            The “flash” and “shock” of Benjamin’s dialectics at a standstill and 
            the iterative regress of De Man’s allegorical sign adorn opposite 
            faces of the rhetorical coin that DuPlessis has called “the strange 
            doubleness of deixis,” by which she means its status as both a pointer 
            and a shifter (the way pointing — here! — depends on a transactional, 
            social context for its legibility).<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [7] </span></a> DuPlessis has built 
            her long poem around the cultivation of these depth-charges; they 
            emerge in the method of retrieving and commenting upon fugitive fragments 
            that she calls “midrash,” and that we might also call, following Benjamin, 
            “redemptive criticism.”<a href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [8] </span></a> </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The moment from “Draft 33: Deixis” shows one 
            version of this method at work. Excerpting it is a challenge, however, 
            and for reasons that begin to mark DuPlessis’ difference from Oppen, 
            whose bi-directional line endings and “forward-pulsing” syntax creates 
            the interminable press of connection that DuPlessis has named the 
            “poetry of affiliation” and deemed “as difficult to excerpt as any 
            poet I know.”<a href="#_edn9"
name="_ednref9" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [9] </span></a> If Oppen’s 
            unbound thought makes it hard to parse his poems’ spatial fields, 
            DuPlessis’ allusiveness creates temporal binds that are equally difficult 
            to sever. “Deixis” is an essay in verse in which lines of poetry are 
            accompanied on the page by footnotes, the only “Draft” in a volume 
            littered with quoted language to include the juridico-exegetical apparatus 
            of citation within the field of the poem itself. The other thirty-seven 
            drafts rely on endnotes, but in “Deixis” the footnotes are simultaneous 
            with the sense of the passage, and so I’ll cite it by reproducing 
            both pages here:</p>
          <p><b><img src="images/Rifkin1.gif" alt="&quot;Deixis&quot;" width="397" height="745"></b></p>
          <p><b><img src="images/Rifkin2.gif" alt="&quot;Deixis&quot;" width="392" height="696"></b></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While the best way to refer to this moment in 
            <i>Drafts</i> is to copy the pages that it is on, the best way to 
            read it is with reference to those other pages to which it refers.<a
href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [10] 
            </span></a> The passage thus extends the “sense certainty” scenario 
            in the <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> (cited in “Deixis,” not incidentally, 
            in footnote 4, pg. 223), in which Hegel tests the truth of the phenomenological 
            claim “Now is Night” by writing those words down and then finding 
            them to be “empty” the next noon. What <i>is</i> “true,” if unspeakable, 
            is the materiality of the writing itself; DuPlessis calls it “yet 
            another space, in space that’s / neither Night nor Now.” We might 
            call it “this piece of paper” (223).<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [11] </span></a> Iterability renders Hegel’s deictic 
            “now” empty. DuPlessis’ text goes some distance towards resisting 
            that function of language by bringing its context everywhere it goes, 
            thereby insisting on its facticity as a page of writing even as it 
            acknowledges dependence on a broad apparatus of literary usage.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [12] </span></a></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This insistence is “the inaugural act of reference 
            [from which] all other forms of reference will flow” (Wlad Godzich, 
            cited in DuPlessis’ footnote 24, 234). In DuPlessis’ case, the other 
            acts of reference are other poets’, but they get newly animated by 
            their placement in her poem, beginning with the two words that end 
            Wallace Stevens’ “Man on the Dump”: “the the.” In “translating” “the 
            the” into “that that,” DuPlessis finds in both the definite article 
            and Stevens’ poem an “emphatic” quality that may have been there all 
            along. “That that,” to extrapolate from an argument DuPlessis cites 
            in a footnote attached to a later passage in “Deixis,” can be read 
            further as “look! look!” DuPlessis’ version has the otherwise jaded 
            Stevens answering his question, “Where was it one first heard of the 
            truth?” in the present tense of his poem, with a primal cry for connection.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The other cited deictics are notable for the 
            way their crystallized poetics “bear[s] the indication of the person” 
            into DuPlessis’ text (Note 13, above). The play of proximity and distance 
            in the mutual formation of both love and self is, of course, Creeley’s 
            great theme, and enjambment one of his most powerful instruments. 
            Placing his three lines on her one, DuPlessis both flattens his affect 
            and pays homage to his urgency, which is especially keen when compared 
            with Lauterbach’s more self-conscious use of both deictics and slashes 
            as the title of a poem. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“That they are there!” enters DuPlessis’ text 
            unaltered, a kind of manifesto writ small for Oppen’s particular poetics 
            of little words. The phrase comes from “Psalm,” a poem whose most 
            famous lines are its final ones: “The small nouns / Crying faith / 
            In this in which the wild deer / Startle, and stare out” (<i>New Collected 
            Poems</i>, 99). In “Psalm,” the line DuPlessis excerpts hews closely 
            to the object of its pointing: “The wild deer bedding down.” From 
            the perspective of the “small nouns,” then, the key word in “That 
            they are there!” is “they.” But “that,” I think, is what catches DuPlessis’ 
            interest. Not a typical deictic in this instance, but a kind of conjunction, 
            it introduces a dependent clause and suggests the elision of a pivotal 
            phrase in the principle one: “I am certain that” and “the fact that” 
            are two of the more likely candidates.<a href="#_edn13"
name="_ednref13" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [13] </span></a> In 
            both cases, “that” alludes to a persuasive rhetorical scene where 
            knowing and sharing knowledge, even convincing others of it, are linked.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“That they are there!” is thus the “instance 
            of discourse that bears[s] the indication” not of those wild deer, 
            but of Oppen’s person — his voiceprint — into “Deixis” and <i>Drafts</i> 
            as a whole, where it joins many other such instances and indications 
            (Note 13). DuPlessis creates her long poem as the medium of such joining, 
            which she names “It.” “The problem,” she writes a little later in 
            “Draft 33,” is “how to make poetry / constructed of It” (231). In 
            a more critical register, we might identify this medium with what 
            DuPlessis has called the “transactional” facet of “the strange doubleness 
            of deixis”: “Pointing needs to be accompanied by a sense of sociality, 
            of the transaction, while speaking and understanding require abilities 
            to decode and appreciate contexts,” she writes.<a href="#_edn14"
name="_ednref14" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [14] </span></a><sup> 
            </sup>Flashes of insight are dependent on a large-scale social and 
            literary apparatuses, which include the history of prior pointings. 
            <i>Drafts</i> incorporates these contexts, and becomes one itself.</p>
          <p align="center" >***</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There is a difference between poetry in which 
            “it” is “constituted as a topic” (229), and “poetry constructed of 
            It.” Both present thorny and worthy problems for writing; DuPlessis’ 
            achievement is to produce <i>Drafts</i> structurally as the latter. 
            The long poem begins with “it” as a topic. In the first Drafts, indeed 
            in the first lines of the first Draft, DuPlessis launches a poetic 
            of encountered objects, in the high Objectivist sense that includes 
            words and letters in the encounter. “Draft 1: It” begins graphically, 
            with typed and then handwritten repetitions of “N.” As if following 
            that letter’s peaky movements, the page continues as a kind of polygraph 
            of consciousness. Jotting is the poet’s mode:</p>

          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A little later in “Draft 1,” Duplessis notes, 
            “To reinvent ‘attention’ is narrow tho tempting. / Doesn’t get the 
            folding” (4). This first page doesn’t exactly reinvent attention, 
            but it does recreate the dazed moment in which an awakening consciousness 
            first tests its powers. Glints and tips of sensory experience and 
            the light and sound of the natural world’s initial processes slowly 
            merge with the social, here composed of vague memory, “song,” the 
            “silver backed” mirror that first forms the self-consciousness of 
            “governed being[s],” and, perhaps, Gertrude Stein. DuPlessis names 
            her later in the “Draft,” and I can’t help but read “sugar as dirt” 
            as a telegraphic combination of <i>Tender Buttons</i>’ “sugar is not 
            a vegetable” and “dirt is clean when there is volume.” “Draft 1” isn’t 
            built on the structure of allusion and citation, but we’re in an elemental 
            universe already beset by distinctions of convention and etiquette 
            — Stein’s — and it makes sense that even DuPlessis’ most primitive 
            records of awareness would include her.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">From the beginning, there are dangers associated 
            with poetry in which “‘it’ is constituted as a topic.” Without constant 
            vigilance, the poetry of encounter and documentation can blossom into 
            what DuPlessis calls “postcard poetry,” by which she means the metaphorics 
            of conventional lyric: “a this a that like / a boat like a dog” (4). 
            Though she began <i>Drafts </i>as “an investigation of some ‘little 
            words’ — pronouns and pronomials,”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [15] </span></a> DuPlessis recoils from the diminutive 
            in its feminized form as the stuff of lyric beauty: “Well now what’s 
            / to speak what is / to speak when that / Object (pronoun) / squeaks 
            its little song in its bright white / dear dead dark” (5). “It”’s 
            vocal limits are set by what DuPlessis calls the “foundational cluster” 
            of the lyric, where female figures are either “dear” or “dead” or 
            “dark” and women poets squeak, or perhaps “peep” or maybe even “twit.”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [16] </span></a> </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Haibun: ‘Draw Your Draft,’” DuPlessis recalls 
            her early resistance to the “perfection of lyric” as embodied in H.D.: 
            “I did not want the…purity of lyric…Thus my allegiance to the Objectivist 
            purities, because they offered some way of skepticism and quasi-refusal, 
            some method of documentary” (115). In “It,” and throughout <i>Drafts</i>, 
            the Objectivist purities, if by this we mean the “data of experience” 
            in Oppen’s sense, also feel insufficient.<a href="#_edn17"
name="_ednref17" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [17] </span></a> While 
            the Objectivist stance provides a baseline ethics of poetic observation 
            extending into intersubjective encounter and even a politics, DuPlessis 
            presses words for something more, a reach beyond reference and into 
            the mystical thicket of language itself.<a href="#_edn18"
name="_ednref18" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [18] </span></a> We 
            feel this first sketched in “Draft 1” in a “note to self” that reads 
            as a kind of benediction: “Let silence / In the form of words’ / in. 
            IT”(6). </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“The form of words’ in” imagines the poetics 
            that <i>Drafts</i> realizes as it accumulates, for which “even / palimpsest 
            is too structured a docket” (27). It takes time: <i>how </i>words 
            are dense, what their interiors might contain, these are difficult 
            questions to fathom. Early on in <i>Drafts</i>, this difficulty prompts 
            a refiguration of the materials of writing: “The mark is dark, the 
            page / <b>dark</b> / is the first imagination of this drawing, this 
            drafting / these draughts” (26). “Getting the force of it, <b>in</b>” 
            is represented as a matter of physical exertion, as if the pen’s tip 
            on “tunneling grainy paper” might press through to the palpable core 
            of language and bolding words render their meaning self-evident. DuPlessis 
            returns again and again to the page and its markings in an effort 
            to ground the work, aware, certainly, that these moments remain the 
            most resolutely figurative. </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“I have nothing to say, / only to show,” DuPlessis’ 
            slightly modified version of Benjamin’s statement of method for the 
            <i>Arcades Project, </i>would seem to underwrite this (abyssal) poetics 
            of linguistic self-evidence (62). But “Draft X: Letters,” where DuPlessis 
            cites Benjamin’s statement, takes a more in-depth approach to “the 
            form of words’ in,” imagining letters’ inner lives through a set of 
            remarkable riffs on the typewriter’s “qwerty” alphabet. DuPlessis’ 
            typewriter is a very different machine from the one Charles Olson 
            commandeered to facilitate the “immediate” transfer of “energy” from 
            poet to reader in “Projective Verse.” If the keys on Olson’s typewriter 
            functioned as a “stave” for the poet’s breath, on DuPlessis’ they’re 
            a store for her memory:</p>

          <p>This “Draft” is dedicated to “I.M.E.W.B. June 19, 1914-May 3, 1990” 
            and DuPlessis has said that it includes words from her mother as she 
            was dying of breast cancer. Here, the mother may not speak, but the 
            language “bears the indication of [her] person” in the lushness of 
            its colors and textures, and an indication of the poet in the enjambed 
            flow of her mournful attempts to describe. These indications remain 
            vague; the deictic gestures in this passage — all those its and thats 
            — point to a set of contexts that remain personal, hermetic to those 
            of us who weren’t there.</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But “V” is also resolutely poetic, by which I 
            mean social, transactional, and historical in the senses I’ve been 
            discussing with respect to <i>Drafts</i>’ deictic poetics — its urgency 
            has depth. “V” looks and feels like a sonnet that got distorted, just 
            slightly, when it was pressed onto the page. And while <i>Drafts</i> 
            resists elegy as a form of the lyric “trading in transcendence and 
            turn,”<a href="#_edn19"
name="_ednref19" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [19] </span></a> “Draft 
            X” is unabashedly elegiac — flowers are strewn, ashes are scattered, 
            seasons change, stones sing. It closes with an alternative to traditional 
            elegy’s variations on Christian apotheosis: a Jewish messianic image 
            of shattered glass, the breaking that points to the possibility of 
            <i>tikkun olam</i>, repairing the world. DuPlessis’ glass isn’t joyfully 
            crushed under a groom’s stomped foot, though, it’s “smashed against 
            a wall, a door, / thrown against the inoperable sealed-up exit;” mournful 
            movement towards consolation mingles with melancholic intransigence.<i> 
            Drafts </i>incorporates the entire nexus. This “human shard” is not 
            Charles Reznikoff’s talismanic Objectivist fragment “still itself 
            among the rubbish.”<a href="#_edn20"
name="_ednref20" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> [20] </span></a> By 
            which I mean it is not self-evident, nor extractable, not an emblem 
            of mute integrity. This is an alphabet of loss with a long literary 
            history as well as a keen personal significance; the letter on the 
            page marks the site of their ongoing mediation. This, in other words, 
            is It.</p>
          <p align=center style='text-align:center;
line-height:200%'>***</p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Drafts” 14, 38, and 52 repeat the question, 
            “What, then, is the size of the/this loss?” and as <i>Drafts</i> accumulates, 
            the answer becomes increasingly apparent. As DuPlessis puts it in 
            “Draft 17: Unnamed”: “it is not ‘the Jews’ / (though of course it’s 
            the Jews) / but Jews as an iterated sign of this site” (111). <i>Drafts</i> 
            is haunted throughout by remembrance, at a distance, of the Holocaust; 
            tracing DuPlessis’ treatment of this specific content deserves sustained 
            critical attention. I’ve been interested more generally in her midrashic 
            or redemptive-critical activity of selecting, glossing, and incorporating 
            shards of “the loss” — of the mother, of poetic forebears like Oppen, 
            of “the Jews,” of the immediacy of pointing — in all of its layered 
            urgency. DuPlessis meditates repeatedly on the hubris whereby, for 
            instance, a <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> story about a woman who “stood 
            at the pit / where/ this 50 years/ 155 Jews were shot,” gets into 
            her poem, even as the woman herself left the “dozens of notes and 
            addresses / tossed away / moments before their deaths,” at the site 
            where they lay (110). DuPlessis’ act of writing “is not elegy,” she 
            says, though we know that it is elegiac, nor is it poetry, at least 
            not the kind Adorno proclaimed “impossible,” “barbaric” after Auschwitz. 
            It is the deictic “social agreement that something can be pointed 
            to,” even if that something is catastrophic and no one is left to 
            bear witness (234). </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Draft 52: Midrash,” an unpublished “Draft” 
            finished this May, DuPlessis confronts the Adornian prohibition directly, 
            or rather indirectly, through the “gridded series of embeddings and 
            strange angles” that make up her by turns angry, questioning, conciliatory, 
            defiant essay in verse. DuPlessis’ burden in “Draft 52” must at some 
            level be to justify her own vocation and daily practice, and she doesn’t 
            shy away from it. Each of the numbered sections mediates Adorno’s 
            position differently: from parsing his language, to identifying with 
            him, to uncovering apparently contradictory statements elsewhere in 
            his oeuvre. Perhaps “poetry” meant to him “only affirmative décor…tears 
            at graves, / female visitants”?—this is, after all, the foundational 
            cluster of the lyric that DuPlessis has so successfully resisted. 
            Might Adorno’s call, in <i>Minima Moralia</i>, for “perspectives” 
            that reveal the world “to be, with its rifts and crevices, as indigent 
            and distorted as it will appear one day in the messianic light” be 
            a summons to poetry? But then, trying to write, what <i>can</i> a 
            poem be, after Auschwitz? “There is no accurate lexicon,” she concedes, 
            “The only poem is blackened, barred-out lines.” </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Early on in “Draft 52,” a moment of seeming defeat 
            points, negatively, to <i>Drafts</i>’ answer to Adorno:</p>

        <blockquote>

        <div class=Section1> 
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After Auschwitz, a certain poetry of witness 
            — of occurrence and documentation — fails. The “this” that happened 
            is impossible to point to “as such.” “That it is,” which echoes one 
            of Oppen’s grounding statements on the poetics of sincerity, is not 
            adequate either, especially if it opens onto a poetry in which “it” 
            is “constituted as a topic” and multiplied haplessly to include “wood,

            and — imbedded therein — the long and specific history of failed efforts 
            to speak it. As DuPlessis puts it at the close of “Draft 52”: “One 
            little scrap where something is. / Incommensurate.” </p>

            against the grain” in order to rescue the “now-times” from the homogenizing 
            path of progress is a later version of the same method. For my developing 
            understanding of the deep connections between Benjamin’s materialism 
            and his theology, I depend on Richard Wolin’s <i>Walter Benjamin: 
            An Aesthetic of Redemption</i>, (Berkeley: University of California 
            Press, 1994). The <i>German Tragic Drama</i> reference is cited on

            of Poetry</i>, Bob Perelman notes of innovative poems in the tradition 
            of Pound and Olson: “to quote them / you need a photocopier not a 
            word processor” (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996) 7. Though 
            I’ll discuss a few moments in <i>Drafts</i> that “tend,” in Perelman’s 
            terms, “toward the pictoral and the gestural,” in this instance the 
            difficulty in excerpting derives from the fact that the work adheres 
            closely to the typographical and referential standards of criticism, 
            but demands to be “close read” and referred to like poetry.</span></p>

            Man’s, in his essay “Hypogram and Inscription,” <i>The Resistance 
            to Theory</i>, (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986). 
            On what writing down “now is night” does to sense certainty, de Man 
            writes: “because he wrote it down, the existence of a here and a now 
            of Hegel’s text is undeniable as well as totally blank. It reduces, 
            for example, the entire text of the <i>Phenomenology</i> to the endlessly 
            repeated stutter: <i>this</i> piece of paper, <i>this </i>piece of 
            paper, and so on” (42).</span></p>

            <i>Phenomenology</i> to elucidate what might be called the deictic 
            dilemmas in Robert Grenier’s work — from his collaboration with Barrett 
            Watten on <i>This </i>magazine through his more recent experiments. 
            In Perelman’s reading, Grenier’s work “manifests a desire to escape 
            all literary historical grids and to make direct contact with the 
            world via pen and paper” (<i>Marginalization</i>, 38). The <i>Phenomenology</i> 
            passage evidences language’s failure to coincide with the present 
            and points to a certain tragic humor in Grenier’s efforts. My reading 
            of <i>Drafts</i> suggests DuPlessis’ more affirmative approach to 
            the deictic dilemma — her concerted proliferation of the vast “grids” 
            underlying pointing’s immediacy.</span></p>

            where allegory — the representation of an expressible something by

            I’m arguing that DuPlessis’ fragments are allegorical, shard-like
