            <P CLASS="TITLE2">Daniela Gioseffi</P>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After witnessing the tragic disaster of 9/11 first hand 
              and having the ashes of three thousand people rain down on me and 
              my home in New York City, I could not write about the disaster. As 
              I smelled the fire day in and day out for weeks afterward, I could 
              not find a way to be powerful enough, until I met the lovely child 
              in the piece named Meagan some weeks later in Concord Massachusetts. 
              Her idealistic and moral little spirit healed me.  I was heading for 
              a writer’s retreat in the Berkshires when I met her with her father 
              near Walden Pond. She gave me hope enough and uplifted my spirits 
              enough to open me again to writing and end my block about the subject 
              of this horrendous event. I have to feel hope, “that thing with feathers 
              that perches on the soul,” in order to write as I write to offer transcendent 
              truth. I have to write through horror and misery and pain toward the 
              light in order to feel that writing is not a </P>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>futile task. I often portray the sad and repulsive 
              side of life in order to write toward the light at the end of the 
              dark tunnel. Just to tell of misery and corruption gives me no inspiration. 
              I wanted to take the reader through some kind of closure, or transcendent 
              feeling, toward a hope in humanity for the future.</i><i></i></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            I’d watched the rolling, billowing 
              ball of fire thunder skyward, over and over again in my nightmares, 
              heard the roaring blast as I stood stunned with the pain of lives 
              being lost inside the  huge towers. Some leapt to their deaths rather 
              than be sizzled alive. An explosion that big, loud and ugly had never 
              been witnessed by any of us who stood on the roof deck that fateful 
              morning breathing the blast of jet fuel fire and ash of workers lives 
              raining down on us. As the grey United Airlines jet deliberately crashed 
              into the second tall tower on the horizon of the Manhattan skyline, 
              I shouted, “Terrorist attack!” We ran from the roof as the fire thundered 
              up, fearing for our lives. The superintendent of our tall building 
              immediately ordered an evacuation. Minutes later, I stood at the edge 
              of the Brooklyn Heights waterfront watching the tall towers collapse 
              in clouds of grey smoke from the skyline just across the East River. 
              As thousands died in one blasted instant, my daughter was in the hospital 
              for an exploratory surgery, while my husband, ailing with a terminal 
              illness was struggling for his life.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Three weeks later, on a bright autumn 
              day out of a fairy tale, I’d seen my daughter through her surgery 
              and she was okay.  I’d dropped my ailing husband to visit with his 
              grandchildren, perhaps for one last time for all we knew, in Salem, 
              Massachusetts. Shaken and distraught, I’d headed for a retreat in 
              the Berkshires, my first time free from nursing my husband in two 
              years. I’d visited the Nathaniel Hawthorne Wayside House in Concord 
              — a home previously owned by Louisa May Alcott’s father, a man of 
              liberal, even progressive principals in his day. Like Hawthorne, an 
              anti-Puritan, Alcott helped abolitionists run an underground railroad.  
              He believed in open-minded education of the young, and decried fanatical 
              ways of rearing children in strict Puritanical obedience. He wanted 
              to allow them to question authority and communicate in a dialog of 
              learning. For his views, he suffered a measure of poverty which his 
              daughter had to endure, as portrayed in her popular novel, <i>Little 
              Women</i>.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Alcott and Hawthorne represent some 
              of the best of our American heritage,” said our tour guide, “They 
              were decent men, seeking truth, freedom and justice.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “But their ideas and books are not 
              what Americas export on a large scale these days,” I’d later told 
              the guide who’d given an edifying tour of Wayside along the road to 
              Concord.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Yup, few are hearing voices of writers 
              like Dickinson of Amherst or Hawthorne and Emerson of Concord compared 
              to Disney cartoons!” he’d quipped back.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Yeah, and even worse, compared to 
              the numbers out there seeing Hannibal the Cannibal — a monster who 
              tortures and eats people alive, especially sexy women. What can you 
              expect from a country which makes a multi-millionaire of that disgusting 
              sleaze-bag, Howard Stern?” I answered. “The students I teach never 
              heard of Linus Pauling, anti-nuclear physicist, or Jonas Salk, inventor 
              of Polio vaccine. And, I bet no one knows that 260 of America’s top 
              physicists have signed a pledge never to work on ‘Star Wars,’ because 
              its not a defensive but an offensive system meant to dominate outer 
              space and put a nuclear reactor up there by 2003 to power it!”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Lordy, I didn’t even hear of that 
              myself and I really read the papers. My God! But you ask those kids 
              who Madonna or Michael Jackson is and I bet you get a big response. 
              They know all about their underwear and sex lives, too!”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “For sure!” I laughed with him, but 
              my eyes watered as I walked away from Hawthorne’s house. I could imagine 
              that a fervent believer in Islamic principles would see my country 
              as Satan, given the crappy sensationalism it foisted upon the world, 
              the dirty and deprived sense of human sexuality that it exported everywhere, 
              the plastic, or fake-furred, Disney cartoon animals that never needed 
              to eat or defecate parading in pink and purple cartoons in place of 
              the real and the visceral, in the dreams of the misled young.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Well, thanks for taking good care 
              of my church!” I waved goodbye to the guide of Hawthorne’s Wayside 
              House as I pulled away. I couldn’t get the images of the rolling billowing 
              explosion, the bodies falling from the towers, out of my head.  I 
              felt exhausted and wished I had more of the ignorance which is bliss. 
              Then I, too, could have a good time waving the flag in the passionate 
              surge of American togetherness. “I feel so damned lonely,” I told 
              myself.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Stunned with pity for the dying inside 
              a burning Trade Center tower, I had watched from my roof as the second 
              gray jet buzzed low over my head up the East River, turned suddenly 
              at the Brooklyn Bridge, and smashed tons of exploding fuel into the 
              second tall tower. I hadn’t slept well since witnessing firsthand 
              the “Attack on America,” as CBS billed it.  With Hollywood slick red, 
              white and blue graphics and dramatic music, the networks showed that 
              explosion over and over again like a special effects movie, as America 
              was numbed out of its mind with thirst for war. Young men with baseball 
              caps atop their heads were shouting; “Nuke ’em!” with Howard Stern 
              in New York streets while Muslim women and children hid in their homes 
              afraid to </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">go out and shop for food. Some of us marched 
              in mournful peace demonstrations uniting our grief for the victims 
              of the attack and our fear for the future in a hope for a rational 
              reaction. Who did these baseball jocks think “’em” was? I knew “they” 
              were only civilians like those dead in my city, except they were the 
              poorest of earth’s poor. They were orphans crippled by land mines, 
              starving widows living amidst famine and drought in the rubble of 
              Afghanistan laid waste by the U.S. and USSR, who had fought their 
              Cold War — hot as Hell — there over the rich oil reserves of Caspian 
              Sea area. The two warring superpowers had pulled out leaving land 
              mines, starvation, </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">and mass graves everywhere. “They” were the subjects 
              of Taliban dictators who the U.S. military had supplied with weapons 
              and CIA know-how. “You’ve already had your vengeance on the Afghan 
              people,” I wanted to tell the base-ball caps. But it would have taken 
              a small dissertation to explain their own country’s foreign policy, 
              a rare subject in a nation entertaining itself to death on sitcoms, 
              sports, Disneyland dreams and opiates.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            With the image of the exploding towers 
              in my head, I lay awake nights listening to the jingoist slogans about 
              liberty and freedom as thousands of American workers festered in lingering 
              fires under tons of debris. My nightmares were full of their faces 
              mixed with the cries of a half-million Iraqi children starved as “collateral 
              damage” by U.S. trade sanctions. I thought of how my country, “land 
              of the free and home of the brave,” had been kicked off of the Human 
              Rights Council of the United Nations; how it had walked out of the 
              World Conference on Racism; how it had voted “No” to reparations for 
              the thousands of sexual slaves tortured by the Japanese military because 
              of fear of having to compensate the heirs of African slaves brutalized 
              here in the building of America. I thought of how the price of one 
              nuclear bomber would build thousands of ghetto schools. I thought 
              of how President George W. Bush had stepped out of the Kyoto Accord 
              on Global Warming. I thought of how Henry Kissinger had been pursued 
              in Paris to be tried at the Hague as a war criminal for his proven 
              part in the assassination of Salvador Allende and sundry other war 
              crimes that had caused the deaths of millions. This I’d read in a 
              lengthy article in <i>Harpers</i>, weeks earlier, carefully documented 
              with Henry Kissinger’s own papers, by Christopher Hitchens.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “The War on Terrorism” was staged 
              through my sleepless days as “Operation Infinite Justice.” Then it 
              was abruptly changed to “Operation Enduring Freedom,” because it was 
              pointed out that only God or Allah could wield “infinite” justice, 
              and such a title insulted the religious. The bombings, already killing 
              civilians and destroying a Red Cross hospital, had begun to conquer 
              “evil” and preserve “freedom.” I could not help knowing that the bombings 
              were meant to acquire control of the trillion dollar oil reserves 
              near the Caspian Sea. Professor Beeman at Brown University — who had 
              spent much time in Afghanistan — spelled that out in an article he’d 
              written for an anthropological website at the university. He explained 
              the plan to build a pipeline through Afghanistan to get the land-blocked 
              oil reserves out through Pakistan to the sea.  I knew, too, that bomb 
              building profits of GE, General Dynamics, Bechtell, Honeywell, Rand, 
              Hughes, AT &amp; T, Exxon, I.G. Farben, Standard Oil, Dupont, various 
              multi-national death dealers, were behind the war.  I regularly read 
              <i>The Defense Monitor</i>, a newsletter of The Center for Defense 
              Information in Washington, D.C., made up of retired, patriotic Navy 
              admirals and former nuclear submarine captains who were worriedly 
              educating Americans on the destructive waste of Pentagon budgets. 
              If you couldn’t believe retired brass about Pentagon waste and the 
              military industrial complex, who could you believe? I thought of “The 
              United Fruit Company,” Pablo Neruda’s poem which I’d translated from 
              the Spanish — a scenario in which workers are cooked in marmalade 
              in hideous sweat shops, and sold to be eaten by Superpower citizens 
              — apathetic in their consumerism.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            One night, I dreamed that Allende’s 
              weeping ghost, along with all the Chileans who were tortured or “disappeared” 
              under the despot Pinochet put in power by the CIA, were walking with 
              me like shades amidst the moans of thousands of mothers, husbands, 
              wives and fathers lying under the rubble of  the felled giant towers. 
              These were working people from every walk of life and culture snatched 
              from the moments of their lives. They expired calling on cell phones 
              to speak of love. Allende took my hand and led me through the rubble. 
              Then he sailed with me over the giant crater in the Pentagon and showed 
              me a basement room in the CIA, where anthrax was being prepared by 
              a psychotic, right-wing agent in an envelope destined for the office 
              of the Democratic Majority Leader. The idea was to cause a renewed 
              expansion of the CIA and embroil the legislature in another terrorist 
              attack, to make them vote right on a “Patriot’s Bill” that eroded 
              American freedoms, even as jingoists claimed we waged war for liberty. 
              Allende’s ghost accompanied me, like a guide from Dante’s Inferno, 
              to a Red Cross Hospital in Afghanistan where civilians lay under the 
              rubble bleeding. “These Afghan dead are just like my Chilean dead 
              and your American dead,” he said, “all innocent and murdered by the 
              same murderers.” I woke with the taste of petroleum oil burning in 
              my mouth, the smell of the jet oil fumes still permeating my bedroom 
              in the city.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Was I awake and dreaming or asleep 
              and living when I witnessed cheering hordes wave the bloodied red, 
              white and blue over the collapsed hot steel of Rockefeller’s big “edifice 
              complex” as it melted and continued to crumble? The too tall, death-traps 
              designed to implode sprayed human entrails throughout their steel 
              insides. Only the firemen and rescue workers trying to extract dismembered 
              bodies seemed like heroes. I thought of how a huge arsenal of nuclear 
              bombs can never protect an imperialist nation from the rage of box-cutters 
              and plastic penknives. I thought of the targets of the terrorists, 
              not The Statue of Liberty, symbol of freedom, but The Pentagon and 
              The World Trade Center, symbols of military and industrial might. 
              I thought of the huge demonstrations gathering strength among the 
              workers of the world who opposed the famines wrought by The World 
              Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Coincidentally, those mass 
              demonstrations uniting workers and environmental activists from all 
              over the world had been planned for the very month of September 2001. 
              When The World Trade Center had been attacked, they were cancelled. 
              I knew that bombs were not falling on Afghanistan to protect my freedom, 
              because the bombings were only encouraging more Islamic fundamentalists 
              to join the armies of the Taliban, destabilizing Pakistan, a shaky 
              nuclear power. The sorrow in me grew large and would not let me sleep. 
              Though I’d been an anti-nuclear activist for decades, this was a worry 
              bigger than I could handle.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            I could not join the crowds who bought 
              the major network “spin” on the story. Only the mourners with their 
              pitiful candles who lit my city’s nights seemed real to me. I knew 
              who owned CBS and NBC and it’s not the trade unions of our dead workers. 
              President Eisenhower had predicted the demise of my country’s democracy 
              to military technocracy. I knew that Mr. and Mrs. Dick Cheney had 
              recently sat on the board of Lockheed, which, during the anthrax scare, 
              with the legislature in disarray, was quickly awarded a two hundred 
              billion dollar contract to build a new line of jet bombers in the 
              midst of the aftermath and chaos of September 11th. I knew that letters 
              of protest during the anthrax scare would not reach legislatures. 
              I kept sending e-mail to my New York senators calling for an end to 
              the bombing, asking that United Nations troops be sent in to round 
              up the terrorists — according to the Geneva Accords. Though I mourned 
              our dead workers and the disruption of my home, and feared the threat 
              to my loved ones in my international city, I could not comfortably 
              join in the flag-waving in the streets. I felt very alone except for 
              the commiseration I had with a few friends I knew who read a great 
              deal about American foreign policy, too.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            It was ordinary New Yorkers like 
              me who died, as the sun swooned and the bright morning turned to a 
              smoky nightmare and ash kept falling over me in the streets. For weeks, 
              I choked on the ash of the budding hopes of these workers turned to 
              dust which coated my face and clothes, and wormed in the wind up my 
              nose. The burning smell was exactly, I imagined, like the dust of 
              bombed and burning Palestinian and Israeli bodies; hot ashes blasted 
              by Timothy McVeigh — blond blue-eyed American of the New Aryan Nation; 
              fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; napalm of Vietnam and bombs blasting 
              Cambodians; grenades of Granada and machine-gun smoke of East Timor. 
              Was it also like the fierce fire smell reported by astronauts, both 
              Russian and American, of infinite outer space in which we drifted 
              on our common earth, bound by one bright thirsty sun, ruled by one 
              magnetic moon, as we spun out and around caught in an eternally expanding 
              blast of stars on our dying, ecosystem composed of nearly all water? 
              This was the beginning of the 21st century as our huge war industries 
              continued to kill and bomb each other’s babies, mothers, fathers, 
              sisters, brothers in unending bloodbath of misery.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Irony of ironies, after devastating 
              so many poor countries from Vietnam to Nicaragua, Cambodia to Haiti, 
              the Philippines to Vietnam, the USSR and U.S. — arch Cold-War enemies 
              — were now teamed up with each other to profit from the trillion dollar 
              oil and natural gas reserves to be piped from the region of the Caspian 
              Sea. The American share would be sent through broken Afghanistan into 
              America’s huge tankers. I thought of Kissinger, safe in his New York 
              living room, while possibly as many as four thousand workers festered 
              beneath the rubble. He was seen on the network news calling smugly 
              for the deaths of terrorists as if he himself were not among the worst 
              of them.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            In my sweaty nightmares, the world 
              was toppling into agony, my lovely daughter and dying husband with 
              it, because people with “ordinary lives” are not vigilant, don’t find 
              time to know their own history when they vote — if their votes count 
              — persuaded by multi-million dollar commercials. My country was no 
              wiser than when Mark Twain and William James admonished Her for murdering 
              Filipinos and Teddy Roosevelt quipped: “The only good Filipino is 
              a dead Filipino!” — an analogous sentiment echoed over and over again 
              in the carnage of Haiti, Korea, South Africa, Vietnam, Granada, Iraq, 
              East Timor, Columbia, Afghanistan.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            But, who was Osama bin Laden really? 
              A devil invented by America’s family secret. The president’s dark 
              doppelganger?  I read an article by Giancarlo Radice from <i>The Evening 
              Courier of Italy</i>, September 22<sup>nd</sup>, translated by a professor 
              Kirschenbaum of Brown University, that Osama’s stepbrother, Salem, 
              had been a chief investor in Bush W’s first business venture, a Texas 
              oil company called Arbusto. This was corroborated by <i>The Wall Street 
              Journal</i>. Salem bin Laden, the European press reported, had died 
              in a mysterious plane crash in Texas, just as his father Muhammad 
              bin Laden had in his days dealing in oil and drugs in Texas. Was Osama 
              a devil, double-crossed and sculpted from the spare rib of a world 
              laid to waste by America’s gunboat diplomacy, vastly polluting nuclear 
              arsenal, “full-spectrum dominance,” chilling disregard for non-American 
              lives, barbarous military interventions, support for despotic regimes, 
              and its merciless economic agenda that has munched through the economies 
              of poor countries like a ravenous rat?  Its marauding multinationals 
              had, over the air we breathe, the ground we stand on, the water we 
              need to live, the thoughts we think?  I thought how odd it was that 
              television was debuting a new dramatic series titled, <i>The Agency</i>, 
              about the CIA, which made its agents into great heroes risking their 
              lives in the defense of America, the very week after the disaster 
              of September 11th.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            The twin terrorists, Bush and bin 
              Laden, were blurring into one another in my mind.  I realized from 
              my reading, they were becoming interchangeable. Their guns, bombs, 
              money and drugs had been going around international loops for years 
              together. The Stinger missiles that shot at U.S. helicopters were 
              supplied by the CIA. The heroin used by America’s drug addicts, traded 
              for guns, comes from Afghanistan, the fruits of a drug industry encouraged 
              by the CIA. The Bush Administration recently gave the Taliban a 43-million-dollar 
              subsidy for a “war on drugs,” which would buy more profits for guns 
              for multi-national weapons dealers. I knew that my country was the 
              biggest arms dealer in the world, and that Russia came in second on 
              that score and was just as evil. The two Cold-War Superpowers had 
              amassed large arsenals of bio-terrorism, too, during the Cold War. 
              KGB agents and CIA agents had traded all sorts of spying back and 
              forth until no one knew for sure who were the spies and who the counter-spies 
              and that, no doubt, the same sort of intrigue had gone on in Central 
              Asia during the Afghan wars. I was told by a Russian soldier who had 
              fought in them that the military was riddled with heroin-addicted 
              men.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Osama bin Laden, I learned as I read 
              unable to sleep, was an Afghan veteran who fought valiantly in the 
              front lines against the Russians for the U.S. He spent his family 
              fortune subsidizing the veterans of that war, and their widows and 
              orphans. He broke with the Saudi crown of his homeland in an argument 
              over U.S. intrusion into Central Asia’s Holy Lands. Osama — first 
              trained as a business man who switched his studies to Islam — had 
              been the only son of the big bin Laden clan to fight with the Taliban 
              on the American side. He’d become legendary among the Taliban for 
              his generous aid to the deserted veterans of the Afghan wars after 
              the Americans pulled out, leaving the country in ruin and giving nothing 
              to build their promise of freedom from Communism. Osama was a six-foot-seven 
              devote believer who walked like a king of mercy among the veterans’ 
              families of Afghanistan dispensing alms from his family’s fortunes. 
              Many Islamic extremists thought of him as a Christ “turning over the 
              tables of money changers” when he bombed The World Trade Center. He 
              was the only rich son to have fought in the front lines among the 
              starving soldiers. He was a fringe cult-figure of the despotic Taliban 
              who controlled their countrymen and the Afghan women with murderous 
              military powers bestowed upon them by the United States.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            The cruelties toward women were unspeakably 
              extreme on the part of the despotic Taliban. Thinking of Afghan widows 
              buried alive in mass graves, and women stoned to death for not wearing 
              their veils or for imagined or real sexual transgressions, added to 
              my nightmares. Osama was also the stepbrother and son of Salem and 
              Muhammad, who once hobnobbed with the oil barons of Texas society 
              before dying in unexplained airplane crashes there — at about the 
              time of the Iran-Contragate scandals. I remembered, too, an article 
              I’d read about Sadaam Hussein seeing his father shot by Westerners 
              before his own eyes when he was a boy of five. I wondered at what 
              psychological aberrations, what private vendettas, had helped to create 
              these two fanatical Frankensteins: Sadaam of Iraq, and Osama of Saudi 
              Arabia and Afghanistan.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            I thought about George Bush, Jr., 
              too. He seemed like a personable, not-to-bright guy, who loved baseball 
              and really would rather not be president — if only being a baseball 
              team manager would have satisfied Dad. He was a typical “frat boy” 
              who had married a librarian. Laura Bush, I read in <i>Newsweek</i>, 
              was a woman who had killed her classmate when she ran a stop sign, 
              ramming his car with hers and breaking his neck. For this old crime 
              committed when she was seventeen, she’d never gone to prison, but 
              served a little community service instead. Had she been a drinker 
              like George W. had been? Had they helped each other to give up alcohol?  
              I knew that he’d been chosen by his father, a former CIA director, 
              and a wealthy political machine to grab the U.S. election in Texas. 
              He came into office just in time to seal the about-to-be-made public 
              Reagan/Bush presidential papers with a presidential order claiming 
              “national security reasons.” He was an ignorant puppet who had never 
              traveled abroad, who self-admittedly didn’t like to read, who was 
              funded by a powerful oil lobby more than any other president had been. 
              The pharmaceutical giants were behind him, too. That I understood 
              from John Loftus of the Holocaust Museum in Florida, a former U.S. 
              Prosecuting Attorney for Nazi war criminals, who was quoted as saying: 
              “The Bush family fortune comes from The Third Reich.” I.G. Farben, 
              the big German financial corporation, had built the Bush and Rockefeller 
              profits during World War II. According to <i>The Encyclopedia Britannica,</i> 
              I.G. Farben financed the building of forty death camps, including 
              Auschwitz.  I.G. Farben had morphed into investments in the big pharmaceutical 
              corporations now invested in the Genome project. Those same pharmaceutical 
              giants were scalping our senior citizens for the drugs that keep them 
              alive and scalping AIDS victims with medication prices beyond their 
              pocket books. Giant pharmaceutical firms were destined to profit, 
              too, from the new bio-terror threat sweeping my city and spreading 
              throughout America.  Now the military industrial puppet of oil and 
              nuclear barons, George W. Bush, and double-crossed Osama, Frankenstein 
              of the CIA,  were faced off in a tragic comedy of “blow-back.” The 
              people of my city were dead and my family threatened, as each borrowed 
              the other’s rhetoric. Each referred to the other as “the head of the 
              snake.” Both invoked God and used the loose currency of good and evil 
              as their terms of reference. Both were engaged in unequivocal war 
              crimes. Both were dangerously armed as they stalked my nightmares, 
              one with the nuclear arsenal of the obscenely powerful, the other 
              with the incandescent, self-destructive power of the utterly hopeless.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            On September 29th, I sat alone over 
              a bowl of New England clam chowder at a busy lunch counter in Concord 
              Village — the seat of American transcendentalism. Even after enjoying 
              my tour of the Hawthorne house, Wayside, sorrow and disorientation 
              still pummeled my spirit with a feeling I’d no right to be happy, 
              to enjoy my soup or the sunshine. That sensation combined with a fear 
              I’d never feel safe again in my city, living just five minutes across 
              from Wall Street in </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Brooklyn, as I had for thirty years. Worse, I’d 
              never feel my daughter was safe working and commuting through the 
              subways, tunnels or over the bridges.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            I looked at the map I’d placed on 
              the counter next to my soup to check the route that would take me 
              across the Berkshire mountains from Concord to Greenfield. It looked 
              narrow and winding. I had only a couple of hours to get to my destination 
              before dark. A young man and a blond child had just seated themselves 
              to my right and ordered chowder. The young man looked alert and his 
              young daughter with her long hair seemed well cared for. She smiled 
              up at me. I smiled back.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Excuse me, do you happen to know 
              about this road across the mountains to Greenfield. Does it take very 
              long to make it to Route 91?”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “About two hours or more. It’s a 
              beautiful road on an autumn day like this,” he replied.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “So, it’s a real highway? Easy driving. 
              Not a lot of lights?”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Two lanes, a few traffic lights, 
              and you’ll need sunglasses, because the sunset is coming right at 
              you. There’s no better view of the fall foliage right now though.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Thanks, I appreciate your advice. 
              I’m from New York City and don’t know these parts well. I was just 
              visiting Hawthorne’s Wayside House.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “We were visiting Walden Pond,” her 
              father offered. “Nice and peaceful there.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “You’re from New York City where 
              the attacks happened? Gosh, did you see them?” His daughter’s big 
              blue eyes implored a thorough answer</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Yes, I saw them from my rooftop 
              close by. I live in the tallest building just across from lower Manhattan 
              on the East River.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Oh, it must have been terrible to 
              see! Did anybody you know get hurt?” Her father wanted to be sensitive 
              about the point.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “No, but my daughter was having surgery 
              in the midst of the chaos. That was really the harrowing part for 
              me, though she’s okay now. I saw the second grey jet buzz in over 
              my head up the East River, turn at the bridge, and smash into the 
              towers with a big explosion. Debris and ashes rained down on me, but 
              I'm okay.” When I see his daughter looking at me in wonder, I hasten 
              to add: “But most people in the world are good people. There are only 
              a few very bad ones who do things like that. I’m sure you are safe 
              up here in New England.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “I know everybody in our town. We 
              all know each other and feel safe there and our teacher said that 
              not all Muslims are bad people, only a few who call themselves Muslims 
              and are really just crazy criminals. There are lots of Muslims everywhere 
              in the world, just like us,” she offered with enthusiasm. “One of 
              the kids on our school is Islamic and she seems just like us, too.” 
              Her good cheer was palpable and her vocabulary bright.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Well, you sound like a very smart 
              girl. How old are you, may I ask?”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “I’m nine. My name is Meagan and 
              I come from Stowe, Vermont.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “I’m sixty. My name’s Daniela, and 
              I come from New York City. Pleased to meet you, Meagan. I was just 
              enjoying seeing Nathaniel Hawthorne’s house. He was a good man opposed 
              the fanatical ways of Puritans. It sounds like your teacher is giving 
              you a lesson against extreme ideas.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “I love my teacher. She’s always 
              telling us not to be prejudice. This spring we studied the underground 
              railroad for escaping slaves. We made believe we were running one 
              in our class, and I played a slave. I got to feel how scary it is 
              to hide and worry that you will be caught and put in chains and made 
              to do all the hard, dirty work for other people who have good stuff 
              to eat when you don’t have anything to eat at all. The slave masters 
              got to eat cookies during recess and the slaves had to hide in the 
              cellar and got none. We traded places the next week. The masters had 
              to play slaves and they got nothing. Only Mrs. Stein says it was even 
              much worse because they were actually beaten and starved and couldn’t 
              get to know their mothers or fathers. They couldn’t even have a family 
              name or go to school or anything. Mrs. Stein thinks African-American 
              communities should have re-par-ations to build better libraries and 
              schools.” Meagan’s earnest innocence touched me.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “I’m so glad you’re learning all 
              those things in school. I just learned about the underground railroad 
              at Hawthorne’s Wayside house which was run there by Louisa May Alcott’s 
              father. She wrote<i> Little Women</i>, about some smart American girls 
              like you.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Oh, I like that book. My Mom read 
              it with me last summer. Dad, can we go see that house next time we 
              come down here, please?”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Sure,” her father answered, used 
              to pleasing her. “If you want to.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Was it where she lived when she 
              wrote that book?” Meagan asked me.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Oh, yes, she wrote it right there 
              at Wayside House when her father was having difficulty with money 
              because people didn’t agree with his ideas. He had ideas that children 
              should have recess time and be allowed to ask questions when they 
              learn. Some Puritanical extremists thought that was a terrible idea. 
              You can see the staircase where Louisa played with her sisters. And 
              the room she lived in, mentioned in the book. You can see the desk 
              in the attic where Hawthorne wrote.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “We have recess everyday and our 
              teacher is always asking us if we have any questions about stuff. 
              We saw Walden Pond. Daddy says Thoreau was a nature writer. He lived 
              there and swam there and planted a garden.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Yes, he started the great national 
              park movement with his essay on hiking through the wilderness. He 
              was really good at appreciating nature, but not so good at knowing 
              that women and girls can be just as smart as men and boys. He thought 
              our brains were smaller, but you’re living proof he was wrong.” I 
              smiled at her father and he nodded.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Do you think Global Warming can 
              be stopped? My Mom says there are lots of people working to stop it 
              around the world. Dad says it won’t come to Stowe, Vermont, to make 
              floods as soon as it will to the coastlines.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Yes, there are lots of people working 
              to stop it, and you are safer in Stowe, but, unfortunately, the president 
              we have now isn’t very helpful about that.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “We have to get a better president 
              who cares about children and their future on earth, Mom says,” Meagan 
              answered with characteristic earnestness.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “We need one who doesn’t drop bombs 
              on civilians, but really weeds out the terrorists with diplomacy and 
              intelligence,” her Dad answered.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Dad, what’s diplomacy?” Meagan asked.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “A way for nations to talk things 
              over instead of make war.” Her father answered with his daughter with 
              patience. </p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “That sounds better than war, for 
              sure,” she answered. “You know,” she looked at me sadly, “September 
              11th was my birthday! Those attacks on America kinda spoiled my party.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “September 11th was your birthday?” 
              My soup was finished and I had to be on the road.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “September 11th every year is my 
              birthday,” she sighed with irony.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            And, I don’t know why my eyes welled 
              up when I told her:  “I’m so glad you told me that because every year 
              when September 11th comes around, I’m going to remember that it’s 
              Meagan’s birthday. That will make me happier every year.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Thanks,” she said, waving goodbye 
              as I thanked her father again for his travel advice. “Remember your 
              sunglasses!” Meagan called after me.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “I will and I'll never forget that 
              September 11th is your birthday. Never! Wherever you are, wherever 
              I am, I’ll be wishing Meagan a happy birthday on September 11th every 
              year for the rest of my life.”</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            “Thanks,” she said smiling, and giving 
              a little wave goodbye.</p>
            
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">             I turned so she couldn’t see the tears 
          beginning to ooze from my tired eyes. I felt a lot better thinking of 
          her as I drove over the Berkshires, wearing my sunglasses, viewing in 
          awe the gorgeous foliage of those New England mountains glowing orange 
          and red in the sunlight.</p>
