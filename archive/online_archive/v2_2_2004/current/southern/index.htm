              it certain that a true poet occupies a place? Is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 
              poet not that which, in the eminent sense of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 
              term, <i>loses place</i>, ceases occupation, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;precisely, 
              and is thus the very opening of space . . . 
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Emmanuel Levinas<span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is a tie that 
              binds us to our Homes”</p>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— slogan on Squeezers Playing Cards</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Identifying Southern women poets of innovative 
              persuasion and showcasing their work in <i>HOW2</i> has been full 
              of pleasures and surprises. It was exciting to receive contributions 
              from poets whose work I’ve admired for years, as well as to come 
              to know the work of so many accomplished poets previously unknown 
              to me. In one of the more delightful twists in the editorial process, 
              I knew some of the poets from various websites — but because cyberspace 
              sometimes obscures places of origin, I hadn’t a clue that these 
              poets were fellow Southerners living in neighboring states. She’s 
              one of us! I’d think, feeling a warm glow of regional solidarity.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I limited the collection to poets currently 
              living in the South. This excluded poets who spent their formative 
              years here, or even produced mature work here, but who have since 
              moved to other parts of the country. For example, Lee Ann Brown 
              and Harryette Mullen grew up in Southern states, but are now living 
              and writing in New York and Los Angeles, respectively. Perhaps some 
              day there will be a collection of experimental Southern expatriate 
              poets. In the meantime, part of my purpose here is to identify women 
              experimental poets who are living in relatively close proximity 
              to one another. I hope that the process of introducing them to each 
              other — as well as to a larger audience — will encourage communication 
              and generate collaborations, readings, and publications.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Because of the efforts of New Orleans poet 
              and publisher Bill Lavender in finding and gathering cutting-edge 
              Southern poets, we are eagerly anticipating the appearance of our 
              first anthology, <i>Another South: Experimental Writing of the South</i> 
              (University of Alabama Press, 2002). This collection features the 
              work of poets living in flourishing poetry communities, as well 
              as those writing in more isolated pockets of vibrant activity.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For example, communities of innovative poets 
              have during the past decade or so been coalescing in places such 
              as Atlanta, New Orleans, Austin, and Pensacola. Poets in these cities 
              are organizing readings such as the Back Door Poets series in Pensacola, 
              Lit City in New Orleans, and the series organized by Hoa Nguyen 
              and Dale Smith in Austin. The Atlanta Poetry Group has for years 
              gathered on a weekly basis to share work and plan collaborative 
              projects, and it recently launched a reading series. Longstanding 
              and new publishers regularly featuring innovative poetry include 
              presses such as Lavender Ink, Skanky Possum and Runaway Spoon, and 
              magazines such as <i>Brown Box</i>, <i>Skanky Possum</i>, <i>Fell 
              Swoop</i>, <i>Baddog</i>, <i>Holy Tomato</i>, <i>Exquisite Corpse</i>, 
              <i>Mundane Egg</i>, <i>Verse</i>, <i>Lit City Broadside Series</i>, 
              <i>Mudlark</i>, <i>Veer</i>, <i>Mesechabe</i>, and <i>108.</i> This 
              incomplete list indicates an abundance of publishing and reading 
              projects among Southern avant-garde poets.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I love living in the South, but as an innovative 
              poet I have sometimes felt remote from the meccas of experimental 
              poetry in the West and Northeast. But to whom are “outlying districts” 
              (to borrow a title from Anselm Hollo) “outlying”? Not to ourselves, 
              who make our lives in a place and create our poetry from experience, 
              and who know intimately the “tie that binds us to our homes,” notwithstanding 
              all the poststructuralist theory in the world. For some poets in 
              the present collection, place has marked their work with relatively 
              few, if any, giveaway accents or landscapes. But to conclude that 
              their work doesn’t partake in the local is perhaps to succumb to 
              stereotypes of place, for these poets are as keenly aware of their 
              experience on a local level as those poets whose Southernness is 
              more recognizable. The poets in this collection who pointedly address 
              Southern experience acknowledge place as a daily, lived experience 
              and also complicate it so as to empty it of its worn, nostalgic 
              and harmful categories. They explore the rich fluidities and open 
              boundaries of their local experience. Their poetry is no mere exercise 
              in updated local color and mythology, but rather an astute interrogation 
              of the local in order to expose its solidities, its pluralities, 
              and its absurdities. The South has no identity. It also has many 
              identities, all provisional.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lastly, I want to ponder the extent to which 
              the poets assembled here are part of a community of Southern poets 
              with something in common besides our nominal home. After all, the 
              South is, from the start, an extraordinarily diverse region geographically 
              and culturally. Are our only discernible commonalities our increasingly 
              distant Confederate past and our eternal heat and humidity? In what 
              ways are we still haunted by the specter of the Mason-Dixon line? 
              If we consider ourselves to be Southern poets in an other-than-geographical 
              sense, in what ways? Sometimes it takes an indigenous Southerner 
              like Evie Shockley to reveal the linguistic richness as well as 
              the dangerous mindsets that arise from Southern cultures. And sometimes 
              it takes a transplant to make us see afresh the peculiarly neurotic 
              or eccentric voices and social relations around us, as in California 
              native Jessica Freeman’s sharply satirical exposés of Southern denizens.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The work of Southern experimental poets needs 
              to be seen as both an internally diverse phenomenon in its own right 
              and also part of a larger movement within national and international 
              poetry communities. In this sense, “The South” is a borderless region, 
              a shape-shifting state of mind and mythology. Its innovative poets 
              are, in their otherness, “dug in”; they are simultaneously native 
              and exiled in their own homeland, whether they were born to that 
              homeland or chose it. Sometimes they mimick and borrow in order 
              to celebrate or scandalize. And for Southern poets who carry to 
              other parts of the world a pinch of red, black or beige soil under 
              their nails, “Southern” is a movable and malleable accent.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Coexisting alongside the dialogue with place 
              and experience among the featured poets is the ongoing and vital 
              dialogue with innovative poetry of other regions and nationalities. 
              We have both our Mina Loys, quintessentially cosmopolitan yet writing 
              trenchantly about the places they inhabit, and our Lorine Niedeckers, 
              living in relative isolation, yet acutely cognizant of their contemporaries.</p>
            <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I’m delighted to present to <i>HOW2</i> readers 
              these eleven poets in all their plurality of approaches and voices. 
              I hope you’ll find here, as I did, many surprises and much pleasure 
              in the grittiness, humor, lyricism, edginess, and <i>native otherness</i> 
              of these poets.</p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><b><span lang=EN-AU>Acknowledgments</span></b><span
