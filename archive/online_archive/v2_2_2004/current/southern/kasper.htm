        revitalized by my younger sister’s botanical art works. The visual aspects

          <div class=Section1> In the morning, she walks into the room and opens 
            the blinds.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1>That nothing happens by chance, but all things occur 
            from<br>
            necessity, even though necessity is difficult to admit.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> She poured ice water from the pitcher into the 
            glass and noticed the pleasing <br>
            sound of the glass becoming full.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> There are several firelit worlds and our insistence 
            on one tells us more about our selves than the universe.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> There was a window in the room, but opening was 
            not allowed.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> That the cause of a new act [or thing], or something 
            new produced depends on if <br>
            you are standing barefoot or wearing shoes, and who does the lifting.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>That the table on which you set your glass, which sits in the direct 
          line of the sun, <br>
          can be turned.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> A potentially hazardous solar flare leapt from 
            the sun Thursday.  Some suggest <br>
            the planet is overdue for another one.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> At the time of the solar maximum, if left out all 
            day, the feather will fill with dirt <br>
            and wind.  Across the film it will leave a speckled line.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> When you write, speckled line, you curve the letters, 
            and squinting, see sun spots.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> We said we felt no consequences from the solar 
            flares, as the tides rose and the <br>
            rivers fell back, and the drought came upon our flesh.  When the itching 
            began, <br>
            we envisioned grasshoppers.  When the wounds broke open, we saw worms.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> The bird had fallen and someone recorded it a book 
            about West Nile, another bird <br>
            fell and was counted.  In the grass, we found the bloody feathers.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> There was water in the glass, but it couldn’t be 
            drunk.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> She stood up and went to the window.  She could 
            feel the cold of the glass <br>
            against her cheek, even though the sky appeared to be bright.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> The poles of the sun’s magnetic field have apparently 
            reversed.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> Several powerful solar salvos are heading toward 
            earth where they could cause <br>
            another round of dazzling auroras and disrupt radio communications.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> We watched her stand there, wondering what she 
            could have been thinking.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> Suffocation was a single word intended, but unspoken, 
            left out for someone to <br>
            guess.  Suffocation was the presumption there was one single answer, 
            an answer <br>
            at all.  It was an infinite question that held no water.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> A shadow emerged from the glass as shadows spontaneously 
            generate from <br>
            objects immersed in light.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> We watched the water rings evaporate on the surface 
            of the table.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> At the peak of an eleven-year cycle of activity, 
            the sun has become increasingly stormy.  Prisms are born from fragrant 
            thunderstorms.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> Sun’s storms may or may not cause lightning in 
            the southern hemisphere of the <br>
            brain, static behind the eyes, hence, sun stroke.  Storms have intensified 
            <br>
            nighttime aurora light shows.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> She appeared to disappear into a blinding glare.  
            Someone spoke about taking a <br>
            photograph.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> There was so much sunlight; we were composed of 
            shadow.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> When she left the room, we had the impression she 
            remained somehow, both <br>
            leaving the room and remaining, as thought the dust particles illuminated 
            by the <br>
            sun’s rays contained the inner workings of her ears.  They danced 
            around us, <br>
            perhaps recording our words on infinitesimal microchips.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> To look back is to romanticize, to comb the mind 
            with honey.  The honeyed sun <br>
            attracts bees to its warm hive.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> The paper was exposed and the comb’s white teeth 
            bled against dark blue.  The <br>
            sun will cause an object to change into its opposite, it will cause 
            blue glass to <br>
            crack.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> To look forward is to fantasize, to invent phantoms 
            where those who walk on the <br>
            other side of the sun have not yet been followed.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> Exposed, the chlorophyll shivered for a moment 
            from the heat.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> “coronal mass ejections, filled with billions of 
            tons of radiation and ionized<br>
            particles” / misquoted: “the alternative sun shown nothing on the 
            new”<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> To look in front of you is to realize; it also 
            prevents you from falling, as sunny-<br>
            side up, the egg is free to stare at its immanent consumption.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> The dry intensity of her stare was said to burn, 
            sear, scar the observer, who too, <br>
            stood watching, blind-sighted.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> The hottest heat of a flame is blue; the oceans 
            burn more ferociously than the sun.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> On that afternoon, sweat dropped across the shadow, 
            and the glass, surrounded by<br>
            shadow moved imperceptibly.<br>
            <br>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> We left our fingerprints there, on the moistened 
            tabletop, glassy beads dripping <br>
            onto the carpet.<br>
            <br>
          </div>

        <li> 
          <div class=Section1> The higher altitude, the more difficult it is to 
            breathe.  In the lungs, the heat <br>
            photosynthesizes, the breath comes out in luminary song.<br>

          <div class=Section1> We replaced her in her room.  We mirrored the minor
