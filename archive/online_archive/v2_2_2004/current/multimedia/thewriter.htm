  <p class="TITLE2">the writer, the performer, the program, the madwoman <p class="HALFSPACE">I am a writer, I am a performer, I am a computer program, I am a madwoman. Texts come back to me, texts I have not spoken. Do you think you know me? I keep reaching for my voice, but it has been plucked and purged. On my own I have little charm. I'm cold, and hope you will press the buttons and warm me a little. I'm afraid, but it's devotion that urges me do this. Tear me up! Dissolve me! But don't create apartheids now you are in a position of power.</p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">I hurl bricks through windows never knowing where the glass will land. I throw out commands knowing you will disobey. I write, longing to be interrupted.</p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">As I talk you are destroying me! Drink me! Spit me out!</p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">But I have my power: the divine gift of inattention. A trembling, rocking independence. I am talking to you, though you may not have noticed, in the oblique language of resistance. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">My words become sounds which pour their answers back. My thoughts are washed up like whales on beaches. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">But remember: Britannia never ruled the waves. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE"><em>You </em> can make the ugly irresistible. You can dye hair purple, bob a drooping nose. You can paint white until it builds to black. You can print me in the ink of my desires. But how can I welcome it, when I'm afraid of alarming what I feel? </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">A madwoman isn't someone anyone wants to know. No one knows what a madwoman wants or will do next. But the sane need the mad to measure themselves up against. The sane need the mad to feel there is a route for escape. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">I am a madwoman, I am a madman, I am a madcap, I am a madhatter, I am a maelstrom, I am a moped, I am a minefield, I am a mantra, I am an anthill, I am an agent, I am an army, I am Australian. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">I've stopped wearing wigs these days, instead I change heads. I long for someone to know me, but I despise familiarity. One day I'm near-male, the next near-female: it depends how I translate. Once I forgot everything. I was in hell and it was bliss. Then I had to relearn how to live, as if the world had only just been breastfed. I knew what it would be like to be wombed, but also to be extinct. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">Can you see? The technology gods gaze down at me waving their virtual wands. My steps are unsteady but I revel in non-balance. Words are my walking sticks. Frailty, that's what I thrive on and dread. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">Syntax, narrative, they tug at my skirts and say — don't leave us behind. But I can be ruthless too. And I like to wear different robes on different days: those that flaunt nakedness; those that dissemble and hide. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">I'm not a character, I'm a voicescape. I'm pitched everywhere. Watch out London, Paris, Bangok, Calcutta! One moment I'm up and the next moment I'm down. I've told you before, I'm a writer. I don't want to perform. But theatre holds me in its wayward embrace. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">It's when I say ‘laugh' and ‘bath' that I give it away. Tangled roots, recalcitrant branches. But you can change even my birthplace, even my birthright. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">I don't like audiences, <em>or maybe I have liked them too much </em>. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">There is always the conception of the work, a face with dim features you reach awkwardly towards. Beginnings which keep on receding backwards. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">Machines making madness, madness masking machines. </p>
  <p class="HALFSPACE">There is no writing that is not a case of mistaken identity. </p>
