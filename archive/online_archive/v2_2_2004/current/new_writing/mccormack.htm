<p><b>This brief statement is not an essay, rather it
contextualizes my thinking through the oeuvre of Gins and Arakawa and  is 
intended as an accompaniment to my poems written as a response to <i>Reversible
Destiny</i>. </b></p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">The architectural projects of Madeline Gins and Arakawa served as
my introduction to innovative architectural practice in the late 1990s, and
just as their work isn’t without precedents the endeavours of other architects
should further contextualize their realized and proposed projects.</p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">One of these is Claude Parent whose proposal (with Paul Virillio)
in the 1960s of “inclined planes,” or the oblique, meant that “The foundation
of life was not neutral any longer but active, and the disruption caused by the
inclined plane could not be misunderstood since it was addressed to obvious
human attitudes like balance and imbalance (stability, instability, shift of
references) It used indisputable means of direct information such as tactility.
The non-coded ‘foot’ and the non-coded ‘hand’ also became foremost and
unquestionable information sources and superseded the eye and the logical
intelligence, which are considered usual filters of the understanding of
space.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">Parent goes on to state that he “. . . continually reasserted that
the oblique was not an architecture proposing a new language, but rather a
tool. This approach always prompts fresh issues to be raised, leading to the
discovery of new solutions and relations to the space, and finally creation of
new spaces which would have been unimaginable through traditional methods of
creation.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp;In the 1990s Gins and Arakawa similarly assert: “Architecture is a
tool that can be used as writing has been, except that it can have a far more
extensive range of application.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> For them, “The task of architecture is to
mete out the world in such a way that it might be reflected on body-wide. And
what does thinking — global body-wide thinking — need? Thinking surely needs
perseverance in the matter at hand, the continual pursuing of that which
perplexes, a coming at it and to it from all sides.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a></p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">In his <i>Digital Dreams </i>(2000) Neil Spiller takes us
literally within and beyond the body-as-tool in architecture:</span></p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">“Recent tissue engineering successes with growing bone cultures
could quite easily cause bone to become one of the new structural materials.
The murky blanket of the body is being understood, unwrapped and rewrapped.
This reconditioning of the body influences architecture, as it is this wet and
leaking blanket that is our sensitive channel through which we ‘receive’
architecture.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a></p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">Spiller asserts that in the future architects “will have
nanoengineering at their disposal . . . The mechanical and the organic will be
reconciled by the transformation of the <i>prima materia</i> of architecture
and alchemy: space. Subtle manipulations of space at an atomic level will
produce astounding changes at higher scales. This will influence human
perception itself.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a></p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">While Gins and Arakawa design architectural surrounds that will
ostensibly transform human perception, Spiller’s claim is for nanotechnology to
enact such transformative capabilities. Spiller is acutely aware of the ethical
implications of the ideas he puts forward:</span></p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">“Amazing advances in biotechnology have revealed an intricate
world of proteins and genes the manipulation of which is fraught with ethical
quandaries.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> and again, “With such a power we immediately have to negotiate a
series of ethical positions that were previously academic. For example, how
smart does a building have to get before it has rights and moral obligations?
Or, what is the philosophical status of objects sculptured and cultured in
flesh?”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a></p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">To my knowledge Gins and Arakawa have not addressed such concerns
in their published work.</span></p>

<p class="DOUBLESPACE">Certainly innovative architects propose welcome antidotes to much
of the existent architecture comprising our experience. The fact that there are
degrees of innovation is one we should never lose sight of and  it is important
to recognize that Gins and Arakawa’s proposals are part of a <i>collective </i>provocation
that continues to unfold in varying degrees of radicality throughout the 20th
century, from Matta Echaurren to Constant through Claude Parent to Neil
Spiller, now into the 21st century.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> Every aspect of this collective challenge
is accompanied by individual levels and issues of unease. It is our ongoing
responsibility to ensure that ethical considerations are part of the
determining process, and it’s not only in architecture that we<i> </i>must
question the proposed innovations we<i> </i> might choose to live within.</p>

<a href="#_ednref9" name="_edn9" title="">[9]</a> Some of these would include Constant’s “labyrinth houses”  . .
. “consisting of a large number of rooms of irregular form, stairs at angles,
lost corners, open spaces, culs-de-sac . . . provide places of adventure.” (Anthony Vidler, <i>The Architectural Uncanny</i>, Cambridge: MIT, 1992, p
213), hereafter referred to as <i>AU.</i>  There is also Matta Echaurren’s
“intrauterine” design for an apartment dedicated to the senses, published in <i>Minotaure</i> 11, in 1938, which was a deliberate attack on the commonplaces of the bourgeois
home. The perspective view shows materials and forms that merge nature and the
inorganic, the mathematical and the tactile. It was, Matta noted, “a space that
will bring into consciousness human verticality.” A true vertigo machine,
composed of “different levels, a stair without a handrail to overcome the
void,” it was also a space of psychological interaction. Its columns were
“psychological Ionic”; its furnishings “supple, pneumatic.” Matta specified
inflatable rubber, cork, paper, and plaster for the soft areas, all for better
contrast, framed in an “armature of rational architecture.” (Matta Echaurren,
“Mathématique sensible—Architecture du temps”, adaptation by Georges Hugnet, <i>Minotaure</i> 11, 1938, p 43.  Also Vidler, <i>AU</i>, p. 153).  Other examples are Reyner
Banham and François Dallegret’s “The Environment Bubble” (<i>Art in America</i>,
no. 53, April 1965. and in Simon Sadler, <i>The Situationist City</i>,
Cambridge: MIT, 1998, p 39), hereafter referred to as <i>SC</i>; Michael
Webb’s “Cuschicle” for Archigram 1966–1967, a “complete nomadic unit” (Sadler, <i>SC</i>,
p 136); and a helicoidal house noted by Guy-Ernest Debord in “Théorie de la dérive,” (<i>Les lèvres nues</i>, no. 9, Brussels, p 156), who admired its flexibility,
and which was “presumably based in turn on Bruce Goff’s extraordinary Bavinger
House, Norman, Oklahoma, 1950–1955. The building combined the baroque, Frank
Lloyd Wright-ish form beloved by the situationists with a daring suspended
structural system of the type adopted by New Babylon’s Hanging Sector,
amplifying aspects of the work of Buckminster Fuller, such as his Dymaxion House,
1927.” (Sadler, <i>SC</i>, fn. p 103, p 193).  “Constant embraced the idea,
envisaging a system of movable partitions within a fixed framework.” (Sadler, <i>SC</i>,
p 132, cf. Gins’ &amp; Arakawa’s Ponge-inspired snail house in <i>AB</i> pp
33–46).</p>
