      <P CLASS="TITLE1">&#8220;Collision Leaking Species&#8221;</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2"><B>by Kate Fagan</B></P>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">The phrase &#8220;collision leaking species&#8221; 
          appears in several panels of Maggie O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s provocative 
          work <em>murmur</em>, a sequence of text-based artworks and collages 
          excerpted in this issue&#8217;s <strong>Work/book </strong>section. 
          As its title suggests, <em>murmur</em> is a graphic and partial account 
          of what remains unaccountable and, in some way, unaccounted for: material 
          whispers, the mechanics of an earthly undercarriage, iterations or ruptures 
          occurring at a heart level &#8212; barely discernible by some readings 
          and catastrophic by others. Category is torn open in O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s 
          work, as formal fragments permute through a complex series of operations 
          and terrains. <em>murmur</em> is a work made for wall and floor, to 
          be shifted about, as O&#8217;Sullivan explains to Dell Olsen in an interview 
          to accompany the feature. It literalizes a step <em>off</em> the page 
          and into physical space, while acknowledging in its primary textiles 
          (A4 pages) the plastic, flexible and pervasive temper of writing media. 
          As O&#8217;Sullivan says, <em>murmur</em> develops the poetic work as 
          &#8220;a multidimensional, kinaesthetic, sentient terrain or environment 
          for the body to enter and move through.&#8221; It is a form of &#8220;social 
          sculpture&#8221; (Joseph Beuys), powerful in rejecting aesthetics of 
          neatly commodified sameness: &#8220;fabricators of canons don&#8217;t 
          want awkwardnesses.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="Doublespace">Our <strong>Spring 2004</strong> edition of <em>How2</em> is a rich 
          social sculpture, an electronic labyrinth that invites readers to abandon 
          some formal and aesthetic presumptions as they &#8220;enter and move 
          through&#8221; the site. In gesturing toward spatiality and disruption, 
          &#8220;Collision Leaking Species&#8221; provides an exemplary title. 
          Thematics of resistance, interface, habitat and leakage have emerged 
          across all sections of this issue during production. They bear witness 
          to a dazzling and intelligent range of poetic responses to current social, 
          political and cultural weathers.</p>
        <p class="Doublespace">Each word in the phrase &#8220;Collision Leaking Species&#8221; is 
          discrete, yet all three are brought into facing by their arrangement. 
          A sharp kinesis occurs. &#8220;Collision&#8221; and &#8220;species&#8221; 
          seem to be from antithetical points on a plane of events: <em>collision</em> 
          implies the force of accident, while <em>species </em>denotes the controlling 
          order of taxonomies and nomenclatures. They come into encounter through 
          a <em>leaking</em> middle to produce an uncanny synthesis. To &#8220;leak 
          species&#8221; might be to spill beyond standardizing charts into which 
          we have arranged living systems. Or it might suggest new genres and 
          kinds; perhaps those defying name, or un-writing prior &#8220;knowledges&#8221;. 
          To follow species-logic for a moment, the word &#8220;species&#8221; 
          emerges from <em>specere</em>, which also subtends the words &#8220;spectate&#8221; 
          and &#8220;specular&#8221; &#8212; to look or gaze upon in a classificatory 
          and objectifying manner; and also, in a less alienating light, to regard 
          the world with a heightened sense of vigilance and inventive perception 
          (&#8220;speculation&#8221;). Complicated habitats and damaging occupations, 
          such as those shown daily in news media, require the attunements of 
          critical thinking and creative action.</p>
        <p class="Doublespace">Thalia Field&#8217;s <em>zoologic</em> is one of the most interesting 
          and ambitious works in this new edition of <em>How2</em>. Field scrutinizes 
          the ideological architectures of &#8220;the species house&#8221;, with 
          its &#8220;critical distance doled out in centimeters.&#8221; Via the 
          animation of written text accompanied by sound, Field traverses ideational 
          ground that connects place and spatiality (&#8220;she thinks spatially&#8221;); 
          corporeality, gender, technology, capture and territory; ecological 
          imperialism; and notions of home, foreignness and displacement &#8212; 
          all punctuated by satirical insights about Heideggerean concepts of 
          <em>habitas</em> and their philosophical reception. Her use of a &#8220;chorus&#8221; 
          creates a skew in histories of dramaturgy. Field&#8217;s electronic 
          text is made to reckon with its own means of technological reproduction: 
          &#8220;out of character&#8221;, &#8220;out of print&#8221; and devising 
          &#8220;multiple degrees of freedom&#8221;, even as it berates &#8220;the 
          overcooked human packaging of the C21st.&#8221; This work defies specification 
          in a highly informed way. Featured also in <strong>Multi-media</strong>, 
          Susan Johanknecht, Hazel Smith, Melissa Benham and Stacey Dacheux give 
          us works that problematize the borders of informational, bodily and 
          social discourses, while sharing Field&#8217;s welcome engagement with 
          a poetics of containment and space.</p>
        <p class="Doublespace">These matters also inflect Frances Presley&#8217;s selection of new 
          poetry in &#8220;<strong>The Text as a Site of Resistance</strong>.&#8221; 
          Tilla Brading and Geraldine Monk provide <em>the stitch</em> and <em>the 
          fabric</em> with openly political shades of meaning, in relation to 
          gendered art-making and governmental spin; while Christine Kennedy&#8217;s 
          &#8220;Dusting the Mae West Memorial Library&#8221; explores links between 
          sexuality, historical celebrity, image and economy. Sites of embodied 
          resistance and memory inhabit a wide horizon of everyday circumstance 
          and experience &#8212; as suggested by Andrea Baker&#8217;s visual poem 
          &#8220;House&#8221;, in which transfigurations of bodies and dwellings 
          occur in response to located grief. Hilda Bronstein&#8217;s selection 
          of papers from the London TALKS series offers a range of perspectives 
          on embodiment, genre and location (<strong>In-Conference</strong>), 
          while mapping a site-specific event of critical community.</p>
        <p class="Doublespace">Three <strong>Special Features</strong> in this issue celebrate three 
          very different exponents of poetic narrative, its habitats and (dis)contents. 
          Our much-anticipated critical focus on innovative writer <strong>Leslie 
          Scalapino</strong> presents the full text of Scalapino&#8217;s &#8216;<em>Can&#8217;t&#8217; 
          Is &#8216;Night</em>&#8217; &#8212; a demanding and astute response 
          to U.S. military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to the occupations 
          of language that establish and annihilate the bounds of meaning for 
          that conflict. Made by writer Rob Holloway in London, a recording of 
          Scalapino reading the work is available for listening. Scalapino&#8217;s 
          phenomenological &#8220;poetic of occurrence structures&#8221; is investigated 
          in critical pieces by section coordinator Laura Hinton, Elisabeth Frost, 
          Jeanne Heuving, Alicia Cohen and Camille Martin; while Zack, who has 
          collaborated with Scalapino to produce several of her performance texts 
          live, writes about the difficulties and pleasures of staging her writings. 
          In a lengthy interview with Anne Brewster, Scalapino describes her poetic 
          in terms of a kinesis of being &#8212; such that a person becomes somehow 
          inseparable from their surroundings, while consciously detaching from 
          the ideational coercions of mass media: &#8220;I&#8217;m interested 
          in seeing oneself as a motion, or one&#8217;s interior ideas, thoughts, 
          almost as small minute movements that are placed against a sense of 
          the socially constructed, to create separation as a transformation of 
          one&#8217;s own mind.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="Doublespace">&#8220;Seeing oneself as a motion&#8221; could apply equally to the 
          enduring narrative gifts offered to readers by modernist doyenne Gertrude 
          Stein. I am very excited in this issue to present &#8220;<strong>A Narrative 
          in Escaped Places</strong>&#8221;, a series of contemporary responses 
          to Steinian texts and techniques. In their sheer diversity, these pieces 
          &#8212; by Janet Neigh, Carla Harryman, Mary Ann Caws, Michael Farrell, 
          Mark Byron, Marina Morbiducci and Rob Holloway &#8212; remind us that 
          Stein&#8217;s formidable legacy is still unfolding, generations after 
          her death; and that her oeuvre permits great elasticity of interpretation 
          and rejoinder. We are honoured to include Mary Ann Caws&#8217; tribute 
          to feminist scholar Carolyn Heilbrun, a Steinian tracing of a very particular 
          and circumambulatory friendship between two women. Legacy and interpretation 
          are in the thematic foreground of Sawako Nagayasu&#8217;s compelling 
          feature on <strong>Japanese modernist innovation</strong>, in which 
          Sawako&#8217;s crisply balanced translations of Sagawa Chika appear 
          alongside translations of Ema Sh&ocirc;ko by Miryam Sas. A fascinating 
          essay by leading Japanese critic Arai Toyomi is translated by Janine 
          Beichman, and provides a valuable account of the socio-cultural context 
          of modernist experiment by Japanese women poets.</p>
        <p class="Doublespace"><em>How2</em> is a biannual journal &#8212; and the riches of this 
          issue may take readers at least six months to unwrap and explore. As 
          usual, <strong>Alerts</strong> features an excellent range of reviews 
          and discussions; while <strong>Postcards</strong> has gained a new coordinating 
          editor, Romney Steele, and promises to be revitalized in months ahead. 
          Please check the <strong>Masthead</strong> and <strong>Updates</strong> 
          pages for details of section coordinators, forthcoming features and 
          writing events.</p>
        <p class="Doublespace">I will finish by drawing attention to some questions facing <em>How2</em>. 
          Electronic journals are a curious (and leaky) species of texts, whose 
          parameters shift constantly. As a biannual production, <em>How2</em> 
          still employs a largely print-based aesthetic when organizing its material. 
          Several of the sections update regularly, but this accounts for a small 
          part of the journal&#8217;s content. How might <em>How2</em> explore 
          the capacities of new media &#8212; and where to now, for web-based 
          art forms? What kinds of communities are produced by electronic technologies, 
          and do web-oriented forms suggest particular issues of participation 
          and access? Are these topics gendered, linguistic, generational, cultural, 
          spatial? Is there room for <em>How2</em> to become more immediately 
          responsive to the desires and interests of its readers, in relation 
          to the quick transmissions of electronic technologies? Over the coming 
          year &#8212; and across the borders of many different localities now 
          involved in this exciting international project &#8212; we hope to explore 
          some of these questions.</p>
        <p class="Doublespace">My huge thanks to managing editor Dell Olsen (London) and webdesigner 
          Roberta Sims (Lewisburg, PA), who have worked tirelessly to bring this 
          edition to light; to all section coordinators for your illuminating 
          discoveries and patient toil; and to all our contributors and readers, 
          without whom there would be no journal. Enjoy the issue.</p>
