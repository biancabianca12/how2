      <P CLASS="TITLE2">Kylie Minogue and the 
        Ignorance of the West</span></P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The pop singer Kylie Minogue was born in Melbourne 
        in 1968 and started acting quite young (age 7 or 8) on such Australian-filmed 
        TV series as <i>The Henderson Kids </i>and <i>Young Talent Time!  </i>As 
        a teenager her role as Charlene, the tomboy auto mechanic on the Australian 
        soap <i>Neighbours, </i>brought her to national attention.  “Charlene” 
        was feisty, awkward, sweet; when she fell in love with “Scott,” the boy 
        next door, Kylie Minogue made the cover of TIME Australia arm in arm with 
        Jason Donovan, the fresh-faced blond who played “Scott.”  In one episode 
        Scott’s “footy” team won a spirited match and Charlene grew so exhilarated 
        at the party afterwards that she jumped onto the bar of the local and 
        belted out the old Carole King 60s dance song, “The Lo-comotion.”  Somehow 
        this episode caught the eye of Stock/Aitken/Waterman (S/A/W), then London’s 
        pre-eminent pop writers and producers in the old Phil Spector mold.  They 
        brought Minogue to the UK and put her to work in their hit factory, recording 
        dozens of unbearably catchy imitations of Madonna’s great hits of the 
        mid 1980s.  The S/A/W brand name, attached to their giant publicity machine, 
        made Kylie Minogue a recording star, and her first 15 singles all reached 
        #1 on the UK charts.  It’s the same old story you’ve heard a gazillion 
        times before.  Pete Waterman also imported “Scott” (Jason Donovan), Kylie’s 
        offscreen boyfriend as well, as made him sing too, with pointedly less 
        success.  The two of them have a majestically awful duet, “Especially 
        for You,” which makes the Diana Ross–Lionel Richie “Endless Love” sound 
        like Mahler in comparison.  Most of these early hits are pretty crumby, 
        but the best of them are pleasurable reminders of the permeability of 
        image and the magnificent instability of the sign.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Every now and then I log on to perhaps the best of 
        hundreds of Kylie websites, “Limbo,” to follow excited threads such as, 
        “Who’s More Enigmatic—Kylie or Jackie Onassis?” “What Kylie Has taught 
        Me,” “Kylie’s Speaking Voice,” “How Tall is Kylie—really?”  And yet to 
        date I have only met maybe 50 Americans who know who she is, all of them 
        gay men of a certain age and a certain artistic temperament, and only 
        two people—the French photographic duo Pierre et Gilles—who have actually 
        met and worked with her.  It’s almost as if she doesn’t exist in America, 
        and yet she’s at the center of my universe.  Well, that is the feeling, 
        the <i>feeling of insecurity.  When we’re not together, tell me everything’s 
        gonna be all right</i>…<i></i></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Wolfgang Tillmans’ photo of Kylie shows her sweating 
        in some loud club, a bottle of Carlsberg Lager propped in front of her, 
        she’s made up minimally, her hair pinned back behind her ears, she’s all 
        propped up listening wide-eyed to some unseen big man with a hairy fist 
        and a giant gold ring who’s gesturing towards her with stern authority.  
        Or perhaps he’s brushing her cheek with great tenderness.  She seems alive—intensely 
        so, but pale, like most of Tillmans’ subjects, who all look so European 
        and bubblelicious.  She’s only 5 feet 1, a toy, in a black T-shirt that’s 
        ridden up both arms.  I’d like Tillmans to take my photo to see how “candid” 
        his subjects really are but they seem like they are all so busy, too busy 
        to notice his lens, oh well we’re all on TV all the time nowadays anyhow, 
        it’s a fact of life like the climate or the white noise that surrounds 
        us.  All the light in the club is directed at her face and hands, which 
        cup her chin, her fingers tapping at her temples.  She doesn’t look like 
        a great brain.  Whose arm is that, with its tattoo, its plastic beaded 
        bracelet, and that gold nugget ring?  Her face anointed with oil, the 
        Turner Prize gleaming just outside the frame of the photo.square.club.  
        The odd thing is that Kylie herself will never win any awards, for nothing.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the book <i>Kylie Evidence, </i>a group of international 
        photographers and conceptual artists play numerous variations on a single 
        iconic image, the girl next door gone bad, the myth of Kylie Minogue.  
        This hideous myth, so dear to my heart, is deployed in often ludicrous 
        contexts.  In the “Home of the Dew Drop Fairy,” Karen Kilimnik replaces 
        Kylie’s image with a big red blowsy rose still life (to show decay), that’s 
        being stalked by a cunning little squirrel tasting the glassy dew (to 
        show her innocence).  Flip the page, there she is riding a carousel horse, 
        in a sexed-up nun outfit, skirts hiked way up her thigh, in Pierre et 
        Gilles’ flashy, nutty hand-colored photo.  Poor Kylie, detached from the 
        artificial S/A/W soundscapes that made her once a beloved mascot for children, 
        here assuming the suffering and fun of all the world.  <i>I’ll forgive, 
        and forget, if you say you love me so, cos it’s true, what they say: better 
        the devil you know.</i></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Kylie was still dating Jason, and still under the 
        thumb of her evil producers, who in turn were determined to keep their 
        cash cow going as long as they could, when she met Michael Hutchence, 
        the lead singer of Australia’s biggest rock band, INXS.  Instantly she 
        changed from the girl next door to tabloid heroine.  Asked what his hobby 
        was, Hutchence is said to have replied, “Corrupting Kylie.”  For he was 
        the bad, Mick Jagger-like Faust to Kylie’s Marguerite.  Everyone loves 
        a good Harlequin romance, and this one was a pip.  All of a sudden it 
        was Jason who?  Under Hutchence’s spell, Kylie turned to drink, drugs, 
        sex, art and bohemianism, and determined also to seize her own image away 
        from her Svengali producers, finally finishing her contract and striking 
        out on her own.  Hutchence abandoned Kylie,—the cad!—for the supermodel 
        Helena Christensen, but our girl never looked back, and made a series 
        of more sophisticated, “indie” pop records through which, bit by bit, 
        she lost her core audience but gained a resolute and intransigent fan 
        base of young gay male admirers.  In search of artistic integrity, she 
        attempted collaborations with a number of pre-eminent 90s rock musicians, 
        including Prince, Lenny Kravitz, Bono, the Pet Shop Boys, Nick Cave, Robbie 
        Williams and dozens more, and signed with a small, alternative dance label 
        called “DeConstruction.”  Doesn’t that name say it all?  Alas, although 
        she rocketed back to #1 on the UK charts with her first DeConstruction 
        single, a slow, anthemic Revolver-esque ballad called “Confide in Me,” 
        subsequent releases failed to do well, and this period culminated in the 
        debacle of her most ambitious LP, <i>Impossible Princess, </i>which had 
        the misfortune of being released on the day Diana (Spencer) died, when 
        British airwaves were ruled by Elton John’s treacly Diana tribute “Candle 
        in the Wind ’98.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Of course Kylie had acting to turn to.  During the 
        PWL days she starred in her first film, <i>The Delinquents, </i>a 50s 
        coming of age story—like <i>Splendor in the Grass</i> and just as dated.  
        International films came next, but starring opposite Jean Claude van Damme 
        in <i>Street Fighter </i>and opposite Pauly Shore in the ridiculous flop 
        <i>Bio-Dome </i>didn’t do much for her.  She appeared onstage in the Bahamas 
        in an experimental production of <i>The Tempest </i>(supposedly the actual 
        setting Shakespeare had in mind!) but who is going to go to the Bahamas 
        to see Kylie Minogue as Miranda?  MAYBE Robert Wilson?  Baz Luhrmann, 
        the stylish Australian director, long a Kylie fan, cast her in his musical 
        film <i>Moulin Rouge, </i>with Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, but its 
        commercial possibilities seem limited, and Kylie’s part lasts only forty-eight 
        seconds (she’s the Green Fairy on the label of an absinthe bottle, who 
        comes to life, flirts briefly with McGregor, and sings an odd snatch from 
        “The Sound of Music”).  Nevertheless sheer will power won out and last 
        year, in June, Kylie scrapped her arty, nihilistic vision and launched 
        a full-scale return to the pop music that made her famous in the first 
        place, with a new single, a new label, a new album and loads of press, 
        and the music world gasped as “Spinning Around” became #1, and succeeding 
        singles have done well too.  She was the featured star at the closing 
        of the Sydney Olympics in October 2000.  People love that, everyone loves 
        a great comeback.  <i>Light Years </i>is a marvelous LP, filled with a 
        kitsch instantly recognizable and resonant of 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s pop 
        music and vibrant back beats, quoting from everything under the sun, unmistakably 
        the work of a second- or third-rate talent more precious than any number 
        of big time geniuses.  This year there’s a new album, <i>Fever, </i>released 
        this month, Kylie purring over a 1982 bassline nicked from old Kraftwerk 
        and Giorgio Moroder productions, and a great chart war overseas between 
        Kylie and the nuttily popular Victoria Beckham, formerly known as Posh 
        Spice, that rivals the war for the Rings of Power.  Still the US knows 
        nothing of Kylie at all.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If you’ve read Irvine Welsh’s story “Where the Debris 
        Meets the Sea” (from his collection <i>The Acid House</i>), you know that 
        Kylie, Kim Basinger, Madonna and Victoria Principal are all sitting around 
        a house in California regaling each other with their private erotic fantasies.  
        Sam Taylor-Wood’s video installation “Misfit” featured Kylie naked, miming 
        the recorded voice of the very last (19th century) castrato.  Do we look 
        to her to find out what’s she up to next, or who can talk her into what?  
        Who talked her into the recent UK TV appearance duetting with Ricky Martin 
        on “Livin’ la Vida Loca?”  She was great, but my goodness, Ricky Martin!</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Kylie is continually compared with her alter ego, 
        Madonna, a decade older and considerably more famous.  Everything Madonna 
        does, Kylie does too.  (Madonna <i>already</i> duetted with Ricky.)  Madonna 
        and Kylie make an almost religious pair, a diptych of Darwinian selection 
        poked through the tight gaze of funk culture.  It’s my fantasy of history, 
        poetry, interspecies warfare—that’s all.  <i>Kylie Evidence</i> is awfully 
        like Madonna’s notorious <i>Sex</i> book of the “Erotica” period, except 
        it’s more varied, well, it has to be doesn’t it?  Madonna is often called 
        the “Queen of Pop,” while Kylie is the “Princess,” perhaps a younger version 
        without the woes and cares Madonna is always foregrounding in her public 
        appearances.  Kylie without genitals, or with the genitals of a little 
        boy, as in Simon Henwood’s Darger imitations—naked but for a necklace, 
        tiny tackle and all, permitted only a kind of genital power and a spectral 
        innocence.  She’s more vulnerable than Madonna, but seems more resilient 
        because she’s from Australia.  Kylie knows the raw power of the flat, 
        comic book image, and the internecine enmity between language and image.  
        <i>Evidence</i> plays beautifully along the thin line that stretches between 
        irony and “true feeling,” how one is often the obverse of the other, the 
        Mobius strip inside modernism’s motor apparatus.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In Berkeley this spring, after a poetry reading, 
        Ed Gilbert and I were speaking of Kylie in muted voices, and then John 
        Ashbery, whose reading we had just attended, spoke up behind our backs.  
        “Excuse me, but did I hear you talking about Kylie Minogue?”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Yeah!” I said, bowing to the polymath Ashbery.  
        “How much do you love her?”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">He looked bemused but allowed that he had seen Kylie’s 
        appearance, playing herself, in the UK sitcom <i>The Vicar of Dibley.  
        </i>I haven’t seen this one myself but apparently the Vicar has rashly 
        promised to get Elton John to open the village fete, and the day seems 
        lost until Kylie is produced as some kind of acceptable substitute.  I 
        hand it to John Ashbery as always—I have to, I wouldn’t be human otherwise.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Her name—<i>Kylie Minogue</i>—is an alphabet from 
        which all meaning has been scooped out, denoting a powerful sovereignty.  
        Re-arrange the letters to spell “I like ’em young.”  More often than not, 
        the icon is in peril, at the mercy of words.  Huge, dysfunctional words 
        knock her over on her side.  We her fans are evenly split, some of us 
        preferring the “indie Kylie” of “Confide in Me” and <i>Impossible Princess, 
        </i>some of us rejoicing that she has returned to her pop roots with <i>Light 
        Years.  </i>In Australia she has become an advertising emblem for “Pepsi 
        Cola”—very Stuart Davis, clean, cool and marvellously articulated.  Words 
        will always spell peril for our heroine, once dubbed the “Singing Budgie.”  
        Overdrawn characters hover and rumble, portents seen in an angry dream, 
        suspended in an ominous foreground of pure space.  In 1998 the Japanese 
        DJ Towa Tei released a stuttering, techno-house composition called “G.B.I.” 
        that features Kylie’s vocals as disembodied chirps.  “Hello/  My name 
        is German Bold Italic/  I am a typeface/ Which you have never heard before/  
        Which you have never seen before/  I can compliment you well/  Especially 
        in red/  Extremely in green/  Maybe in blue blue blue.”  She penetrates 
        into the heartless, cutting blitheness of the word.  “You will like my 
        sense of style/  I fit like a glove—ooh!/  Gut ja!/  Gut ja!”   Cumbersome 
        as office machines on wheels, words—headlines, gossip, innuendo, the language 
        of “hasbeenism”—form layers of occluded meaning, their signs sublimated 
        to the function of marketing tools as they peek around her tiny head in 
        luscious bouquets of sick color.  Black and white look best on her, but 
        Minogue is a canny colorist and her use of grays, reds and blues is never 
        wrong.  Because she is so plastic, she looks different in every video, 
        every photograph, it took me several months to be able to identify her 
        from day to day.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But what does one do with one’s enthusiasms?  Where 
        do they keep?  There’s an anxiety in declaring oneself a Kylie fan—similar 
        to how coming out used to feel.  (Nowadays it’s the same exact thing I 
        suppose.)  Dennis Cooper can say, “Oh, I’m influenced by Bresson,” and 
        people will nod with approbation, even if they’re thinking of <i>Cartier-</i>Bresson.  
        I suffered some credibility loss while under the spell of Dario Argento, 
        but nothing like the waves of shame and misery that engulf me when people 
        say, “Kylie who?  That girl who did ‘The Lo-comotion’?”  I think I like 
        her because she reminds me of myself, I don’t have Dennis’ genius, not 
        to mention Bresson’s, but like Kylie I can stretch out a second or third 
        rate talent and make it mean something by a) insisting on its smallness; 
        b) attempting to push the envelope, usually by collaboration with others 
        and c) feeling no guilt when, in a corner, at the end of my tether, or 
        upset by something in my personal life, I retreat to my roots and produce 
        version XYZ of the thing I know you’ll like from me.  Do you think Kylie’s 
        work is all about <i>post Colonialism?  </i>That “Tempest” production 
        sure was.  “Kylie” is said to be the Maori word for “boomerang.”  This 
        is often noted approvingly, as a boomerang “comes back” as often as Kylie 
        has, but is it at all plausible?  Queens appreciate the pathos of the 
        Kylie legend, its cheesiness itself enormously appealing, the way Kylie 
        survived a precocious stardom as “Charlene” to have sex with Michael Hutchence, 
        who’s not all that well known <i>himself, </i>and then to not even be 
        the girl he hung himself because of.  There’s no Dennis Rodman in Kylie’s 
        back room; of course there were Prince and Lenny Kravitz.  I flip through 
        picture after picture, poke them out across the rug: an obsessive rendering, 
        a trip-hop world of displacement and deracination good to go.  Kylie Minogue 
        isn’t the first artist to find beauty in Freud’s “uncanny,” nor the first 
        to locate the <i>unheimlich </i>squarely in the detritus of today’s commercial 
        culture.  A purposive, kitschy flatness of gaze underlines her determination, 
        the steadiness of her eye.  What emerges is touching, almost saintly.  
        Her critics say her voice sounds as though she’s reading all her words 
        off a prompter, that she lacks heart.  Often she sounds as though English 
        were not her own language.  Kylie fans re-settle the unsettling haunt 
        of sexuality by our insistence on customization—adapting, subverting its 
        broad strokes to our own homey use.  It’s this impulse—gears shifting 
        downward from public to private—that Kylie understands and illuminates 
        beautifully.  She extends this generosity to her own art, which seems 
        unfinished, left to complete by the viewer.  Thus there’s an empty, spooky 
        sigh at the heart of this work.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Iconic objects take on eerie lives of their own and 
        no one knows their business, not even the moguls at Skywalker Ranch who 
        control everything else.  I can spot a fellow fan of Kylie’s halfway around 
        the room.  We share a “secret understanding” akin to E M Forster’s concept 
        of homosexuality as a willed gift.  Cold hard tears seep from this work, 
        tears shed for an implacable universe of wanting and wishing and denial.</p>
