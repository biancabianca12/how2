	  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">  This piece was read at The Kootenay School in Vancouver 
        and Subtext in Seattle, in Fall 2002. A few excerpts from this piece were

      <hr>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2">St. Augustine</P>
      <p>St. Augustine,</p>
      <p>You have become a question to myself.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><i>Appetitus</i></p>
      <p>St. Augustine,<br>
        Love means that I want you to organize my guilt.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Do you recognize your own unique cupidity,<br>
        Your over-souled package,<br>
        That central radiating genitalia,<br>
        That generates mutiny in my vehicle.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Frolic<br>
        St. Augustine.<br>
        Your dream clock is my hysteria,<br>
        My hideous creation.</p>
      <p>I consider a certain point on the screen.<br>
        I cover up one slit.  I find the nonzero.</p>
      <p>Habit descends unexpectedly<br>
        in my florid sleep,</p>
      <p>in ripe<br>
        folding<br>
        civility.<br>
        It stills<br>
        The silkiness<br>
        I cradle in<br>
        the remembering<br>
        of<br>
        gender.<br>
        I shred<br>
        the pink<br>
        borderless<br>
        tongue.<br>
        I breathe the stain.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, if you speak the words father or kitchen<br>
        you will split the sides of your mouth.</p>
      <p>Instead, I will kiss the sides of your mouth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine,</p>
      <p>the mind is a fly.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><i>Cupiditas<br>
        </i>St. Augustine,<br>
        to recognize the circles of blue-white trees<br>
        you allow both my possible paths.<br>
        The answer to my yes is a no in both cases.<br>
        This place will not happen with absolute precision.<br>
        Your second is not my second.</p>
      <p>The garage owner is your theory and requires my suspicion.</p>
      <p>St. Augustine,<br>
        innocence can be thought  as an artifact in the furtive curvature of space.<br>
        As if to mitigate the machine.<br>
        As if desire includes light.<br>
        As if the function of the citizen were true.<br>
        A wet grasp<br>
        due to the pernicious<br>
        velocity of our bodies.</p>
      <p>Take a window for example or you won’t see anything familiar.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Affix seven to the plain face of Jesus<br>
        slip up his wedding neck and<br>
        draw back.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine,</p>
      <p>words stench<br>
        and shrink.</p>
      <p>Because<br>
        mentions proximity and my grammar follows<br>
        in a yellow pasture<br>
        where our deficiency was its dream.</p>
      <p>A far<br>
        short blue<br>
        where<br>
        I was<br>
        the egg<br>
        in<br>
        the lit trees.<br>
        Your fiction was a deliberate mineral,<br>
        a noisy boil<br>
        of indecision—<br>
        swarming<br>
        lines of stain.<br>
        Across the wood last night<br>
        I almost asked you<br>
        is chaos a person<br>
        waiting to see?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Raking the mind from its body,<br>
        I tilted your hands and then your shoulders,<br>
        as if you were a cup:<br>
        the mouth of my encounter.</p>
      <p>St Augustine, the mind is an ache.<br>
        Your sound is the twin of desire.</p>
      <p>Thus<br>
        such<br>
        blue.</p>
      <p>I can’t feel<br>
        the horizon line.<br>
        The skin seen in<br>
        a calm vertical  blue<br>
        is noisier than reality.<br>
        My light pitches itself in percussion,<br>
        in a rash golden bind.<br>
        My mind wavers<br>
        in your egret, in your unit of diction.</p>
      <p>My leaves dampen<br>
        in the swell of your utterance as if Homer were erotic,<br>
        a line<br>
        in a din of love that I can’t reach from here.<br>
        Like your forehead and<br>
        its thankful nakedness,<br>
        its oval and its<br>
        kissing.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Will a boy not recognize the odours of algae and rain?<br>
        Will my fine experience always terrorize me?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine,<br>
        During my illness you said my name in translation:<br>
        a gaping wound that was mistaken for the body,<br>
        fastening its contagion to the ambiguity of my regret—<br>
        when I know you, I regret.<br>
        My addiction coincides with your absurdity.<br>
        I love you is in every case a fastening to brute choice.<br>
        Desire has mistaken my body<br>
        for silence in the dizzying sum of its breath.<br>
        A rare violence is more beautiful than its nudity.<br>
        No obscurity forest,<br>
        but I loved you to love love.<br>
        You were the appliance of my husband’s wage.<br>
        I dreamed the inhabitant in his desert.<br>
        I dreamed that a body will cross another,<br>
        But a sister will repeat mechanically and betray the mind<br>
        and drown like a poet in the suffering<br>
        excursion of denial.<br>
        And you, you will die on the beach in the tracks of important tigers.<br>
        You will be wearing a hat and socialism will not dazzle your fantastic 
        phraseology.<br>
        The military will always fashion itself in men<br>
        and the state weakens like a body swallowed in water.</p>
      <p>It is the odour of our landscape</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, were you crazy?</p>
      <p>Your thighs opened for my mouth.<br>
        Your lips opened for my fingers.<br>
        Your tongue sought my teeth.<br>
        Your skin was my skin.<br>
        Your hair was my hair.</p>
      <p>Sleep,<br>
        go home—this is the way madmen protect your life—<br>
        shot with black; hands lit with fire.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><i>Dilectio</i></p>
      <p>St. Augustine, you did not claim the emperors were happy.<br>
        But for Cicero,<br>
        there were no limits to the claims of our country.<br>
        Dampening the political pagan,<br>
        you sold the city, the citizen.<br>
        No idea<br>
        now can be rid of this stench.<br>
        Before anything we are small, single and stinking.<br>
        We reverberate with this pallor of infinity.<br>
        Our genitals are steel,<br>
        not water, not bathing, nor pleasure—the state is born from us.</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, you exist by virtue of my exile.<br>
        You did not exist before me; now you exist without me.</p>
      <p>The animals are famous as you are for your hair, your swinging hair, 
        your set teeth, your soft white legs.</p>
      <p>In those days we were absentmindedly Parisienne.  We were not ashamed.  
        We were not suicidal.  We were nobody else in the world.  We ate white; 
        we wore white. We were public and proud of victory, the unblemished reputation 
        and the indecent haste of our executions.</p>
      <p>But, was it prudent to commit the empire to our swift movements, to our 
        pernicious velocity, our little numbers?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><i>Caritas</i></p>
      <p>I remind you to reconcile.  For example, I cannot directly measure my 
        grandmother.  Her simple manifestation is not simple.  For example, I 
        am no longer ashamed of this desire.  I allow both possible paths.</p>
      <p>St. Augustine love the memory of love.<br>
        We lead between time and space.  If we close one slit, we change the rules.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, I miss you.<br>
        I miss your fine skin.<br>
        My mouth tries your name<br>
        I have not spoken in so long.</p>
      <p>Simplicity is only inches above the water</p>
      <p>St. Augustine.</p>
      <p>You are smooth, but stone—</p>
      <p>except the knuckles,</p>
      <p>and their sickening joy.</p>
      <p>You did not survive either</p>
      <p>and now nothing needs the anticipatory glance of the concrete dream.</p>
      <p>An ensemble of forms does not stretch deep below the stone well.</p>
      <p>Sunlight is only a veil on this shaded ground.</p>
      <p>The sign praise is complete.</p>
      <p>And yet, once as a child I became suddenly ill and was at the point of 
        death and you came and<br>
        you wore my garden and you said that<br>
        devotion was not mathematically sick.<br>
        But in recent years your rules no longer describe an imaginary nature.<br>
        Your left is not longer my right.<br>
        My thigh is no longer the hallucination of one who is watching.</p>
      <p>Within these pinning violations I cover one slit and I find that there 
        is a nonzero probability. </p>
      <p>This is exactly what can happen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, you loved<br>
        your simple inventions<br>
        my holy crimes</p>
      <p>No longer weeping, I enter your chamber, I take your robes, I cover your 
        body with my hands.   I no longer care;  I care too long.  I no longer 
        wait.  My crime is moving towards you.</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, you cannot fuck my image, your fluster, you tendency will 
        get in the way.</p>
      <p>You cannot have my triangular measure for your universal.  It lives more 
        than one thousand kilometers from your indigenous pupils.</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, your mathematics are frozen.</p>
      <p>But, my civilizational other never flocked, never labelled the internal 
        coherent.</p>
      <p>And yet, still, we sucked the pomegranate, licked the stray dogs<br>
        and realized with chagrin the playing measure of our bloody quiet.</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, I hate you.</p>
      <p>Quicken this winter, my chair is riveted to your terms.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>My phobic truth was your discipline.<br>
        My lush obscurity, your citizen lips.<br>
        I prod this fetish twig<br>
        for my fantasy is velocity and I cannot resist the liquid of its pronunciations, 
      </p>
      <p>its oval site,<br>
        its mirror—<br>
        not near<br>
        not sky,  or star  or pear</p>
      <p>I remind you to reconsider.<br>
        St. Augustine,<br>
        your body is home,<br>
        your mind is peril.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And the unconditioned claim of our allegiance?</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, we sold the voluptuous empire,<br>
        the graceful republic,<br>
        the beautiful tax collectors.</p>
      <p>We gave them their graceful things, their prudent authority—<br>
        Modest God and oracle Christ were a fee.</p>
      <p>The happy city, the<br>
        loving civic.<br>
        St. Augustine,<br>
        you were the extrusion of my ethic.</p>
      <p>But, the impunity of the kingdom, you said—<br>
        the obligation of the empire,<br>
        the private members hammered to wholeness,<br>
        not chariot.</p>
      <p>Your fictions are my perjury</p>
      <p>You swore you could not eat flesh;  that you love none other.<br>
        But, St. Augustine, the ordered subject, the moment of nation<br>
        is kissing and massacre fishes for the fashion of the  Godly.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Oh, biddable citizen desire my lacking step.  </p>
      <p>My apex is your deep ineradicable west.</p>
      <p>Drink history and cool my inhabitant.  </p>
      <p>Love my erasure, love my history—<br>
        it glorifies you.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><i>amore<br>
        </i><i>dilecto<br>
        </i><i>caritas<br>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine I am torrent to your greed.</p>
      <p>We lost the republic long ago.<br>
        You bade our vice, our fading age</p>
      <p>And look at the republic now, the most beautiful.</p>
      <p>Once there was a room for us and we touched our beads of skin.<br>
        It could not last—it did not last.<br>
        The state was not with us.<br>
        We ignored its dictum, its edict.</p>
      <p>We did not care for its rulings and then we did.<br>
        Our impossibility was my mistake, my desire</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, I am not free of your taste.  The Republic does not thank 
        me.</p>
      <p>I did not kill your corrupt authority—I gave it life.</p>
      <p>I am the diversion of your hybridity</p>
      <p>(What man would not compare this republic?)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine, the narrative is a former puncture,<br>
        a bruise strewn to its writing.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine.   I desire goods.   I gain possession of what I most own.   
        I crave the bronze and welded citizen.   I deplore my molten state.  I 
        peal the simplicity, and the signal.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>St. Augustine,<br>
        I have eaten my hands.<br>
        St. Augustine<br>
        I have eaten your eyes.</p>
