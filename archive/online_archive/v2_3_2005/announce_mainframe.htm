[See appropriate section for next issue's guest editor/her e-mail address.]</p>      <p>You will be contacted within one month of sending your proposal, regarding its viability for the issue in progress.</p>      <hr>      <p class="announceHeading">HOW TO SUBMIT WRITING TO HOW2</p>      <p>Sending Submissions by Email: Essays, &quot;readings,&quot; scholarly studies or pieces of &quot;new writing&quot; (poetry or mixed genre forms) should be submitted directly to the editor of that particular section. Make sure you identify -- in the subject or the message -- which section of HOW2 the writing is being directed at (e.g.: new writing, readings, conferences, forums, etc.).</p>      <p><strong>Text:</strong> is best sent as RTF (Rich Text Format) or a Microsoft Word document (Microsoft Word 98 or 2000) as an attachment to an e-mail (not within the e-mail). Most word processors can save a file as RTF text.</p>      <p><strong>File Title:</strong> Please write the title of each file so that your surname starts the filename, eg. Faganpoem1.doc. Remember also to attach the appropriate suffix (eg. &quot;.rtf&quot; or &quot;.doc&quot;) to the filenames if you are using a Mac.</p>      <p><strong>Font:</strong> The standard font for all texts in How2 is Georgia or Times New Roman.</p>      <p><strong>Layout:</strong> In most cases, we produces poems in single space, and prose pieces in double space. If your piece requires a different sort of line spacing, please indicate this and we will try to accommodate you.</p>      <p>Please use tabs rather than the spacebar when formatting poems. Arrangements using the spacebar are lost when converted to HTML.</p>      <p><strong>Graphics:</strong> These are best sent as e-mail attachments in the forms of JPEGs. Please add the suffix &quot;.jpg&quot; (not &quot;.jpeg&quot;) in lower case to the file name. If you are scanning the artwork yourself, please scan it at 100% size, with the resolution set to 300, 150 or 72 DPI.</p>      <p>All manuscripts should include a short bio/biblio note with recent information and publications. In addition, a Working Note must accompany all &quot;new writing&quot; contributions. (See current new writing section for examples).</p>      <hr>      <p class="announceHeading">GUIDELINES</p>      <p>Proposals for original artwork should bear in mind the requirements of this journal. A xerox or photograph of suggested graphics should be sent to the editors, rather than original art work. If a piece of work is requested by an editor for a particular issue, the artist will then be asked to send the original art work to a designated postal address.</p>      <hr>      <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p align="center">      <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">        <param name="movie" value="media/navbar.swf">        <param name="quality" value="high">        <embed src="media/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>      </object>    </p></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
