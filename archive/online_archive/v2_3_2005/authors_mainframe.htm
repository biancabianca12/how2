For poetry to exist, it has to be given meaning, and for meaning to develop there must be communities of people thinking about it. Publishing books as I did was a way of contributing to such a community&mdash;even a way of helping to invent it.

How might an editorial poetics of publishing that includes (or exists exclusively as) gift economy alter, challenge and create economic and aesthetic resistance or subversion? Independent publishers, specifically those committed to avant-garde writing and its strategies, engage modes of representation that often are under specific pressures. What happens when presses commit to publishing chapbooks, either exclusively or in part? Where do chapbooks fall within this rubric of small press publishing, particularly as few bookstores or distributors are willing to carry them?</p>      <p align="justify">Many independent publishers are committed to an editorial practice that challenges competition and the contest system now common to many university and not-for-profit presses, especially in the United States. In what ways might contest-driven / competition models blunt critical inquiry or limit the possibilities of poetry itself? Communities tend to coalesce for a variety of reasons; how might we describe the communities that editors, publishers, distributors, poets and readers of independent presses are in the process of participating in &amp;/or inventing? </p>      <p align="justify"><strong>We invite How2 readers to write a brief response to these questions as well as others this forum might raise.

Issues to consider might include gender, site-specific writing, visual arts, film, subjectivities, live art, performing objects, Poets Theater, politics, the body and eroticism.

We are particularly interested in critical articles that might consider visual poetics in relation to the book, technologies of the book, the book as a conceptual object, the book and digital writing, books and site-specific work, books and performance, discussions of collaborations between artists and poets, and reviews and readings of books which challenge the form of the book alongside a questioning of conventional language structures through a range of <br>        writing and making practices. We are especially interested in articles which focus on traditions and histories of the book in relation to Modernist and contemporary practice by women artists and writers.</p>      <p align="justify">Please see our formatting guidelines and send completed submissions (max. 3000 words) to Dell Olsen <a href="mailto:redellolsen@btinternet.com">redellolsen@btinternet.com</a> by December 7th 2005.</p>      <hr>      <p align="left"><B>Volume 2 Issue 3 Associate Editors:</B></P>      <P align="left"><em><strong>Critical feature on Nicole Brossard:</strong></em><br>  Jodi Lundgren (CAN): <a href="mailto:Jlundgren@tru.ca">Jlundgren@tru.ca</a><br>  Kelly-Anne Maddox (CAN): <a href="mailto:Kmaddox@cariboo.bc.ca">Kmaddox@cariboo.bc.ca</a> </P>      <P align="left"><em><strong>Contemporary Japanese Poetry in Translation:</strong></em><br>  Sawako Nakayasu (Japan): <a href="mailto:sawako@factorial.org">sawako@factorial.org</a></P>      <p align="left"><strong><em>New Media:</em></strong><br>  Redell Olsen (UK): <a href="mailto:redellolsen@btinternet.com">redellolsen@btinternet.com</a></p>      <p align="left"><em><strong>New Writing &mdash; Modern Singapore Poetry:</strong></em><br>  Grace Chia (Singapore-UK): <a href="mailto:gracechia@gmail.com">gracechia@gmail.com</a></p>      <p align="left"><strong><em>New Writing &mdash; 14 Poets:</em></strong><br>  Kate Fagan (AUS): <a href="mailto:kfag6311@mail.usyd.edu.au">kfag6311@mail.usyd.edu.au</a><br>  Redell Olsen (UK): <a href="mailto:redellolsen@btinternet.com">redellolsen@btinternet.com</a></p>      <p align="left"><em><strong>Special feature on Alice Duer Miller:</strong></em><br>  Catherine Daly (US): <a href="mailto:cadaly@pacbell.net">cadaly@pacbell.net</a></p>      <hr>      <p align="left"><em><strong>Submissions:</strong></em></p>      <p align="justify">Please send submissions or proposals for feature sections to <strong>Kate Fagan</strong> (editor) or <strong>Dell Olsen</strong> (managing editor).
