Treatment sessions involve two simultaneous procedures: one, the patient conjures up a vivid picture of his painful experience and recounts it while, two, he focuses his eyes on a therapist&rsquo;s fingers as she moves them steadily back and forth across his field of vision.&nbsp; Why this procedure works largely remains a mystery, but somehow the dual focus&mdash;the gaze of the eyes held steadily when combined with the conjured image of the traumatic event in the imagination&mdash;helps to heal the patient&rsquo;s physical and emotional posttraumatic suffering (Shapiro 199-223).</p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">A puzzling relationship between vision, trauma and healing is embedded in the Orphic myth as well.&nbsp; Orpheus, traumatized by the loss of his beloved, seeks her even to the gates of Hades.&nbsp; Because his poems are so beautiful, he is able to charm his way into Hell&mdash;breaking the rules of earth and underworld, life and death.&nbsp; Ultimately, Orpheus is allowed to bring Eurydice out of the Netherworld but on the single condition that he not <i>look</i> at her.&nbsp; Tragically, he cannot resist looking back at his beloved and so loses her again, forever.</p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">It is as an orphic poet that Jack Spicer figured himself from his earliest poems, and it is the project of this essay to explore the relationship of &ldquo;looking back&rdquo; to sorrow, trauma and healing in Spicer&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Spicer&rsquo;s orphic anxiety about looking back, I argue, is strangely linked to the &ldquo;vacancy&rdquo; that he so problematically and relentlessly seeks as an author.&nbsp; An orphic poet, as the Orph&eacute;e character in Jean Cocteau&rsquo;s film says, is a vacant subject&mdash;&ldquo;a writer who doesn&rsquo;t write.&rdquo; Cocteau&rsquo;s film seems to have been central to Spicer&rsquo;s imagination of the orphic, and is indeed the origin of Spicer&rsquo;s famous poet-as-radio metaphor.&nbsp; Spicer seeks to be a &ldquo;writer who doesn&rsquo;t write&rdquo; and so cultivates a relationship to the self which seeks&mdash;at least temporarily&mdash;to make the self disappear just as Eurydice disappears when Orpheus looks upon her.&nbsp; </p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">For Spicer, the most difficult work for a poet is not inventing poems but, rather, the labor involved in getting the poet&rsquo;s own self or ego out of the way so that poems can be effectively channeled from an outside force.&nbsp; In Spicer&rsquo;s words the poet is, at his best, &ldquo;a team player&rdquo; who should seek only to create the <i>ground</i> for the transmission of poem-messages from Others: be they &ldquo;Martians,&rdquo; or &ldquo;God,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ghosts.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this essay I will explore how the orphic vacancy of the poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;self,&rdquo; so much at the heart of Spicer&rsquo;s poetic project, can be read in terms of his refusal to &ldquo;look back&rdquo; specifically at his own past&mdash;to the Los Angeles of his childhood.&nbsp; Spicer&rsquo;s Los Angeles is a kind of hell, an urban aberration that, he claimed, should not even be considered part of the beautiful California region (Gizzi 243). &nbsp;It is not just his own childhood past in Los Angeles which Spicer refused to talk or write about; even as a child, the very thought of LA&rsquo;s recent history was deeply frightening to him.&nbsp; </p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Spicer is typically associated with the Bay Area where he lived most of his adult life.&nbsp; The title of his biography, <i>Jack Spicer and the Berkeley Renaissance,</i> points to this: figuring him as an important player in the art community and locating him geographically in Northern California.&nbsp; Rarely has Spicer been considered in terms of Los Angeles, where he was born and lived until he was twenty years old.&nbsp; Spicer&rsquo;s biographers Kevin Killian and Lew Ellingham don&rsquo;t spend more than a couple pages talking about Spicer&rsquo;s Southern California in their four-hundred page biography.&nbsp; What they do write is that as a child Spicer &ldquo;wondered about his home [&hellip;]&mdash;a hundred years ago, what had these spaces been?&nbsp; Empty forest, native peoples.&nbsp; It frightened him to think of it, so he tried not to.&nbsp; But sometimes he forced himself to think about it, and that scared him even more&rdquo; (7).&nbsp; Why should the wide-open spaces that were home to native peoples less than a hundred years earlier, frighten the young Spicer rather than, say, fascinate him? And might these early orphic anxieties about Los Angeles&rsquo; past have a role in his mature poetics? Indeed it was as a young boy exploring Los Angeles that Spicer decided to become a poet.&nbsp; His biographers sketch him as a &ldquo;bookish boy&rdquo; who loved to investigate:</p>        <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0">      <tr>        <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td>        <td width="80%"><p align="justify" class="at150spaceStandardText">[He] mastered the Dewey Decimal System while still quite young, and in time became an excellent researcher.&nbsp; He had an innate talent for finding things out.&nbsp; &lsquo;He knew how to use the library in a way that no one I ever met did,&rsquo; said a later friend.&nbsp; Jack studied railroad and bus timetables and could really work Los Angeles public transit, [going] on day excursions to the farthest parts of the huge city and its sprawling environs.

Mike Davis writes in his essay &ldquo;How Eden Lost Its Garden&rdquo; that &ldquo;the first smog attack in 1943&mdash;an &lsquo;eerie darkness at noon&rsquo; over the Los Angeles Basin&mdash;caused almost as much consternation as Pearl Harbor&rdquo; (Davis 166).&nbsp; In the same year the State Board of Health declared a &ldquo;gross public health hazard&rdquo; and closed ten miles of fetid beaches to forestall lethal threats of full fledged typhoid and poliomyelitis epidemics&rdquo; (Davis 166).&nbsp; When the famous Olmsted urban development firm was invited in 1930 to study LA&rsquo;s already alarming urban sprawl, they recommended a network of urban green spaces that would serve as public parks and as a buffer to natural fire and flood systems, as well as urban traffic congestion.&nbsp; They suggested the arcadian Los Angeles Riverbed area, which regularly flooded, could be turned into a public greenbelt for recreation that would, in times of flooding, serve to absorb the river&rsquo;s overflow.&nbsp; Tragically, nearly every suggestion made by the Olmsted firm was ignored and the LA River was finally paved over (Davis 161-165).&nbsp; Today the Los Angeles River is an ugly barren channel that looks like a vast cement sewer running through the city.&nbsp; Ralph Cornell, in 1941, at a symposium of the region&rsquo;s leading architects and planners, lamented: &ldquo;no other metropolitan center has been so effective&hellip;in the obliteration of the natural beauty of its site, in the mutilation of its scenic resources&rdquo;

I know it well, having myself grown up in Southern California&mdash;coincidentally born on Spicer&rsquo;s birthday, January 30th, five years after his death.&nbsp; Like Spicer I grew up haunted by the loss which troubles that landscape.&nbsp; Beautiful as it is&mdash;and successful as it has been in promoting itself as the home of sunshine and surfing, beautiful people and flashy cars&mdash;there is something deeply sorrowful and mournful scratching at the window just at the edge of the social field of vision.&nbsp; It is a landscape that is not simply haunted by ghosts of the past but by a lost world that was erased&mdash;wiped out and paved over&mdash;in the blink of an historical eye.&nbsp; This strange and grating absence is palpable everywhere despite the lack of historical concern which predominates at every level of social life in the area.&nbsp; It is a place where the history made visible in social spaces and the history taught in schools is, overwhelmingly, either imported from Europe or the East Coast.&nbsp; </p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">When I was growing up our teachers would decorate the walls of our classrooms with symbols of foreign weather patterns: fall leaves in autumn, snowflakes in winter, and tulip bulbs in spring.&nbsp; Only a few imported tree species actually lose their leaves in the fall in Southern California where it is typically sunny and warm even during the winter.&nbsp; It never snowed.&nbsp; Once, in 1976, it hailed enough to partially cover the ground with white for half an hour or so.&nbsp; I was thrilled.&nbsp; On the one hand it pleased me so deeply because it was such a bizarre occurrence but there was a part of me that quite simply felt a joyous relief&mdash;I was relieved that my home ecosystem seemed, for once, to have behaved appropriately like the weather in our reading primers, like the snowflakes on our classroom walls.&nbsp;

When the city that would become Los Angeles was first settled, plans for the pueblo were laid out on paper by men who had never seen the site, based on a report given by missionaries who had visited for less than a full day.&nbsp; The state of California itself is named after a fantastic city rich in treasure from a Spanish romance novel.&nbsp; By 1925, the Aboriginal peoples of Los Angeles and their cultures had been supplanted by others from all over the globe.&nbsp; Many languages&mdash;English, Spanish, Chinese, among numerous others&mdash;were commonly spoken, though the language and landscape of the Tongva and Chumash had nearly disappeared.&nbsp; Though descendents of the Aboriginal peoples still live in the Los Angeles area today and hold tenaciously to their culture, their presence, unfortunately, is hardly recognized by the culture at large.&nbsp; Both their culture and their valley were in some fundamental sense overwhelmed within a few years of the arrival of the first Americans.&nbsp; </p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">When I was young abalone covered the coastlines;

And finally, this longing for unification of self serves as the primary tool of phallic culture to coerce capitulation.</p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Though the self/world in the mirror is a mere reflection, it appears from an internal vantage more &ldquo;real&rdquo; than the world experienced directly.&nbsp; The internal world of the self is fragmented and confusing; whereas the reflected image of the self and the world in which it is spatially located appears whole, unified, and coherent.&nbsp; It is through the fantastical processes of imagination that we are able to fashion an internal self to match the external image of self seen in the mirror.&nbsp; We desire the mirrored self and seek to follow it, to leave behind the absurdities of our internal confusions and desires.&nbsp; The self in the mirror is something like the world Walt Whitman reflects in his poetry&mdash;lovable, stable, having purpose.&nbsp; Whereas the invisible, unreflected experience of self is more like Spicer&rsquo;s&mdash;it is the rabbit hole underworld of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> or Dorothy in the Land of Oz&mdash; a landscape of confusion and uncertainty in which Spicer locates himself.&nbsp; </p>    <p align="justify"><span class="doublespaceStandardText">The idea that there is a coherent subject inside each of us that can see the world and know it (the Cogito), serves not only as the root of authority&rsquo;s power over us, but also to banish the multiple voices/selves that inhabit our being.&nbsp; Spicer in his poetry and poetics figures the self as a formidable figment of the imagination become actual.&nbsp; The self is an impediment that when displaced (a very dangerous business) clears a channel for other selves/souls/beings to move through.&nbsp; As Emily Dickinson says in her famous letter: &ldquo;Nature is a haunted house, poetry a house that tries to be haunted&rdquo; (236).&nbsp; The work of the poet is to <i>try </i>to be haunted&mdash;to write a poem in which the dead can speak.&nbsp; Spicer makes clear, perhaps more vividly than any other American poet, one must &ldquo;try&rdquo; very hard, and the stakes are extremely high.&nbsp; As he says on his deathbed (Spicer died when he was only forty years old, but was mistaken by the hospital staff for an old man): &ldquo;my vocabulary did this to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; To create the ground for such haunting is both frightening and dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>    <p class="TITLE2"><i>III.
