I'm impatient to meet the storms. The first raindrops are pearls or bullets as I run home to find martinis on the porch, already poured.&nbsp; The alcohol is like the half-light bleaching passing cars.&nbsp; You are with me all the time and I miss you, with these olives in my glass, the double rainbow, and the rattling in my heart, a downpour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText"><i>Birds</i></p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Intractable shift, clinging odor, chemical composition of speech leaving finger marks on their wings by our cradling.&nbsp; Baby birds are full of fear from what we think is right for them.

Lawrence&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Horse Trader&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; heart-pounding dreams, and the distinct image of words literally seeing ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; The poem itself is an interplay of stones and voices, sight and language with condemnation and desire.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText"><strong>Note:</strong> Amina Lawal thankfully had her sentence overturned in 2004 and is now free. I do not doubt that the written word helped to save her life--the influx of Amnesty International letters during that time was truly amazing, as well as the press coverage.</p>      <hr>      <p align="left" class="TITLE2">Working note to &lsquo;Presences&rsquo;</p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Normally, we think of political law or religious law tallying our moral comportment.&nbsp; Codified law.&nbsp; Its placement is, for the most part, rigid and severe.&nbsp; It is blocked off in courts and tablets, numbered and itemized. I&rsquo;m interested in the concept of morality, especially with the binary opposition of right and wrong, and from where it descends, the possibilities of its location.&nbsp; So I apply that binary structure, right and wrong, to such things as ghosts and ladybugs, grief and rainstorms to blow it up a bit, to say, hey wait, how can we think of things this way, right and wrong, it&rsquo;s not so easy, it&rsquo;s open and things outside of us keep opening it more.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to find a morality that proceeds from the sensual, from an erotic justice.&nbsp; </p>    <hr>    <p align="justify" class="makeSingleSpacedBiog"><b>Claire Barbetti</b> is a student, teacher, writer, editor and mother.
