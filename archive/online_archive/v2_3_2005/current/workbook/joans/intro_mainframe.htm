Howe comments, &ldquo;One thing we share in common is that we were born on the cusp of World War II.&nbsp; Childhood imagination then, even if you were an American child, encompassed such a violent world view&mdash;barked orders, bombs, swastikas, marching soldiers, newsreel shots of children being torn from their parents, such fear everywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Howe was in fact responsible for suggesting two texts important for Jonas' work, the book of fairy tales <em>The Juniper Tree </em>and H.D.'s <em>Helen in Egypt.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; In utilizing H.D.'s text <em>Helen in Egypt</em> in her <em>Lines in the Sand</em>, Jonas transforms her earlier female archetype, Organic Honey, an &quot;electronic erotic seductress&quot; into her own version of H.D.'s Helen, who according to an alternative ancient source taken up by H.D. in her <em>Helen in Egypt</em> never went to the Trojan War but resided in Egypt. </p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">In a review of the exhibition, <em>New York Times </em>reviewer Roberta Smith commented &ldquo;Anyone who is interested in the art of the last 30 years&mdash;or the next 30&mdash;should see the excellent, long overdue survey of Joan Jonas&rsquo; work . . . . Its revelations are almost guaranteed to knock you sockless.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; She later went on to single out the retrospective as one of the most important art exhibits of the year.&nbsp; The exhibition just recently received First Place Award for Best Exhibition on Time Based Art from the International Association From Art Critics. Valerie Smith curated the exhibition and arranged for the 160-page exhibition catalogue.</p>    <p class="doublespaceStandardText"><strong><a href="exchange.htm" target="_parent">Enter <em>An Exchange between Joan Jonas, Susan Howe and Jeanne Heuving</em></a></strong></p>    <hr>    <p align="justify" class="makeSingleSpacedBiog">&nbsp;</p>    <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">      <tr>        <td width="25%"><p><img src="media/jonas_biog.jpg" width="150" height="200"></p>          <p class="indexIndivExplain">Joan Jonas, <a href="http://www.queensmuseum.org/exhibitions/jonas.htm" target="_blank"><em>An Improvisation</em></a>, at Queens Museum of Art, New York, March 20, 2004 (photo by Jaishri Abichandani).</p>          </td>        <td width="75%"><div align="justify"><span class="makeSingleSpacedBiog"><strong>Joan Jonas</strong> was born in 1936 in New York, where she currently lives and works.&nbsp; Jonas is a pioneer of video / performance art.&nbsp; Her experiments and productions in the late 1960s and 1970s were essential to the formulation of the genre.&nbsp; In the late 1960's, Jonas danced and performed with Tricia Brown, Lucinda Childs, Simone Forti, and Yvonne Rainier, and later acted with the Wooster Group.&nbsp; Her work has been exhibited at major museums in the United States and Europe including The Museum of Modern Art&nbsp; and The Whitney Museum of Art in New York, the University Art Museum in Berkeley, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and the Stadtsgalerie in Stuttgart.&nbsp; She has received multiple awards, including grants from National Endowment for the Arts, Guggenheim Foundation, and Rockefeller Foundation.&nbsp; She is on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</span></div></td>      </tr>    </table>        <p align="justify" class="makeSingleSpacedBiog">&nbsp;</p>    <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">      <tr>        <td width="25%"><img src="media/howe.jpg" width="150" height="200"></td>        <td width="75%"><div align="justify"><span class="makeSingleSpacedBiog"><strong>Susan Howe </strong>was born in 1937 in Boston and resides in Guilford, Connecticut.&nbsp; Howe's cross genre works were formative of experimental modes loosely grouped under the name of &quot;language-oriented poetry&quot; in the 1970's through the 1990's, and remain definitive for avant garde practices today.&nbsp; She is the author of multiple books of poetry and scholarship, and is the recipient of many awards and honors.&nbsp; Her recent works include <em>The Midnight,Pierce-Arrow, </em>and <em>Frame Structures.</em>&nbsp; Her book <em>The Birth-Mark: Unsettling the Wilderness in American Literary History </em>was named an &quot;International Book of the Year&quot; by the <em>Times Literary Supplement.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>She was elected as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 2000 and was a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1998.&nbsp; She is the Samuel P.
