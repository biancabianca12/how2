Stylishly designed by founding codirector Marissa Newell and edited by Brett Dionysius and Paul Hardacre, <em>papertiger #4</em> is a winning mix of poetry, innovative writing, interviews, flash animation, audio work and digital art.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">For this issue Melbourne-based writer Melissa Ashley has guest-edited a selection of contemporary Australian women&rsquo;s poetry called <strong>&lsquo;Put On Your Red Shoes And Dance&rsquo;</strong> presenting work by Pam Brown, Joanne Burns, MTC Cronin, Lidija Cvetkovic, Kate Fagan, Diane Fahey, Jayne Fenton-Keane, Kristin Hannaford, Jennifer Harrison, Dominique Hecq, Cate Kennedy, Bronwyn Lea, Emma Lew, Kate Middleton, Gina Mercer, Melissa Petrakis, Alicia Sometimes [audio], Michelle A. Taylor and Louise Waller. <em>papertiger</em> editor Dionysius calls Ashley&rsquo;s selection &ldquo;a reality check on the muses&rdquo; and observes: &ldquo;There is an agreed dissatisfaction amongst the poems toward a lackadaisical approach to the lyric moment. Indeed, &lsquo;the moment&rsquo; is often undermined in this collection and set on its head.&rdquo;</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">In another arresting feature, Mark Pirie has assembled <strong>&lsquo;50 Poems by 50 Poets: Recent New Zealand Poetry&rsquo;</strong> including work by Riemke Ensing, Michele Leggot, Helen Rickerby, Jenny Powell-Chalmers, Amelia Nurse, Emily Dobson and many others.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">This brave publication has paved a way for cross-national digital explorations of experiment, and picks up tracks that were set down light-years ago by printed poetry broadsides. A comment on the <em>papertiger media</em> site reads: &ldquo;Not quite a journal, not really an anthology, not a CD of &lsquo;spoken word&rsquo; poetry to play on your hi-fi, and absolutely not a book, the <em><a href="http://www.papertigermedia.com/cdroms/default.html#papertiger" target="_blank">papertiger: new world poetry</a></em> CDROM didn&rsquo;t fit comfortably into any existing publishing category. Instead, it quickly established its own style, focus and reputation as a totally unique, high-quality hybrid of poetry journal-anthology-CD-book; a venue for the innovative, the compelling and the transformative.&rdquo; Check out the website to read more about various zippy spin-off projects that cluster under the capacious and lushly-designed <em>papertiger</em> umbrella.</p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText"><a href="http://www.papertigermedia.com/cdroms/pt04.html" target="_blank">http://www.papertigermedia.com/cdroms/pt04.html</a></p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>    <hr>    <p align="left"><a href="intro.htm" target="_parent">Alerts Index </a></p>    <p align="left"><a href="../index.htm" target="_parent">Table of contents</a></p>    <hr>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div align="center">      <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">        <param name="movie" value="../home_images/navbar.swf">        <param name=quality value=high>        <embed src="../home_images/navbar.swf" quality=high pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>      </object>    </div></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
