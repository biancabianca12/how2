The tenor of these poems is grueling and uncompromising, refusing the sentimentality of even one word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nostalgia blubbering at the freshly plucked trees&hellip;&rdquo;</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">All pleasantries are undressed.&nbsp; There is no escape for the white dinner jacket or the silk brocade.&nbsp; It is hard to even imagine anything pretty or fine at all.&nbsp; Which is not to say that there is no charm in these pages.&nbsp; The book is spell binding in its relentless presentation of creation: eggs or Dolly the sheep, fruit or people.&nbsp; Creation is made creation is marketed.&nbsp; And the relationship between choice and action is remarkable.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not as though she&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;ha ha we are fools we don&rsquo;t choose anything.&rdquo; On the contrary, there is simply no room for this make-yourself-who-you-are concept in this roller coaster of a work.&nbsp; This out of control feeling in the pieces stems I think from Morrison&rsquo;s use of repetition of phrase and form in dizzying twists. And then there are the tropes like &ldquo;bloodied pee hole&rdquo; and the &ldquo;nippled floor&rdquo; which I cannot get out of my head.</p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">In the end it is terribly sad.&nbsp; It is sad not for one but all, a universal horror of product, production and what we have become or have always been.&nbsp; And there is compassion here: the work is invested in its discourse, the work is a part of its discourse. It owns the undergarment worn.</p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>    <hr>    <p align="justify" class="makeSingleSpacedBiog"><b>Sarah Anne Cox</b> is the author of two chapbooks, <i>Home of Grammar</i> (Double Lucy 1997) and <i>definite articles</i> (a+bend 1999) and a book, <i>Arrival</i> (Krupsaya 2002).
