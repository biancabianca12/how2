Absence is something like that. To leave evidence. I see it. By rolling the world back. The way the cat ran up the wall and escaped out of the window. The wind that came in just as the cat left knocked down everything it touched by reversing time, from the small past in which the cat had disappeared, toward the present. The wind, having substantially disturbed the proper position of a light letter on the desk, has now passed by. And it is no longer here. Jay and I are contained in the room. And yet, the room feels vacant, somehow. Am I here? Clearly exist here? I am passing through it. I will become absent.</p>        <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">From the open window I hear the sounds of the neighbor&rsquo;s house. Why aren&rsquo;t you finishing your homework? The noise of plates. Would you come here and help me a bit? The noise of plates. What did you do with that? The noise of a washing machine. The soft ringing of a telephone. Hello, hello? Hello, hello? The beep signaling that the washing machine finished its work. We don&rsquo;t know the faces of our neighbors. Nonetheless, they come in. Like a flood. Our neighbors&rsquo; daily routines, into this vacant room.</p>        <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Jay and I turn on music. A brief conversation. Sexual intercourse. Laughter. The sound of slapping flesh. Two people cursing each other. These noises, too, slowly go out. Toward our neighbor&rsquo;s house. Unobtrusively, directly. We languidly blend with one another, with voices alone. On the ground separating us ivy leaves overgrow.</p>        <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">The Sunday morning when I leave Jay&rsquo;s room. There is Jay&rsquo;s room where I no longer am. I don&rsquo;t leave a single footprint, but my invisible fingerprints are imprinted everywhere. Nights, I think of the room. I peer out of the window. I see the absences of myself and the cat. Jay is a man who is part of that room. His long body tightly coiled into hardness, he, the penis of the room, is quietly asleep. I stretch my hand and touch the room. The wall is soft. I push the room harder, and the room goes out of the room. The room that contains nothing, except Jay, at first with some bounce, like a soap bubble, goes out of the hard room, slowly.</p>        <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>        <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>        <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText"><span class="TITLE2"><a name="reverb"></a>In the midst of reverberations</span>        </p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p class="doublespaceStandardText">(Eb)</p>        <p class="doublespaceStandardText">on a road after rain<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="12" height="5">there is a dark pool<br>  in the shallow water<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="12" height="5">an elm tree is wavering<br>  a dead leaf<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="12" height="5">flutters down into it<br>  falling from a tree<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="12" height="5">trying to reach the tree<br>  the dead leaf<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="12" height="5">is mercilessly rejected by the water&rsquo;s surface<br>          ripples spread like anxiety<br>          <a name="foot1"></a>(I saw: bamboo &amp;
