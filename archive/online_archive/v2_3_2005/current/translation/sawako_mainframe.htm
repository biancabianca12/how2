Most of the poets included have been somewhat canonized into the contemporary fabric, while others, like Akiko Fujiwara, are less established as household names. I am impressed with Malinda Markham for discovering (by scouring countless magazines and journals of poetry) Fujiwara&rsquo;s beautiful and strange poetry, even before the publication of her first book (forthcoming in 2005 from Shoshi Yamada). Fujiwara&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;The Day of First-Light,&rdquo; employs an old-school musicality of the Japanese language &ndash; it is the sort of poem that is particularly difficult to translate, sharing some of the difficulties of translating haiku (such as that of recreating inherently Japanese sounds), with contemporary complications. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Fujiwara, along with Hinako Abe and Kyong-Mi Park, are some of the more experimental poets featured in this section &ndash; which also means that they are difficult to import into an English-language, web-based publication. Other poems by Abe are visually unconventional, and will hopefully be translated and published in print this year. Many of Park&rsquo;s poems make heavy use of various nuances in spoken Japanese, which make them challenging to translate. The poem &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; on the other hand, captures her filmic, prose-like tableaus which can disguise its sharp edges under a subtle, tender guise.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Toshiko Hirata and Yoko Isaka, along with Hiromi Ito (featured in the Fall 2001 issue of HOW2), are major figures representing the feminist poetry movement in the 80s, whereas Masayo Koike has grown prominent in this respect in more recent years. The selection of Isaka&rsquo;s poems trace a path through her career: &ldquo;Voice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Night Sheep&rdquo; were published in 1984, &ldquo;Powdered Snow&rdquo; in 1990, while the last poem, &ldquo;Boxed Panthers,&rdquo; is the title poem from her newest book, published in 2003 by Shichosha. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Takarabe Toriko, now over 70 years old, is considerably older than the other poets included in this section. Her childhood in Manchuria &ndash; while it was occupied by the Japanese during WWII &ndash; figures largely in her poetry. She has also made many important contributions in translating Chinese poetry into Japanese.</p>      <hr>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">* Note: after this issue, the translation section will move on to feature writing from other countries and languages (hopefully more from Asia), but I will continue to actively seek and publish translations of contemporary Japanese poetry through Factorial <a href="http://www.factorial.org/" target="_blank">http://www.factorial.org</a>.
