Dangling a teabag. We&rsquo;ve not spoken in a while. A brother-like person asks is this purple flower a kind of primrose.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">The leaves of the flower are pale. Full of emotion, I am far on the other side of the window. Here I see pigeons and crows. Because there are always cake crumbs. The tea is not fragrant but it is hot and I am steeped in it.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">I saw his small feet first. I was there at my sister&rsquo;s delivery. I made him cry. Fun-ny. But I couldn&rsquo;t relax until he clamped down on her breast. The baby&rsquo;s gotta cry.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">A beautiful gaze only for a moment. Reflecting very much my inclination to talk. People&rsquo;s words flow, the way water has weight. Brown eyes, unable to go through with these careful words, I only see myself. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Very relieved. Very. Something to smoke sitting on the bookshelf in the room. Enjoying himself, throwing smiles at his siblings&rsquo; conversation. The leaves of the flowers are pale. The potted obconica closes its eyes, opens its ears. Babyishness of the baby boy.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">Mustard color suits you, a hand-me-down jacket from my brother, this is very good, such a cute little brat. We always ran slow, but we weren&rsquo;t being chased or anything, us girls. The inclination to speak, very much wanting to laugh. Pigeons and crows, a man, my eyes are near.</p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">The yellow sets, a deep brightness, it&rsquo;d be fine to be crushed while living. Push your eyes out of the way now. I&rsquo;m carefully breaking apart. Are you full of emotion. I am far on the other side of the window. Here I look at one petal of Mexican Violet at a time, still here.</p>    <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>    <hr>    <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">      <tr>        <td><div align="justify"><b><img src="media/park_by_risaku_suzuki.jpg" width="100" height="150" align="left"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="20" height="150" align="left"><span class="makeSingleSpacedBiog">Kyong-Mi Park </span></b><span class="makeSingleSpacedBiog">(b. 1956) is a second-generation Korean living and writing in Tokyo.
