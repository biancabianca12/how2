Mr Tan sat us down.<br>      I cocked my head up with a scrawny neck.<br>      He looked at his report. Smiled at me, said<br>      I was Number Two in the class. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Two years later, Roger had his name broadcasted to the assembly.<br>  He&rsquo;d topped his level and the entire school. Tried to keep up, I thought, but he beat me to it. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">His was the final year of a now defunct primary school<br>      before it made way for a retirement home.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">IV</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Roger followed me to secondary school.<br>      He trumpeted tunefully to the band<br>      while I marched weekends off to the student cadet corps, head<br>      under beret and hairnet, perspiring in the noon heat; </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">lamenting how I had spent Friday nights polishing boots<br>      to shine the nose of an inspecting senior. In my third year, my article fought its way to the annual school book while </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">first-year Roger had his in there<br>      winning a writing competition.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">V</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">In junior college, I was off my head scrawling verses on foolscap<br>      as the GP teacher droned on about the SAT and the Chinese teacher scolded everybody about nothing. Smash Hits trivia topped<br>      my must-know and I cried non-stop of failed crushes. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">I discovered religion, prayed feverishly and trotted off to every<br>      church invite, then lost it all again. Saved then damned, I oscillated<br>      from heaven&rsquo;s favour like quicksand. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Only on the annual family meets do I bump into Roger, reed thin,<br>      inching too tall for his size, doing well in school as usual.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">VI</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Roger&rsquo;s mom asked: is it true, polytechnic graduates could end up<br>  in university? She wanted him to learn something &lsquo;useful&rsquo;. I said, yes,<br>  but why offer the family&rsquo;s best brain to a technical education?<br>  Roger&rsquo;s braininess was a gift, an amalgamation of</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">many gifts others could only dream of. I hung up the phone.<br>      Crept out for <i>nasi lemak</i> at the 24-hour restaurant where undergrads swarm past midnight and forgot all about the call.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Roger went for his first choice and got in. He believed his brain<br>        had space left for theory after the practical.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">VII</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">We surrounded the bed the way the bushes had encircled our preadolescent hideout. Some strangers came. Made a lot of noise.<br>      Some mumbo jumbo about laying their hands on him.<br>      By then, it was too late for paracetemol.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">The ammonia of the ward reminded me of the hair perm solution<br>      my Mommie always used. The leader of the cult placed his palm on<br>      the bedridden boy. The strangers followed suit. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Roger&rsquo;s fever had boiled him into a coma. His religion forbade him<br>      from taking medication. This will be his finest battle.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">VIII</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">In theory, the faith of Roger&rsquo;s religion dictates a healing light would impart from the community of the blessed converts towards<br>      the weak and ailing. Roger would triumph, as he always did.<br>      His mother had faith; and so did he.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">The doctors said he would live. The fever had entered his head.<br>  Roger&rsquo;s faith kept his body alive but killed his brain. This was<br>            good news, the strangers said. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">I remember my uncles and aunts turning their heads away. Ah Pa kept<br>      a stiff upper lip while Mommie beat her chest and wept.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">IX</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Ten years now. I have not seen Roger since. This was paltry victory.<br>      I wanted Roger to beat me hands down, knock me to the ground,<br>      waving his GI Joe the way he used to. This is a fluke shot.<br>      I wanted to arm wrestle him till he bawls.</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Five hours away from the flight, I pulled out a paper coppered<br>      with age. There was Roger; mischievous hair sticking out<br>      spike-like. He had an elfin grin. His eyes sparkled. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">I gave Roger&rsquo;s winning story to Mommie, saying, give this to him.<br>      Though I doubt he can read what he once wrote. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">X</p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Mommie tells me stories: Roger&rsquo;s doing really well.<br>      He does handicraft, you know, to help bring income for the<br>      special school. He&rsquo;s made new friends and settling in his new home.<br>      But I don&rsquo;t think he recognizes me. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">I don&rsquo;t think Roger will recognize me either. Or the old him in my memory. He&rsquo;s moved forward but I&rsquo;ve stayed back, staking claim over<br>  the secret clearing at Grandpa&rsquo;s <i>kampong</i>. </p>      <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Roger faces his present &ndash; amnesiac, brave. I remember the things<br>      I want and forget the rest. I am a ghost.
