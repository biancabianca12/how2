I heard them coo and tap from high branch to low,<br>        the smaller ones need not flap their wings as they are lifted by<br>        the wind. Their movements <i>tcch, tsssh; </i>secrets bound then<br>        bounced off webbed feet. Do you know the dried silver<br>        of dead fish is a tad brighter than they swim? I spotted one<br>        and walked by but the second one I got to stop. I wanted to share<br>        with you a special insight that perhaps the world may pass by<br>        <i>nonchalant</i>. Its pout on one side stiffened to a still, its beady eye could be<br>        a fresh seed or a spoilt gem. The fin flagged its final fling. Not the royal crunch<br>        of maggots, the sparse flesh was beginning to draw in a laidback crowd<br>        of red-black ants and lazy flies. That&rsquo;s about all you&rsquo;ll get<br>        for life in the lake. Oh<br>        but that silver! I bite at the likeness of something meek, fearing yet<br>        wanting something big.</p>      <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">Do you know the crow is in fact the most devoted bird? She sings of evil and<br>        casts the grim scowl, everyone assumes. But the crow always goes back<br>        like a beautiful haunting, nursing her young whose first instincts<br>        is love. Back home we never shoot down piety but we don&rsquo;t know much<br>        to glorify a black bird. In a Chinese home, everything belongs to an altar and more red is<br>        more luck. So much has happened to me. <i>I want to share.<br>        </i>Don&rsquo;t take away the early part.
