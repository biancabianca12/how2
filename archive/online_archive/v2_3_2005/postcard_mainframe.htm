She was eighty-five years old.</p>      <p>Born in North Carolina, Barbara Guest spent most of her early life in California, where she gradated from Berkeley in 1943. Shortly thereafter, she moved to New York and became part of the community of artists and writers that became known as The New York School. But her poetics reached beyond this immediate coterie. <u>Herself Defined: The Poet H.D. and her World</u>, her 1984 biography of Hilda Doolittle (whose daughter, Perdita, was a life-long friend) helped to unpin this poet from Ezra Pound's <em>imagiste</em> label. She read widely in literature and philosophy, often turning to nineteenth-century writers such as Kant and Coleridge (she was never dissuaded from the idea of the imagination as crucial to poetic work). Like others in her generation of poets, she wrote art criticism and collaborated with visual artists, among them Grace Hartigan, Mary Abbott, Anne Dunn and Richard Tuttle.</p>      <p>In many ways, in the best sense, Barbara Guest was “a poet's poet” an artist whose work was and is known and admired above all by those who practice it. In her case, this knowledge and admiration seemed to grow outward, as if her work were at the center of a series of concentric circles with ever-widening diameters. If she began her poetic life as a member of the first generation New York School , she ended it as an altogether singular artist whose work has become seminal for innumerable poets in the generations that followed. There is little doubt that the fulcrum of her initial impact was on women writers committed to an innovative poetics, grounded in modernist possibilities, whose work resisted both overt feminism and formally reductive post-modern schemas.</p>      <p>As the lyric and its suspect I-based narratives came under increasing disdain among the most explorative poets of the 1970 and 80s, Barbara Guest's work offered a route around the suspect banalities of a simplistic subjective “voice”. More than any other poet of her generation, Guest found an integrity of line based not so much on the Olsonian model of breath as on, say, Kandinsky's drawings or Stravinsky's dissonant yet melodic phrasing. She once remarked to me that she thought the most important value in a poem was “mystery”, by which she meant something more than mere Surrealist strangeness or surprise; neither gothic miasma, nor spiritual, existential doubt, but what I take to be a fundamental phenomenological wonder. In her work, this wonder is the condition of both an imaginative virtuosity of presence, and a cool tonal detachment. </p>      <p>One wants to say that, among her early poet associates--- Schuyler, Koch, Ashbery, O'Hara --- Barbara Guest was the poet with the most powerful investment in abstraction as a formal principle that could allow sensuous and conceptual frames to intersect, blur, and inform each other. Unlike O'Hara, she did not opt for a persona; unlike Ashbery, she did not split the self into a congregation singing the same polyphonic hymn; she was closest in temperament to Schuyler, whose absorption in the details of visuality found some affinity with her own. But for Guest, the visible was rarely stabilized as observed image, it was instead a kind of temporal/spatial index of the fluxual instability of language and perception. This realized itself in currents of inflection and perspective that weave linear and non-linear elements into intersecting, dazzling arcs. As Charles Bernstein pointed out, in his 1999 talk to celebrate Guest's receiving the Frost Medal for Lifetime Achievement, her work was continually “testing the limits of form”. </p>      <p>Guest's late work is capable of a precision so liberated and austere that it verges on a kind of essential riddle, in which thinking and perceiving become annealed to each other even as they appear to witness divergent paths. Her output was nothing short of astounding: starting in 1989 with <u>Fair Realism</u>, from Sun &amp; Moon, she produced more than a dozen works of poetry and criticism, sometimes more than one book in a year. This sustained productivity was testament to both her fierce concentration and her evolved, unswerving ambition for poetry. What finally gives her work its significance is, at least for me, its profound insistence on, and evidence of, the poem as a necessary human artifact. </p>      <p>The gracious and persevering maker has left us, but what she made will challenge and enlarge our world for a long time to come.</p>      <p><span class="doublespaceStandardText">[<a href="http://how2journal.com/bg_memorybank/bg_memory.html#lauterbach" target="_parent"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to view Ann Lauterbach's tribute in the How2 memory bank.]</span></p>      <hr>      <p class="TITLE2">22 March 2006</p>      <p>Rosmarie Waldrop</p>      <p class="TITLE2">FOR BARBARA GUEST, 1920-2006</p>      <p align="justify" class="normalText">Where language stops matter begins. Of words. The simple contact with a wooden spoon. I don’t easily give up on the uncertainties that might, if only for a moment, alleviate grief. But time is perishable. I believe. A sense of consciousness comes precisely. From the flow of perceptions. Relations of warfare and polka dots. And you cannot twice capture the flash of identity between subject and object.</p>      <p align="justify" class="normalText">The poem begins in silence, you wrote, mystery, wild gardens, pitch within the ear, chalk, rivulets, shifting persona, shuffling light.</p>      <p align="justify" class="normalText">As long as we’ve not reached, as in a dream, the fibrous, woody substance of words. We are prisoners. Of narratives in the room. Sprawling to consider an emphasis falls. On reality. Neither thick lids nor vowels inclement can obstruct the transparency of the dragonfly’s wings. While the brain establishes consciousness through stimuli occurring not more than a twenty-fourth of a second apart. You occupy the lotus position.</p>      <p align="justify" class="normalText">The poem is fragile, you wrote, the contour elusive, ropes sway, heavy violets, galactic rhythm, sibilants, solitude edged, upward from the neck, provokes night.</p>      <p align="justify" class="normalText">When approaching death we cannot go into the matter of darkness. Viewed on the screen of distance, your shadow rephrased. Forbids the instant disclosure. The necessary night entangled in the folds of preoccupation until the next bold seizure of dawn. It is the connecting between moments—not the moments themselves — that is consciousness. Field broken by low running water, dour sky, the earth in twists moving like the water into the body—is memory of self.</p>      <p align="justify" class="normalText">The poem is a resume, you wrote, of impalpable vision, the <em>clair-obscur</em> of thought, a brown mouse, twilight soup, the figure appears, adoptive day, scorched tongue, the edge, always.</p>      <p align="justify" class="normalText">After your death we find matter. For many fine tales about your life. And work. The speculative use of minerals, like beryl, to prevent attachment to words from overflowing. To catch the fraction of a second when the seam of present and future is visible in the flash of the lizard, its flight. Loss requires restructuring all of our consciousness, our relation to sunrise. And giving way to the emotions.</p>      <p align="justify" class="normalText">The poem draws blood, you wrote, kicks away the ladder, rose marble table, folds of skin, mirrors, fans, nimble wind, multiplied by frost, the rage of night.</p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">[<a href="http://how2journal.com/bg_memorybank/bg_memory.html#waldrop" target="_parent"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to view Rosmarie Waldrop's tribute in the How2 memory bank.]</p>      <hr>      <p align="justify" class="TITLE2"><a name="rosenwasser"></a>22 March 2006</p>      <p align="left" class="normalText">Rena Rosenwasser</p>      <p align="left" class="TITLE2">Guest’s Musicality: My recollection of the collaborative process</p>      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left"><em>MUSICALITY</em> was produced in 1988 on a letterpress. The drawings were printed offset, but the text was hand set with old fashioned hard lead type. Thus there is no file document on the Kelsey Street Press computer that contains the poem. </p>      <p align="left">Kelsey Street Press made a decision to honor Barbara by returning to our early roots. When the Press began in the early seventies we printed and handset all our books on an old Vandercook Press. We did this in the basement of Patricia Dienstfrey's home on Kelsey St., in Berkeley, CA.. By 1988 the Press no longer was printing on letterpress, nor was it situated in Patricia's basement. </p>      <p align="left">In 1987 we hired Peter Koch to print <em>MUSICALITY </em>at his Oakland letterpress shop. I went there over a repeated period to set the type. This was done, letter by letter, in Bodoni metal type. The process provided me with an intimate relationship to the text, and to the spaces (leading) between the words and lines. I did this directly from the pages of Barbara's manuscript [see <a href="http://how2journal.com/bg_memorybank/bg_memory.html" target="_parent">BG Memory Bank</a>, for final text of <em>MUSICALITY</em>]. The poem appears in the book as she spatially expressed it on her typed page. <br>        .<br>        <u>My recollection of the collaborative process</u>:</p>      <p align="left">Musicality (the poem) was inspired by a body of work by the painter, June Felter. During the 1980's, June produced a series of drawings of Sonoma County's landscape. Drives she took through the countryside inspired these sketches and watercolors. A body of gently luminous paintings also followed.</p>      <p align="left">Barbara wrote Musicality in response to the images. </p>      <p align="left">Robert Rosenwasser, my brother, and I worked on the design of the book. Our efforts were a collaboration in tandem with June and Barbara: We laid out the pages of the poem. June had a flat file in her house that contained dozens of these drawings and watercolors. Robert and I made our choices so that there would be a visual flow to the book. It took us quite a few goes before we found the perfect form. We tried to create a pacing of images to and of spaces that resonated with the measure of the poem. The text wasn't altered to align with the poetry lines, rather the images were chosen to work visually with the rhythm of the words and space. During this stage of the book neither Barbara nor June were involved. It wasn't until we‘d completed our layout that we turned to June and Barbara to see how they felt about what we had done.</p>      <hr>      <p align="justify" class="TITLE2">03 November 2005</p>      <p align="justify">from Lisa Samuels</p>      <p align="justify">What I would ask is an impossible question how we can be more 'global' than we are. An obvious question for me to ask, possibly an unfair one, since it ties in most immediately with my upcoming move to New Zealand. Which is itself not exactly Yemen, where I also lived though in my more adventuresome twenties. </p>      <p align="justify">I think of this matter today, though, because I recently heard a lovely talk whose points resonated with my interests too in opening up critical practice to less rationalist &amp; Newtonian procedures. In this case the speaker emphasized visual interpretations of conceptual imaginations: emotional weather in digital form, media permutations via art. <br>          <br>          At the end of the talk I asked how these views were received in countries outside of the U.S. and the UK, since it seems to me that rationalism and exegetical thinking are more an Anglo-American fixation than perhaps elsewhere. The speaker spoke of the reception of her ideas in France and Germany – and that was it. So I thought: she has given versions of such talks in the U.S., the UK, France, and Germany. And that's all, when she is a world-known poet, book artist, and digital media wiz? Why? <br>          <br>          One answer – perhaps the only answer – is money. <br>          <br>          After all, my future New Zealand colleagues would like to have conferences and the like on their fertile soil, and the major prevention is that fellow academics/artists outside Australia don't have big travel budgets. Where I have been teaching in the U.S., for example, there are lotteries for small amounts of cash to help with such a trip, and many persons avoid conference attendance because they cannot count on any support. <br>          <br>          But it is nigh-on impossible to 'get global' by reading magazine issues devoted to a momentary group of 'foreign' writers. Such reading is an excellent thing to do, to be sure. But it doesn't substitute for taking one's whole body to another hemisphere or continent – perhaps especially, for probable readers of How2, a non-occidental one. <br>          <br>          Money, and time. For how does one organize a life to do such heavy lifting of oneself and a retinue of some number of weeks and, perhaps, other persons?</p>      <p align="justify">So I despair of real globalism. At least in current conditions. <br>          <br>          Maybe another way to compensate, in addition to reading those 'foreign writers' issues or editions wonderfully published by devoted editors, is to find as many ways as possible to push the imagination outside of whatever western provincialism we inhabit. <br>          <br>          For one of my recent ponderings is that everywhere on earth is provincial. The problem arises when a country has too much room in which to be provincial: a master-country is a bloated provincialism.<br>          <br>          Hence Russia, the U.S., China, and their once and future lost and absorbing interiors. <br>      </p>      <p align="justify">Lisa Samuels <br>        November 1, 2005</p>      <hr>      <p align="left" class="TITLE2">18 May 2005</p>      <p align="left" class="TITLE2">Hannah Weiner’s Early and Clairvoyant Journals</p>      <p align="justify">The Archive for New Poetry at the University of California at San Diego is pleased to announce the publication of an online edition of performance artist / poet Hannah Weiner's &quot;Early and Clairvoyant Journals&quot;, edited by Patrick F.

She is happy for it to go on the postcards section of How2 if you think it of interest to others.</p>      <p align="left">All the best</p>      <p align="left">Mark Leahy</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left">--------------------</p>      <p align="justify">I just now had some carrot juice and read your talk - ... and I laughed out loud at the doughnut coming out of the suitcase!! Dash was concerned by the sudden sound - I had to assure him that it was a good noise! ... such a clear differentiation of private vs. personal ... will help me with this eco-collab I'm working on with Marcella Durand because the big criticism of it is that use of descriptions of nature reinforces the isolated private sight of those looking at nature (but we are breaking up those descriptions to remove that sense of &quot;natural bond with nature&quot; which is kind of an ownership feeling).</p>      <p align="justify">Your talk is really helping me to think about these things - also the distinction you make about my work not being into the correct identification of fossils (THANK YOU!!) has given me another idea for the eco collab - a riff on the &quot;is that a true boxwood or a faux thornberry?&quot; sort of thing. The only tiny correction is that (and you've gotten this mistake from me because I misspelled his name in &quot;RC'sS&quot;) it is Earle Stanley Gardner, not Earl, which Kevin Killian pointed out to me in the nicest way right after he read SR - Kevin should have been a librarian because he is so detail-oriented. I'm terrible, as you know, about seeing things I expect to see.</p>      <p align="justify">Another great thing in your talk - the word &quot;bildungsroman&quot; - I'm so happy not to be reinforcing that word!! What an ugly word! And I'm so glad that you bring in the part about identifying narrative as embarrassing, and that is about preset boundaries - I hadn't thought of it in that way before. Really, the whole talk is like that - I feel like I'm reading with you in all sorts of ways that I didn't &quot;intend&quot; and that is a peaceful feeling - I've let the texts be open enough for that to happen.

Having just re-read it again over the weekend, I am reminded of Inger Christensen's book 'alphabet' which Juliana&nbsp; suggested I read for her class do you know it? Perhaps it is the use of repetition in both, but I think also it is their insistence of writing the intricate relations between 'things' in and of our world into existence--that 'hashing' as in Juliana's title. I will write something about it here as soon as I get my thesis in next week, then send it off to our editor at How2. Have you thought any more about writing in to Postcards?&nbsp; Perhaps I can begin a string just with our communication as a starting point.</p>      <p align="left">All the best and thank you again for the book.</p>      <p align="left">Romney</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="TITLE2">2/12/04</p>      <p align="left">Dear Romney, </p>      <p align="justify">What's your mailing address? I'll send you a review copy of the book. I think the Postcards discussion could work through the lens of the book- Juliana as an enabler of community/utopic vision come real and also a mirror of her written work. The conference is still very fresh in my mind, there are some links and a few in particular that could be part of this discussion/format. </p>      <p align="justify">Let me think it over some more in light of your response.

I know Juliana just returned from her talk in NY, though we didn't get to talk about it much ourselves. I just returned from her class. I would love to hear from you on the subject, so please do write...thoughts, ideas, etc as you are processing it is fine too. Don't be shy when it comes to including fragments of exchanges you have on the subject with others, perhaps even Juliana or others who may weigh in on the discussion.&nbsp; </p>      <p align="justify">As for the book, let me check with Kate Fagen (How2 editor) about reviews, though she has suggested we all, here at How2, write them and submit them. I would be happy to receive it myself and write a review for How2.&nbsp; It could also stir another topic for discussion in the Postcard section.&nbsp; </p>      <p align="justify">I look forward to the 'beginnings' of a piece/or discussion as it comes about....in fragments/or disruptions is fine...as mothering is, it is so often like this. </p>      <p align="left">Best and thank you for writing. </p>      <p align="left">Romney</p>      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="TITLE2">2/11/04</p>      <p align="left">Dear Romney, </p>      <p align="justify">My name is Jane Sprague. I am a poet and publisher of Palm Press, <a href="http://www.palmpress.org" target="_blank">www.palmpress.org</a>, the recent sponsor of an exciting conference on small press publishing held in Ithaca, NY last weekend. </p>      <p align="justify">I'm writing because I'd like to send a copy of Juliana Spahr's recent book, things of each possible relation hashing against one another (Palm Press, 2003), to How2 for review purposes. Additionally, I'd like to write a piece or engage in discussion about the conference and the issues it brought up, particularly in terms of culture workers, feminism and small press publishing/community making. I am still processing much of the event (as the organizer) but feel that there is the germ of an idea or an essay somewhere in my thinking and I'm wondering how that might be explored within the context of How2. </p>      <p align="justify">Could you kindly respond when you have a chance? I am a mother and worker and full-time grad student in addition to my life as a poet, so- I know how it goes with finding time, etc. </p>      <p align="justify">Thank you very much. I anticipate hearing from you. </p>      <p align="left">Jane Sprague </p>      <p align="left"><a href="http://www.palmpress.org/" target="_blank">www.palmpress.org</a></p>      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="TITLE2">12/20/03</p>      <p align="left">from Romney Steele</p>      <p align="left">Dear Readers</p>      <p align="justify">I&rsquo;m writing to introduce myself as the new editor of Postcards. I am a second year student in the MFA program at Mills College in Oakland, CA, and was recently a student of Kathleen Fraser&rsquo;s at CCA in San Francisco. I am the mother of two children and my day job is writing and development for a small food company. I am excited to be a part of this journal and am looking forward to participating with a larger community of women writers. To help with this project and to expand the theme of community and our readership, we have enlisted fellow poet, Sun Yung Shin of Minnesota to work with us as our Midwest editor. Her engagement with the Asian writing community and her interest in cross cultural poetics brings an exciting element to the table and will hopefully encourage women from many various and diverse communities to join in the exchange. Although we have not met in person, it is my hope that together we can excite new and lively conversations, perhaps with old or recurring themes and issues, about postmodern women&rsquo;s writing and therefore open up discussions between women writers in different writing communities. What is current in women&rsquo;s writing today? What are some of the questions being asked by the new generation of women writers? And at what place do the new generation and the older generation of writers connect? What themes seem to persist across state lines and across oceans? There are many questions and many discussions to be had, and hopefully these pages will become a place for such dialogue to unfold. As we enter a new year, my wish is that the Postcard section will continue to be an active forum for women writers to discuss what&rsquo;s current in their own communities, and by writing in, expanding our notion of community and shared interests amongst our readers. Welcome to Postcards!</p>      <p align="left">Romney Steele</p>      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left" class="TITLE2">12/10/03</p>      <p align="left">from Sun Yung Shin</p>      <p align="left">Greetings from Minneapolis</p>      <p align="justify">It&rsquo;s my turn to write and introduce myself as the other new co-editor of the Postcards section alongside Romney Steele. I also have two children and they are pre-school and school aged, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to be participating in the wonderful world of How2 and women&rsquo;s poetry. Thanks go to Kathleen Fraser for inviting me to participate. I am completing a master&rsquo;s degree in education at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis, I write reviews for Xcp: cross cultural poetics and Rain Taxi Review, write and teach poetry, and am co-editing an anthology with Jane Jeong Trenka (Language of Blood, Borealis) and Julia Sudbury (Other Kinds of Dreams: Black Women&rsquo;s Organizations and the Politics of Transformation, Routledge) titled Outsiders Within: Transracial Adoptees Write on Race and Belonging. My illustrated bilingual Korean/English children&rsquo;s book Cooper&rsquo;s Lesson will be coming out in March 2004 from Children&rsquo;s Book Press (San Francisco). I&rsquo;m very interested in how poetics and poetic practices are in/formed by class, ethnicity, nationality, and one&rsquo;s material conditions &amp; location. What new directions will postmodern women&rsquo;s poetry take? Can poetry take its place in this time of &ldquo;globalization&rdquo; and corporatized-technological dominance? What issues of production and reception will or can become important? As someone on the edges (orbit?) of poetry academia I hope that the Postcards section will be a place for lively discussion, dissent, and cross-cultural exchanges.</p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>      <hr>    <p>&nbsp;</P>    <p align="center"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">      <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">        <param name="movie" value="media/navbar.swf">        <param name="quality" value="high">        <embed src="media/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>      </object>    </font></P></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
