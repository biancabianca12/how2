It is hard work to write about work when you work at a job that you don't like, especially if it is boring. I work 37.5 hours a week as a word processor in a legal office. This piece was written while I was at work--it is really a meditation on the word &quot;work,&quot; letting the language do the telling--and was composed on a computer which has a program for checking to see if you have spelled the words correctly. If it finds words it does not recognize it gives you all the alternatives it can &quot;think&quot; of or tells you that it can find none. I incorporated these mechanical choices into the text as they came up. I think the computer has funny ideas about words. Once it gave me- <i>doughnuts     </i> and      <i>toenails      </i> as two alternatives to the word      <i>doubtful.</i></p>  </div><hr><p><a HREF="jmthinking.html">Go to the text</a></p><p><a HREF="0187.htm">Go to this issue's table of contents</a>        </p><hr><p align="center">  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object></p></td></tr></table></body></html><p><p><p><p><p><p>
