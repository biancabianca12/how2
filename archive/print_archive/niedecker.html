Here evolution, housed in a museum, is an idea we walk through, meeting (as we might meet in a Marianne Moore poem) the simple creature with its gaudy latinate name.  But Niedecker doesn't choose to go on for five pages topping herself with witty ironies as Moore might do.

It is ironic that Niedecker's work, as H.D.'s, has often been reduced to a simplistic version of small perfections, whereas the work proves to be tenacious, sinewy, not merely gem-like -- a persistence of mind which finds its constant focus in the natural and domestic world.</p><p align="justify">It is also a curious phenomenon to discover, in various footnotes and memories, that there exists the mistaken notion that Niedecker's work appeared in <i>An &quot;Objectivist&quot; Anthology</i> (1932) and/or in the &quot;Objectivist&quot; issue of <i>Poetry</i> (Feb., 1931), edited by Louis Zukofsky.  It, in fact, did <i>not</i> appear.</p><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">As Carl Rakosi remembers it, Zukofsky -- who both admired and severely critiqued Niedecker's work, via their long literary correspondence -- had invited Niedecker to submit poems for the issue of <i>Poetry</i> he was editing, but her manuscript didn't arrive in time.  Largely due to the efforts of Cid Corman, poet and editor of <i>Origin</i>, her work found an audience.  Letters and poems appeared in <i>Origin</i>, 3rd series, No. 2, July, 1966, and in its 4th series, No. 16, July, 1981. <i>Truck</i>, No. 16, 1975, devoted a complete issue to Niedecker's works (see the article &quot;A Woman Poet, Specifically,&quot; by Jane Augustine, for a thoughtful discussion of poems cited above).  Two recent close readings of Niedecker poems appear in <i>Sagetrieb</i>, Vol. 1, No. 2, Fall, 1982.</font><p><font FACE="Palatino">-- K.F., F.J., B.
