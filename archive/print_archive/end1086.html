The exciting part of the palimpsest notion is that some of the imperfectly erased writing from ancient female texts and myths still comes through--bits and pieces of language, single words, alphabet fragments whose traces and marks suggest the challenge of coded hermetic messages, both from recovered past writings    <i> and  </i> from one's own unconscious.&quot;* </div><div align="justify">  <p><i>HOW(ever)      </i>  celebrates H.D.'s one-hundredth birthday with this issue of writings in which the sign, the mark, the utterance of the unconscious comes through into present voice, with ancient echoes hovering.  </p>  </div><div align="justify">Honoring the works of H.D. this fall/winter: the    <i> Emily Dickinson / H.D.
