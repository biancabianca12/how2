Also angrily. Why in all my years of lit classes did I not hear these names, read this work? By great (thank God) luck I've found women writers sharing my own concerns. Now, reading      <i> o.blek,      </i>  I find part of a series by Rosmarie Waldrop, the beginnings of which were printed in      <i> HOW(ever);      </i>  I find a chapter in a book I'm currently reading   (<i>Open   </i> <i>Form and the Feminine Imagination   </i>--by   Stephen-Paul Martin--good book, but why didn't a woman write it?) about Theresa Cha--then discover one of the issues of   <i> HOW(ever)   </i>  is devoted to her work. It is as if all these mysteriously disparate writers are suddenly IN CONTEXT, in relation to other writers of their generation, of earlier generations. . . .Those overlooked by The Canon, I'm starting to see, are not merely bypassed--they are divided and scattered--this is what makes me so angry. I am no stranger to lit classes, as I've said--why didn't I hear of these women???  </div>  <p align="justify">. . . Gertrude Stein was mentioned, but as a freak of some sort, as if she was a one-of-a-kind, instead of a precursor to the writings of contemporary women. Is it me--did I pick lousy programs? (I don't think so, a friend of mine currently at Sarah Lawrence complains too). Were women writers more well-represented in the 70's--did I just miss the boat?<p align="justify">Well, I have since found/stumbled upon the work I need to see to work--I get a horrible vertigo when I think: what if I hadn't found the means to make these connections?<p align="justify">The alerts and postcards sections are treasures--I worked for years ordering poetry books for a Cambridge bookstore and managed to represent some pretty obscure publishers<i>--HOW(ever),</i>  however, has not only news about small small presses, but addresses--what a treat!<p align="left"><i>(from Karen Kelley, to Rachel Blau DuPlessis)  </i></p><p align="center">&#149;      <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="144" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">  </p><p align="justify"><a NAME="dgpost"></a>I've always liked experimental work basically because thought patterns and natural rhythms of speech don't fit the English language.
