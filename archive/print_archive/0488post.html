Unlike H.D., who did initiate film into her style, Bryher kept her distance thinking about film in a more or less scientific manner. Although I do believe that film may possibly have given her a sense of background, the necessity for background, and a shortening of the novel form, a physical movement, in her historical novels. I have been re-reading them and some are exceedingly good. I believe she relied on Mary Renault and Henty--for an extraordinary combination. The novels were very post<i>-Borderline.  </i>  20 years.</div><p align="justify">Bryher wrote about      <i> montage      </i>  in Russian film, and she was aware that for the Russians, even more than for the Germans,      <i> cutting.      </i>  the film was far more important than actors or a director. And isn't that what you are talking about? Both Eisenstein and especially Pudovkin were intensely preoccupied with      <i> cutting      </i>  Macpherson knew this when he was making      <i> Borderline,      </i>  but the irony is that he dropped out of the film after shooting it and left Bryher and H.D. to cut it!</p><div align="justify">. . . And what video is doing to language-space is another exploration. I admire the elipses in    <i> Miami Vice    </i>  and I wonder if that program has advanced (or is an advance) scientifically (and metaphorically) from film montage.</div><p align="justify"><div align="justify">--Barbara Guest is author of    <i> Herself Defined: the Poet H.D. and Her World,    </i>  Doubleday, 1984.

We have almost finished a slight lyrical four reel little drama, done in and about the village here with some of the village people and English friends. The work has been enchanting, never anything such fun and I myself have learned to use the small projector and spend literally hours alone in my apartment making the mountains and village streets and my own acquaintances reel past me in the light and light and light. At the moment I want to go on in this medium working with and around pure types, pure artists, pure people, experimenting with faces and shadows and corners. All the light within the light fascinates me, &quot;satisfies&quot; me. I feel like a cat playing with webs and webs of silver. I should like for the moment to be what I am, to know a lot more about camera work, and to have a little more brawn for the lugging of things up hills. Yes, I should like more than anything to have some sort of workable little car that I could work myself and go off and on, on my own, more or less to Italy and wander in and about Italian and Swiss hills making light do what I want. <i></i> </p></div><p align="left"><i><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--The Little Review,   </i> May 1929<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="150" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></p><p align="center">&#149;     </p><p><div align="left"><b>Eisenstein:</b> </div><p align="justify">In his essay, &quot;The Filmic Fourth Dimension,&quot; Eisenstein elaborates on his notion of montage: </p><p align="justify">The film-frame can never be an inflexible    <i> letter of the alphabet,    </i>  but must always remain a multiple-meaning <i>ideogram.    </i>  And it can be read only in juxtaposition, just as an ideogram acquires its specific    <i> significance, meaning,    </i>  and even    <i> pronunciation    </i>  (occasionally in diametric opposition to one another) only when combined with a separately indicated reading or tiny meaning--an indicator for the exact reading--placed alongside the basic hieroglyph.</p><p align="justify"><i><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--Sergei Eisenstein,      </i> &quot;The Filmic Fourth Dimension,&quot;      <i> Film Form,    </i> Harcourt Brace &amp; World, New York, 1949. </p><hr><div align="left">  <p><a HREF="0488.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a></p>  </div><hr><p align="center">  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
