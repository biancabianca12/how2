Guest seeks to obtain multiple textures in language and uses syntax and the space of the page as a ground for re-imagining what has thus been represented to us in more traditional and recognizable modes of poetry. &quot;Roses&quot; plays with the meaning of air, as it is found in painting. It suggests air as: an atmosphere one has not felt before, &quot;a unique perfume,&quot; &quot;escape,&quot; &quot;pleasure,&quot; &quot;openings.&quot;</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">&quot;Roses&quot; is not simply a paraphraseable poem about air, but a set of suggestions constantly shifting, held together by tone. Its meaning keeps opening. The roses Guest elects are those of Juan Gris, the Cubist --dark roses bent into a harsh composition where they exist selflessly. Guest writes in the company of Stein, in her non-linear shifting from line to line, but she is less interested in pinning down a single situation or person. Whereas much of Stein's work is pushed forward by syntax and has a compulsive drive which gives it power and rhythm, Guest argues for a kind of poem that opens out into vistas or perceptual and lyric spaces. Gris' painting is a thing, a signpost which becomes a secret directive for Guest, both liberating and revealing her own structures of thought to herself and the reader. Throughout  <i>Moscow Mansions, </i> the nature of visual signification is explored, on one level becoming a manual of unique modes of painterly composition. In the long poem &quot;Knight of the Swan,&quot; lines and passages are placed and displaced, building a rich accretion of approaches to her subject, as in Cubism, where one is shown the same subject on different planes. There, she writes:</font><p align="left"><font FACE="Palatino"> </font><br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">like a building surfaced in stucco,<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">or a white machine crossing a bridge<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">or air with a cloud woven into that space where<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">a motor threads it a short black lace thickening<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">the atmosphere the way a weaver does<br><font FACE="Palatino"><div align="left"><br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">so a chivalric mood occupied the knight    <br>    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="62" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">like a hand.    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></div><p><div align="justify">In     <i>Seeking Air     </i> (Black Sparrow Press, 1978), Barbara Guest's poetic novel, the air of lyric qualities, a painterly air, occurs again. Like Japanese prints, like Mary Cassat's domestic paintings, like Bonnard's interiors,     <i>Seeking Air   </i> is filled with wild fragrance and unexpected alleys; close to a Japanese diary or &quot;pillow book&quot; and yet much more abstract, it incorporates both intimate prose and startling lyric innovation. Her characters paint each other, they describe their perceptions of each other to each other, as if saying &quot;look how I look at you&quot; were the most important phrase in the world. They put themselves in a surround where even the simplest domestic detail has lyrical meaning: </div><table width="270"><tr><td>&nbsp;  </td><td><div align="left"><font FACE="Palatino">You do leave behind you an extraordinary disorder.

Rachel Blau DuPlessis, among others, has suggested that &quot;both/and&quot; vision is a characteristic of a so-called female aesthetic. Mei-mei Berssenbrugge has the freedom such a vision would imply: she explores herself in parallel with the natural world rather than in opposition to it. She says in the poem &quot;Pack Rat Sieve&quot;: &quot;Her senses were shifting ridge-lines, their faces or wings / of varying saturation as this light was moved by clouds.&quot; It is usual in western culture to objectify the natural world; in contrast, she is making of herself a natural object. She subverts the subject/object dichotomy, while incorporating the scientific terms which have been used to give it authority. Her poetry functions as a sort of membrane through which experience and observation pass, and are transformed: </font><br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Walter calls it a dream screen<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">What appears at a certain distance on one side<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">evokes a reciprocal rose on your side of the screen<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">which is porous, allowing free flow<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">I am told, though like a television screen<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">the image seems gray dots today, flattened<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="93" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">grotesquely<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">against the glass, which has no depth itself<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">This is intimacy.<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="48" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">-from <i>Random Possession,</i> p.42<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="0" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">The &quot;objective&quot; stance of scientific language does not dominate her and thus she is free to use its descriptive power without being used by it.
