From there we claimed sixteen pages every four months--a modest proposal with which to assert our choices of the new writing being practiced by women poets unaffiliated with particular aesthetic or political ideologies yet making a poetry which, by its very art and necessity, re-examined and re-invented our sense of language, further locating varieties of female experience previewed in the works of modernist women innovators preceding us: Woolf, Richardson, Sitwell, Stein, Loy, H.D., Riding, Butts, Barnes, Niedecker, Moore.</p><p align="justify">We've often been asked for our editorial credo, but have resisted hardening into a certain &quot;aesthetic position,&quot; deciding instead to remain curious. Our points-of-focus have been taken by surprise and often determined by concerns emerging from work that arrived in the mail. <i>Lyric Proposals   </i> was first suggested by the    <i>anti-ghazals    </i> of Phyllis Webb, a Canadian poet whose work we read and admired years ago (requesting reprint rights in 1983). We waited to find other lyric genetic breaks to cluster with hers. Finally the circle has come full round with this issue. While our ear has wanted difference and our habits unbalancing, there are yet sweet aires awash with off-rhymes of inevitability and crackling with ahistoric awkward sound. . . . Sound implicating undeciphered plots, spiritual dilemmas, yawing away from an idea of beauty based on predictability and the predetermined.</p><p align="center">&#149;</p><p align="justify">After announcing in our previous issue (Vol. V, No. 3) the probable end of <i> HOW(ever)   </i> with this issue, many letters arrived begging urgent reconsideration. Two phone calls were received within the week, unknown to each other, with concrete offers of editorial energy from Myung Mi Kim (see poems in <i> H(er),   </i>  <i>    </i> Vol. IV, No. 3), and from Meredith Stricker (see poems in <i> H(er),    </i>  <i>     </i> Vol. V, No. 1, and her H.D. piece in this issue). We are delighted to announce that Meredith Stricker and Myung Mi Kim will assume guest co-editorship of <i> HOW(ever)     </i> Vol. VI, Nos. 1-4 from January, 1990 through January 1991. Myung co-edited the magazine <i> Pavement     </i> in 1986 and has published poems in <i> Ironwood, Sulfur, Calyx, f.(lip).   </i> She teaches and directs the Student Special Services at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, and immigrated to the U.S. from Korea at age nine. Meredith has collaborated on dance/language/visual performances with Elizabeth Lahey in New York City, and mixes a career of teaching, translating and editing in and around the University of Iowa, Iowa City. Her poems and critical writing have appeared in <i> Pavement, Poet &amp; Critic, Ink, Epoch, Iowa Architect, Berkeley Poetry Review. </i> Both women completed the M.F.A. in poetry at the University of Iowa Writer's Workshop. Manuscripts for Vol. VI may be submitted to them, after October 30th, at: </p><p align="justify"><i>HOW(ever)  </i> c/o Stricker &amp; Kim, 1171 East Jefferson, Iowa City, Iowa, 52240.

'At present most of what we know, or think we know, of women has been found out by men,' Helen Hoyt wrote in the avant-garde magazine <i> Others  </i> in 1916. 'We have yet to hear what woman will tell of herself, and where can she tell more intimately than in poetry?' While male poets and critics treated women's focus on self as evidence of restricted capacities and intellectual inferiority, the fact is that women were laying the groundwork for their own future development.&quot;</div><p align="justify"><div align="justify">--excerpt from Foreword,    <i> The    </i>  <i>First Wave, Women Poets in America 1915-1945    </i>  by William Drake, Macmillan, 1987. </div><p align="justify"> <div align="justify">  <p><i>HOW(ever),    </i>  <i>    </i>  ISSN 0895-5-5743, is available in a fifth series of four numbers.
