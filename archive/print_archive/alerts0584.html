These are works which seem to distill the quintessence of traditional lyric poetry, both test and recreate it by projecting the lyric into a hardly populated vastness and silence. Her work: the most scrupulous and brilliant sound; issues of transcendence and immersion as the point of view; &quot;feigning&quot; and the sincerities of artifice; an interplay between abstract thought and precisions of image; an admiration for the odd and the quirky (see Woolf's  <i>Common Reader  </i> in  <i>Cabbage Gardens, </i> with its collage from Sam Johnson to Beatrix Potter). And that subtle play between determinate meaning and indeterminacy which here offers a preternatural and (therefore?) elegiac articulateness.</font><p ALIGN="CENTER"> ° </p><div align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">Like much of Susan Howe's poetry,       <i>Secret History of the Dividing Line       </i> is set at an intersection (as the title suggests) of time and space in a particular emotional territory. Many probing uses of the meanings of       <i>mark        </i> (to notice, a visible trace or impression, a boundary, a sign or symbol, a tract of land held in common in a community--among others.) She chooses to have her making a mark bounded by two marks to whom this book is dedicated, her father, her son.  Perhaps the       <i>secret       </i> history of the dividing line is its situational quality, a boundary explored between groups whose differences seem marked, but whose fusions and mutual yearnings the poetry seems to enact: tribe to tribe, generation to generation (adult to child, father to daughter), male to female.  Sometimes, as in       <i>The Liberties       </i> there is a mental violence done to the women and the children--in that work, to Stella and Cordelia.  In       <i>The Liberties ,       </i> the two women, knowing they are defined by the plots of violence and nakedness and murder, still sometimes establish a tremendous, almost religious peace--the peace of the manifold workings of language.</font></div><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">Similarly, with &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (Part I of  <i>Pythagorean Silence) </i> the reader receives simultaneously the historical reference of violence and disaster and an imagistic sense of billowy, nacreous, sheltering space and sound.  Here, too, one has the luminous vulnerability of the emotional terrain: a He and She whose perspectives differ as vastly as do judgment from mourning. The poet replays shadowy scenes, for &quot;Only / what never stops hurting remains / in memory.&quot; She tries (in a maneuver reminiscent of many quest plots of many women writers) to come to terms with a &quot;pure and severe&quot; and absent male quester, later seen as &quot;Possession my father,&quot; and a time when &quot;midday or morrow / move motherless&quot; (i.e. &quot;Poverty my mother&quot;). This is done in the plangent voice of the child, daughter or soul, working into voice until &quot;biography blows away&quot; and she has simply distilled the pure essence of some story (say: quest, knife, ivy; the hunt, the dream, the shadow, the spindle), further refined to nouns of identity and mystery, for word picture-lists or word squares conclude a number of these books.</font><p ALIGN="CENTER"> ° </p><div align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">I like to take my gender questions subtle, intricate, formal. In narrative--point of view, telos, meaningful sequence. In language often the nature and level of resistance to smoothness and &quot;normalcy&quot; of poetry: the deformations in (un)grammatical, in (non)word &quot;play,&quot; in (mis)spellings, in investigation even unto the syllable, unto and into the letter, the mark. And in form--line breaks, page canvas, the use of space/silence/silencing/ the piercing of whiteness. Back and forth to move over the boundary line separating language from sheer vocable, sheer babble (which we women have as part of our materials: in baby talk, in the pleasurable, unreferential face-off that nonetheless makes one of the most important Meanings). Susan, Susan, you have grasped hold of this medium in its fullness. You open poetry formally, in sound; physically, on the page; emotionally, in the fearsome heart of story. All of the luminous greeny white sap-filled core of the lyric. </font></div><p ALIGN="CENTER"> ° </p><div align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">The play on the basic myth of the hero, the father--something from which the searching daughter feels alien, something for which the searching daughter feels desire.
