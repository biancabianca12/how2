It continued radical modernism. It was a space of positive resistance to and powerful critique of the period style in poetry, making a formal and intellectual critique which did feminist cultural work. It was a space for heterglossias, for conflictual discourses. It was a space for radical eagerness, for swift shifts, for coupure and splicing. It was a place in which one felt comfortable, buoyant, testing many genres (ode, pensée, essay) and many arts (sounds, as if music; visual fields, as if collage). It was a space for a sisterhood of exploration. I am grateful to have had it--grateful most especially to the generosity, brilliance, and labor of Kathleen Fraser, its founder and editor. I see the fruits of its experiment in many places now. But still, I am sorry that its time is up.</p>  <p align="justify"><i><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--Rachel Blau DuPlessis</i></p>  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center"><b>continuous, indefinable          </b>         <br>        <img src="0.gif" hspace="120" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">        <br>        <img src="0.gif" hspace="120" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">         </p>  <p>  <p align="justify">In the beginning we were writing and we were &quot;the unwritten.&quot; In that sense, nothing has changed.

Unpredictable by definition, &quot;the new&quot; seemed to have become quickly over-prescriptive in journals shaped by various male-dominant poetics or a feminist editorship whose tastes/politics did not acknowledge much of the poetry we felt to be central to our moment--the continuously indefinable, often &quot;peculiar&quot; writings being pieced together by women refusing the acceptable norms. We wanted to make a place for these writers. But we weren't fond of the grip of rules nor the territorial claims of the male manifesto tradition. We had no collective program, except the love of being surprised; our choices came out of individual enthusiasms and serious dialogue. We were interested in how works were freshly constructed and language reanimated within the experience of &quot;female&quot;-gendered lives.</p>  <p align="center">&#149;</p>  <p align="justify">&quot;we hear the masculine other with anxious ears what's dangerous is he doesn't hear us,&quot; Gail Scott wrote in 1985. We found our courage--and our family--by re-examining the innovative texts and role models of the known <i> and      </i> barely-known modernist women writers we'd largely been denied in our traditional educations. Our project, <i> HOW(ever),    </i> was built on that ground. We began to hear ourselves. Then others listened.
