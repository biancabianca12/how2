Howe showed slides of Dickinson's handwritten manuscripts (the actual lineation on the pages collected in the fascicles) and introduced the question of intentionality, from the poet's point-of-view, discussing not only the radically different choice of line break in the originals (as opposed to the cleaned-up versions) but also the visual intentionality of Dickinson's spaces, marks, crosses, dashes, etc. Because we feel that these issues continue to be relevant for modernist scholarship and current poetic practice among innovative women writers, we present an excerpted version of this talk, and have also included several remarks from another of Howe's lectures delivered at New College, San Francisco and recently published in     <i> Ironwood     </i>  #28, Vol. 14, No. 2.*)</p>  <p>An idea of the author Emily Dickinson--her symbolic value and aesthetic function--has been shaped by <i> The Poems of Emily Dickinson, including variant readings critically compared with all known manuscripts,        </i> edited by Thomas H. Johnson, and first published by the Belknap Press of Harvard University, in 1955. For a long time I believed that this editor had given us the poems as they looked. Thirty-one years later, <i> The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson,</i>        edited by Ralph Franklin, and again published by the Belknap Press of Harvard University, Cambridge, and London, show me that in a system of restricted exchange, the subject-creator and her art in its potential gesture, were domesticated and occluded by an assumptive privileged Imperative.</p></div><p class="style2"><img src="0.gif" hspace="100" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">&#149;<p class="style2"><div align="justify" class="style2">  <p>Thomas H.

By choosing a sovereign system for her line endings-- <i>his      </i> pre-appointed Plan, he established the constraints of a strained positivity.
