The voice on the other end identified itself as &quot;an entity.&quot; After giving me a sort of grade card report of my abilities, the voice became garbled with static and a many-tongued incoherency--some part of the message was missing. </p><p align="justify"><img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Simultaneously, Meredith Stricker had sent me some notes on her research into the Eleusinian mysteries; [&quot;. . . then they entered the sacred precinct and the doors of the Telesterion. . . &quot;](1) and [&quot;the initiated must not be informed, but they must receive impressions, and they must be put into a certain attitude of mind, provided it be evident they be prepared for it.&quot;] (2) Along with these notes were drawings she had made of what she described as an &quot;Orpheus Box.&quot; Here she was sending ideas for boxes on a stage. (The boxes were detailed as &quot;old televisions with mirrors in them and objects such as cones and drawings. . . .&quot;). The term &quot;T.V. obsession&quot; was written on the corner of these sketches. </p><p align="justify"><img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Acknowledging this powerful X-ing over between us, we began to track down and focus on the narrative cohering in our lives and set the structure for the performance. </p><p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="images/Vol5No2Img2.gif" HEIGHT="249" WIDTH="291"><br><img SRC="images/Vol5No2Img3.gif" HEIGHT="278" WIDTH="290"><br><img SRC="images/Vol5No2Img4.gif" HEIGHT="203" WIDTH="262"></p><p align="justify"><br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">The movement idea was to create a very singular intimacy--the kind of thought-feeling process which can manifest in any living room where one is alone with a &quot;turned-on t.v.&quot; We were dealing with inexplicable atom exchange (static) and translating that signal into a flesh and blood, skin and bone realism, using the body to call attention to and reduce the seductiveness of death. The premise that the television is a nonstop commercial for the safety of nuclear war, by &quot;proving&quot; that the world (body/image) can be taken apart (turned off) and put back together neatly, in less time than it takes to change channels, became the rhythm of the performance--the dialogue between &quot;increasing light&quot; and &quot;black out period.&quot; Again from Meredith's original notes: [&quot;. . . the fear of death was taken away by the mysteries. . . they affirmed, as did those of Orpheus, that our life is but a death and it is at the death of body that soul becomes free and is born.&quot;] (3) </p><p align="justify"><img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">In preparing these notes for <i> HOW(ever),      </i> I returned once more to the O.E.D., where I found in summary, Telesm Gr.
