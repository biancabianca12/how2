Now it haunts me as a series of tableaux weirdly prescient of another death, the death of my brother Joseph at the age of 24.<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">        <br>        <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">I think the tone of        <i> Linen Song        </i>  is relatively calm and stately; there is order, resolution, ritual, a natural progression of things. But death of the young is unnatural, it wrecks the equilibrium in a way that death of a parent does not.          <br>        <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Now, having been in the presence of death, I am bound to write more about the physicality of it, the way the body besieged disintegrates, makes itself a place where the soul cannot abide. I am forced to acknowledge the nature of death in a hospital, the way that doctors, nurses, priests, machines (and even, in the case of AIDS, the media) serve as a sort of chorus to the waning of life. Now writing about a death is an extension of the tossing and turning that one suffers at night, remembering a life supersaturated with meaning.    </p>  <hr>  <p align="left"><a HREF="lnlinen.html">go to the text</a></p>  <p align="left"><a HREF="1087.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a>        </p>  <hr>  <p align="center">    <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">      <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">      <param name="quality" value="high">      <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>    </object>  </p></td></tr></table></body></html><p><p><p><p><p><p>
