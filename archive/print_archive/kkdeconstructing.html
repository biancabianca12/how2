Official portraits rest on your knees--life-sized photographs of a seat- </nobr><br><nobr>ed woman bending sharply forward at the hips, inscribed with the words, &quot;Her innocence,  </nobr><br><nobr>her lightness, the DELICACY with which she suggests moods, her plasticity. . . .&quot;  </nobr><br><nobr>Flames lick up the leg of your chair. Jackhammers. AUTOMATIC FIRE. Blood pools on the linoleum  </nobr><br><nobr>and speckles the lens. The cigarette burning down in the ashtray is of very high quality  </nobr><br><nobr>and one of the GREATEST JOYS of your life. Someone is moving around in the next room,  </nobr><br><nobr>coughing, eating with his hands, wearing a white sweater, turning cartwheels. You watch  </nobr><br><nobr>with your EYES CLOSED. Each frame radiates ANXIETY AND LOVE. You adore the tears  </nobr><br><nobr>glistening in his eyes. Noises drift up from the street far below. FREEZE FRAME: A distant  </nobr><br><nobr>man carrying off your throne. You see yourself suddenly neutral with regard to the coro- </nobr><br><nobr>nation regalia, closer to the contemporary philosophy of PROJECTION. Your right hand is on  </nobr><br><nobr>your thigh, and you fondle with your left hand an agitated little dog which has its own  </nobr><br><nobr>JEWELED COLLAR. The merciless distance that comes with exile is the <i> real</i>  opulence that  </nobr><br><nobr>situates you in the world, the <i> real</i>  helter-skelter of your existence: PEOPLE, TRAIN STATIONS,  </nobr><br><nobr>HORSES, TREES, ROADS, HOUSES, CASTLES---an endless number of unfathomable forking  </nobr><br><nobr>paths. Where the throne-thief turns toward a subjective phenomenology, you keep a critical  </nobr><br><nobr>focus based in the smell of FACE POWDER, COFFEE, AND CREAM CAKES---a voluptuously  </nobr><br><nobr>entropic montage of semi-autobiographical details and not-exactly-painful but never- </nobr><br><nobr>theless inexplicable point-of-view shots, the plot spinning off mini-narratives and  <i>non sequiturs. </i>  </nobr><br><nobr>Behind you, a moment later, the KING appears. He wears a black leather jacket and aviator  </nobr><br><nobr>glasses. No Rollses, no Bentleys, no sirens, no flags. You are SOAKED IN SWEAT. You get up,  </nobr><br><nobr>go over to the window and close it. Still, a dream in which the longings of your senses are  </nobr><br><nobr>impossibly fulfilled persists. You turn on the faucet in the TINY WASHBASIN, you pass a  </nobr><br><nobr>DAMP WASHCLOTH over your forehead, the back of your neck, your shoulders. You are  </nobr><br><nobr>beset by seizures, unremitting pain, and involuntary wailing. INTENSE FALL OF LIGHT onto  </nobr><br><nobr>your right breast and into the whitened pages of the book you have put aside. You flash a T- </nobr><br><nobr>sign: TIME OUT. Later, people come because you are beautiful--a grand opera of silence  </nobr><br><nobr>and maternity--and are then AWED BY YOUR DISCONTINUITY. It's not a premeditated  </nobr><br><nobr>action, or rather it's not an action at all, but an absence of action, an action you do not per- </nobr><br><nobr>form. Dressed in pink jeans and a pink T-shirt, you appear CATATONIC on the ladderback  </nobr><br><nobr>brought in to replace the throne. You are accused of having had plastic surgery on your  </nobr><br><nobr>face. Rumors of some sort of ANNUNCIATION, the message unclear. Of a creature with 140  </nobr><br><nobr>pairs of wings. Taxi drivers and shopkeepers kiss your feet and grovel amiably. You slide  </nobr><br><nobr>toward an uncanny realization of your own ALIEN NATURE, a confusingly kinesthetic mon- </nobr><br><nobr>tage: day after day you walk; with bowed head you walk; you walk; you achieve nothing;  </nobr><br><nobr>you stop, move on, move on; you have lost all sense of direction. The associate curator  </nobr><br><nobr>DEFINES you as &quot;a devious architecture, a slippery architecture that SLIDES UNCONTROL- </nobr><br><nobr>LABLY from the familiar into the unfamiliar.&quot; Bickering ensues. As object of lectures four  </nobr><br><nobr>times a week, you are COMPOSED OF MANY MEANINGS. As a building you're beautiful,  </nobr><br><nobr>which aggravates the more modern faction. You are force-fed bullock's meat, butter and a  </nobr><br><nobr>drink of sugared water, sake and tapioca blended together and sprinkled with SWEET VINE- </nobr><br><nobr>GAR. Debates about the relative merits of fat versus thin icons rage, moderators gesturing  </nobr><br><nobr>like referees. YOU WALK ON, keeping close to the river; you stop and examine your feet;  </nobr><br><nobr>you set off again; stop; turn your back on the river. Now you have made your choice. You  </nobr><br><nobr>are really going home. You are mistaken. Your memory is slowly penetrated by oblivion.</nobr></td></tr></table><p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="images/Vol6No4Img3.gif" HEIGHT="264" WIDTH="206"></p><hr> <p align="left">Karen Kelley </p> <hr> <p align="left"><a HREF="kknotes.html">read the author's Bio and Working Notes</a></p> <p align="left"><a HREF="0192.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a>  </p> <hr> <p align="center">   <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">     <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">     <param name="quality" value="high">     <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>   </object> </p></td></tr></table></body></html>
