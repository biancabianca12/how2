I was fascinated about her whole process of playing a role, or I should say, living a role, the whole idea of being observer and observed at the same time. But I had alot of problems with Antin at the same time--I kept finding her petty and self-indulgent in her shifting moods and insecurities about being an artist in the world--but even that, I had mixed feelings about, ranging from being threatened because alot of it was too close to home, to feeling a sense of gratitude at seeing that I'm not the only one in the world to experience such things. I found her honesty repulsive, admirable and suspect all at the same time. When I finished the book I reread your review of the book, which helped me to resolve some of my feelings, especially your ideas on the journal being a performance itself, Antin's portrayal of multiple identities, and the way she was portraying an illusion and a reality at the same time. That last idea is very important to me right now since I've been using alot of fantasy in my own writing, projecting my &quot;heroine&quot; into various horror films, feeling that through that device I can get closer to what I'm trying to get across than if I approached it more directly.</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">Thank you for pointing out the book.

I side here with the seeming coldness and aloofness of Georgia O'Keeffe . . . .</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">There is, there is always, a new sentence, a new voice, a new timing that needs to be found, and it may come out of a female experience  <i>but must be transformed into something else, </i> larger, to move from construct into art and from report into rite. Great poetry is always, to me, about more than one thing, and so I gather that the dividing of appropriate texts into gender is necessary, central  <i>and </i> ephemeral . . . .</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">My first literary experiences into eros occurred reading Jill Johnston's column in  <i>The Village Voice,</i> ostensibly articles of dance critique but more and more, better and better, about her &quot;coming out.&quot; From this I deduce how important it is to have one's own sexual imaginings, one's own environment, mirrored in art: obviously, we all need approval, confirmation and communion . . . . A woman has to be fully present before she can write.</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">The mistake, I think, many women make in this process, is to confuse subject matter with state of being. Naturally a subject is important, but only as a guide to some other moral map. . .  there's a time and perhaps the time is now, when feminism blocks transcendence  <i>(not </i> to another world, but  <i>in this one) </i> and is another crutch. I myself am working towards a voice  <i>with </i> character, not  <i>of </i> character.</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"> <b>---</b> Jane Miller</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"></font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"><div align="justify">(Jane Miller's collections of poems include     <i>The Greater Leisures,     </i> Doubleday, 1983, and     <i>many junipers, heartbeats,     </i> Copper Beach Press, 1980.)</div><hr><p><a HREF="0285.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a></p><hr><p align="center">  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
