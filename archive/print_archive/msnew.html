A shifting of smoke-colored branches at dusk. The more I read H.D., the more I feel loosened from categories--in the woods watching deer take on the color of underbrush. As a reader I'm increasingly unsure of the species I'm encountering. Essay or lyric? Novel or film script? Is this an animate animal/bush or some kind of leafy tree/deer I'm tracking? </p><p>   One of H.D.'s many names: <i> dryad</i> --hybrid  of tree and woman--prefigures the kind of image she will write.Not vegetable, animal <i> or</i>  mineral as common sense &amp; cultural norms would dictate. Instead she chooses to define by undermining category toward exactitude. <p> As though H.D.'s images are gained through the application of a new kind of science: a rigorous in-seeing that radically alters our reading of what is given as natural by destabilizing and crossing normative boundaries.  <p>  &quot;Science and art must beget a new creative medium,&quot; H.D. writes in <i> The Gift.*</i>  Her work projects a scientific mythos where trees can be women--hamadryads, enspirited vegetation. And a mountain is also a maiden: an oread. <p> &quot;Oread&quot; is usually cited as an exemplar of Imagism. I'm interested, however, in re-examining the poem as a series of strategies for image-making that radically counters imagist practice. <p><font FACE="Palatino">  <p><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> <img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Oread<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Whirl up, sea<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">whirl your pointed pines,<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">splash your great pines<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">on our rocks,<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">hurl your green over us,<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">cover us with your pools of fir.<img src="0.gif" hspace="46" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">(CP 55)<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> <p>The overlapping of sea and forest engenders images of a new species--the sea/fir or trees that move like waves where pines or lines are splashed, whirled open to a new world where the green--the newly seen--washes over us as we read. <p><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> <img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Whirl<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">whirl<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">your<img src="0.gif" hspace="12" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">pines<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="22" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">your<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">pines<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="10" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">your<img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">us<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="14" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">us<img src="0.gif" hspace="10" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">your<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> <p>These mirrored words compose ideogrammatic clusters apprehended as forms in themselves--as though we could read without even knowing English.

The poem reverberates semantic associations that allow us to hear <i> ghost rhymes</i>--lines for pines, seen for green.<p>We cross borders between sound &amp; semantics--to merge the categories of forest &amp; sea. The process is erotic: it creates affinity and binding at the inner roots of language. <p> Instead of the clicking shut of Frost's well-oiled lock, H.D. presents us with multi-layered sounds--the aural equivalent to palimpsest. It would be a mistake to think of H.D.'s image as only visual. Imagine a structure for voice to enter. The image for H.D. is a honeycomb to attract rhythm &amp; sound the way a reed or a whistle draws breath into music. Or like the rattling of a prayer wheel in the wind. The image is also a <i> madrigal:</i>  song for five or six voices; lyric poem set to music--from <i> matigale, matricale--matrix</i>--of the womb. Image, then, as visual matrix made of sound.<p>Repetition &amp; rhyme in H.D.'s work teach us the limits of sense--of what makes sense through the old categories. We have to read with all our senses, not just sense alone. To read &quot;Oread&quot; for sense only leaves us with &quot;whirl&quot;--twice--a crystalline image, rock-hard, locked shut. When we read with all our senses, sound leads us--opens the lines--(or the pines)--so that whirl is also <i> whorl</i>  (both carry the phonetic equivalent of wûrl). <p> A whorl in water as leaved pattern: plant/wave or sea/garden and also H.D.'s fingerprint or mark. &quot;Oread&quot; hybridizes a moving leaf/fingerprint/flower/shell.<br><p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="images/Vol5No4Img6.gif" HEIGHT="174" WIDTH="119"></p><p><font FACE="Palatino"><p>For me it seems clear that H.D.'s &quot;whorl&quot; <i> prefigures</i>  Pound's &quot;vortex--radiant node or cluster . . . from which and into which ideas are rushing. . . .&quot; <p> &quot;Oread&quot; enacts a linguistic vortex at the primary units of the poem. The &quot;rushing&quot; in and out--the sea wash--occurs through a fundamental semantic ambiguity. Verbs exchange places with nouns. The written is compounded with the spoken. Homonyms &amp; homophones act as mirrors, destabilizing the bedrock of grammar. <p> The title itself suggests a borderline species of noun which also shifts to the imperative--O read--instructing us how to enter the poem as a mirror for the reading process itself--one that is constructed by the reader's willingness to keep the image in motion. Reflecting: &quot;to throw or bend back (heat, light or sound).&quot;<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br>  <img src="0.gif" hspace="100" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> <i>--Meredith Stricker</i> <br><img src="0.gif" hspace="250" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br>[ A longer version of this essay appeared in <i> Ink,</i>  No.3.
