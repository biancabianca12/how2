After saying she particularly liked my poem &quot;Notes From a Suicide Not Committed,&quot;*which she found to be &quot;original and unsettling,&quot; she continued: &quot;One visual aspect of 'Notes' that seemed to give readers difficulty was the use of slashes, especially at the beginning of the poem. I am, of course, telling you this for your information, not to encourage you to 'fix it.' &quot;</div><p align="justify">   <div align="justify">The poem had been worked on over a period of time; the slashes persisted, they seemed important to me. I intuitively felt that they drew the reader's attention to the interconnectedness of the words in the line as well as to the ways in which they were not related. I wanted to draw the reader to    <i> this    </i>  word or set of words in this way. I considered putting words on another line thinking maybe this would create the same effect I was after, but it didn't work. The words I had on a line belonged together / but / they didn't. / The poem is about disconnection--how we are always defining our terms--and it's about death, the wanting it and not.</div><p align="justify">   <div align="justify">The beginning of the poem begins with flies</div><p><font FACE="Palatino"><div align="left"><br>  gathering outside the door. / Some stillness    <br>    in the air/has made them come to where their wings/sound/    <br>    like the word:    <i> jump, jump, jump.    </i>  / I move my hands through    <br>    my hair. There is safety in touch. /    <br>    <br>    These notes are for you./<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">And you. / Like the flies. /    <br>    They wait /outside/a door./<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">What I see/through    <br></div><div align="justify">  <p>Slashes after the first stanza wanted to show a sense of closure in the thought as well as a sense of irony--the urge to die (jump) and the longing to touch something actual. In the second line of the second stanza, I wanted the tension between &quot;outside&quot; and &quot;a door.&quot; The slashes, I hoped, would suggest the meditative process of my thinking. </p>  </div><div align="justify">In other places in the poem, I wanted to take apart language, everyday phrases, see the humor of a different context.</div><p><div align="left">  <p>What then? Do we always        <br>    leave the garden behind?      <br>    Our father who/art/      <br>    Amen      <br>    if I die      <br>    before      <br>    Amen      <br>    Thank you      <br>    Thank you      <br>    Thank/you/</p>  <p align="justify"> Slashes are rarely used in the main body of this long poem. They reappear at the conclusion of the poem when a series of words or phrases used elsewhere comes together. The slashes reframe words used in other locations, stressing the new (re-newed) meaning in this context, that the way we examine our relationship to language is cumulative, that we need to wonder what we mean. I wanted a staccato, breathless effect.</p></div><p><div align="left">  <p><img src="0.gif" hspace="112" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">I try        <br>    to say aging is interesting and find myself      <br>    saying This isn't me, this isn't me/on a window/      <br>    tethered/hung/perched/jumping/falling/up      <br>    the sleeve/in the hat/out the door/rolling      <br>    down a hill/</p>  <p align="justify">I ended with a splash, I suspect, because I wanted to end with a sense of going on in this continual interruption called &quot;my life,&quot; this life being separate from what we know, what we are moving toward. </p></div><div align="left"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--Paula Gocker, Oakland, CA  </div><hr><p align="justify"><a NAME="gbpost"></a>With recent world events, I have known, again, the value of the poets. In the last few weeks, the official state language has been particularly corrupt: words no longer mean anything when . . . a swap is not a swap, a summit is not a summit and then is again a summit, failure is success, de-link is presented as a real verb and--most important--mis-information is revealed as a conscious strategy . . . . Poetry is valuable because it forces what is always in danger of being lost: a close attention to language . . . . One of the discoveries of      <i> Trilogy      </i> is that &quot;The fight for life, for breath&quot; and &quot;scribblings&quot; are intertwined: not only is the connection between poetry and community, art and life, <i> real,      </i>  it is      <i> necessary.      </i> </p><p><font FACE="Palatino"><p><div align="left"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--Gloria Bowles, excerpted from her talk &quot;Community and Poetry: The Feminist Vision&quot; delivered at the <i> Emily Dickinson, H.D.
