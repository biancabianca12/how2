Nor does this poem move through a landscape, shedding perceptions as it goes. These negatively-arrived-at determinations of formal limits put in place in advance enabled me to cope with the subject of travel without succumbing to the picaresque givens of the travelogue. Positively speaking, I chose to populate the poem with types--a vintner, a tourist, a concierge--and work with this readymade cast of characters throughout, closing the poem with a muted reprise of these characters, together with associated <i> leitmotifs.      </i> I further chose to alternate essay with lyric in the hope that this intertextual tactic would add to the destabilization of &quot;feeling foreign,&quot; the ultimate theme of the poem. <br>      <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Precisely because &quot;Institutions To Be Left Obscure&quot; had its origins in a phrase about preferring problems to solutions, and because I thought it best to develop the poem stressing this, the theme of death appears as a problem, stated and restated (and restated again) before an enigma presented as a solution to this insoluble problem arises. </p>  <hr>  <p align="left">go to  <a HREF="mwway.html">A Way of Life </a>   or  <a HREF="mwinstitutions.html">Institutions To Be Left Obscure </a></p>  <p align="left">   <a HREF="1089.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a>        </p>  <hr>  <p align="center">    <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">      <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">      <param name="quality" value="high">      <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>    </object>  </p></td></tr></table></body></html><p><p><p><p><p><p>
