It was this negligence of the brilliant and original writings of figures such as Lorine Niedecker, Mina Loy, and Jane Bowles--denying us access to an on-going tradition of female innovation in poetry and prose--that prompted the making of this journal. By 1983, Stein, Woolf, H.D., and Moore were finally being seriously reconsidered by feminist scholars, yet the reality and necessity of the innovative perspective--being actively practiced by contemporary women poets--was seriously eroded and undermined by disregard. If there was hostility or simply wary bafflement among scholars and critics, we have hoped to engage productively with that resistance by asking our contributing poets to write &quot;Working Notes&quot; for their texts--brief descriptions of the project's germination and how that was translated into its formal making. We've also believed that by asking women poets (as well as scholars) to write about the works of other women, certain of the puzzling pieces might fall into place or, at the least, alert an active curiosity. </p><div align="center">  <p>&#149;    </p>  </div><div align="justify">Recent or up-coming publications to note:    <i> The Crystal Cabinet, My Childhood at Salterns,     </i> by Mary Butts.
