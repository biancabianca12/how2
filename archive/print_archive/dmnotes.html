In 1981, she and her son, Kit, visited England to reacquaint themselves with her mother's roots--in family and language.         <i>How Hug a Stone         </i> (excerpted here), which chronicles this journey, was recently published by Turnstone Press (201-99 King St., Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). Among Marlatt's books are         <i>What Matters,         </i> poems &amp; journal entries; <i>Zocalo,           </i> a nonfiction novel; and         <i>Steveston,         </i> a historical drama aired on CBC.         <i>Touch to My Tongue         </i> will be out this year from Longspoon Press. Marlatt helped to organize the Canadian literary conference &quot;Women and Words / Les femmes et les mots&quot; at the University of British Columbia last year.</font></p>  <p align="left"><b><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">WORKING NOTES FROM DAPHNE MARLATT:</b> </p>  <p align="justify">This book was written in a series of layers, almost archeological the urge to    dig deeper in, to the hidden [not yet verbalized] series of connections    that underlay, like root systems, like bone-seeds, the obvious data of our trip.    Writing/traveling a series of intersections, two kinds of speech as my Canadian    tongue found its way around the remnants of my British one. Traveling as a gathering    of bones [to bring back to life, joined, in the body of the text]. My journal was full of    jottings as well as narrative paragraphs and these informed the journal entries in the    book. First came the poems which started as soon as I got home, dense clusters of  intersections. Then came the prose entries, as narrative connecting lines. Text as        <i>map,</i> another kind of body--not &quot;napkin, sheet&quot;, shroud, not a mere imprint of    experience long gone, but speech speaking what is to be said. </p>  <hr>  <p><a HREF="dmhow.html">go to the text</a></p>  <p><a HREF="0284.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a>    </p>  <hr>  <p align="center">    <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">      <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">      <param name="quality" value="high">      <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>    </object>  </p></td></tr></table></body></html><p><p><p><p><p><p>
