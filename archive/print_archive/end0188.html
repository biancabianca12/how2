It is with this sense of a female tradition of &quot;making our own,&quot; provided by the modernist women poets, that we salute Marianne Moore in this issue. Recent arrivals: <i> Heroine,</i>  a novel, by Gail Scott, Coach House Press, Toronto; <i> The Mexican Murals,</i>  poems and essays, Cynthia Kraman, e.g. Press, San Francisco; <i> Japan,</i>  poems, by Maxine Chernoff, Avenue B, Bolinas; <i> W.C.</i>  <i>Fields in Frenchlight,</i>  poems by Rochelle Owen, Contact II Publications, New York; <i> Notes preceding trust,</i>  poems and prose, by Kathleen Fraser, The Lapis Press, Santa Monica; recent poet/artist interviews, in chapbook form, from the <i> Bench Press Series on Art,</i>  edited by Madeleine Keller (141 W. 24th St., New York, NY 10011) . . . the first, combining interviews with Bernadette Mayer (including a discussion of her writing of <i> Utopia,</i>  as well as her own thoughts on language, style and process) and the NY painter, Lois Dodd; the second, a double interview and conversation between the fiction writer/critic, Carol Ascher, and the poet/critic, Rachel Blau DuPlessis. Correction and apology to Susan Roberts, whose bio note in <i> H(er)</i>  IV, No. 2, mistakenly listed her forthcoming chapbook as <i> Cherries in the Snow.</i>  The correct title is <i> Cherries in the Afternoon,</i>  and will be published by Abacus (Potes and Poets Press).<p align="justify">  The next issue of <i> HOW(ever)</i>  will be looking at connections between the language of film and women poets working out of that vocabulary. Postcards should be sent to Susan Gevirtz, 578 Precita, San Francisco, CA 94110. Manuscript reading for future issues will come to a halt temporarily, due to the abundance of work received, but will resume again in September, 1988.
