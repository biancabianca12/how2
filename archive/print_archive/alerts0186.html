She's so authentic that sincerity is irrelevant; after all you can say what you mean and be sincere without knowing who you are but she knows who she is, a grown-up genius. </div> <p align="justify">   <div align="justify">She tells us the opposite of what they told us in high school--personality     <i> doesn't     </i>  count. What counts is emptiness, an empty readiness. To write well is to write out of     <i> entity,   </i> not out of identity. Identity is what you use to cash a check, she says. As entity we exist in a way that has nothing to do with remembering, nothing to do with an audience, with an &quot;I&quot; that is composed of the eyes upon us. The effort of insisting on ourselves as personality distracts from the necessary minimal functions of the mind, she says, smiling her Buddha smile. </div> <p align="justify">   <div align="justify">We learn more about Stein through her essays than through biography. Biography is identity, a finished thing, probably a lie. The real self emerges out of conversations about tools and consciousness. Stein's tools are beveled but high gauge, and her observations of language have the arbitrariness that comes from genuine intimacy. For instance: interjections have nothing to do with anything, not even themselves; commas are servile; and the question-mark is OK as a brand for cattle but not much else. Her tastes are clear, and what she finds indigestible she rejects as poetics. Grammar is inside us, like heart, liver, blood. Grammar is a physical matrix that determines what we can say and therefore what we can do. Compare Monique Wittig   in     <i> Les Guerrilères: </i> &quot;The language you speak is made up of words that are killing you.&quot; </div> <p align="justify">   <div align="justify">Stein does not use inflated or overinherited language. She chooses good simple words insistently, as if she is always at the beginning again, her complexity growing out of her insistent simplicity. Her words. Force. Us. To. Read. Them. Every. Word. For. Word. Forward, without skipping, for reading is a physiological act set in the continuous present; we must not pretend that the present is the future. </div> <p align="justify">   <div align="justify">Stein slows us down. She knows how not to name things but to encircle them. Beginning again and again (before names, before the laws of names) becomes a natural thing, and tentativeness builds ineluctably to confidence. We read her slowly or again and by the time we understand what she means we have been composed. And finally it is not only the repetition but the equanimity of the repetition that composes us. Does her tone of equanimity combined with her radical forms present a paradox? No. Yes. To play upon her remark about Alice B. Toklas in the<i> Autobiography,    </i>Stein has a radical point of view but she likes to sit with her back to it. </div> <p align="justify">  <div align="justify"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10"> --Lynn Luria-Sukenick </div> <p><font FACE="Palatino"><font FACE=" Palatino"> <i></i>  <p> <div align="left"><i>(Gertrude Stein: Writings and Lectures 1909-1945.   </i>  Edited by Patricia Meyerowitz.

Critics have retrieved her for female modernism, for the female aesthetic, for the avant-garde, for American experimentalism, for lesbian writing, for theoretical study of gender and culture, for the literary matrilineal descent (if we are women writers we think back through our mothers, says WooIf in    <i> A Room of One's Own).     </i> And we will soon make her presence more substantial by writing about the profoundly important female experimental writing in the less accessible Stein--published in eight volumes of the Yale Edition, of which Richard Kostelanetz's selection can give only a sketchy idea. </div><p align="justify"> <div align="justify">Stein is useful not only to critics but to writers who are now trying to resist precisely the same structures of mind/culture/language as she did then. Stein's reinvention of the sentence does not depend on her own voice, content, palette, referential universe for its literary efficacy. Any of us can adapt her &quot;semi-grammaticalness,&quot; her disruptions of the sentence which abrogate but do not demolish syntactical convention. These disruptions are precisely the model so many women writers want for scrambling but not scrapping the text we are trying to rewrite--for doing what she did, retaining the skeleton of the sentence but giving it entirely new flesh.

It doesn't make itself either through &quot;voice&quot; or Profundity, as do Joyce's, Beckett's, even Woolf's writings. If we use any of them as models, we can only &quot;sound like&quot; them, imitate them, echo or shadow a subjectivity which itself is part of what we're trying to rewrite. Stein gives us a real blueprint, a deep <i> structure  </i>  of resistance to prevailing materials of mind/culture/ language because, in spite of everything (all attempts to change the weather), it is still patriarchal late capitalism outside, years after Stein's achievement. </p><p align="justify"><div align="justify">Eminently usable anti-patriarchal literary structures such as Stein's need not be the sole property of women writers. As Julia Kristeva suggests in    <i> About Chinese Women,    </i>  whoever chooses to use them puts her--or himself in the cultural position of woman: the margin, the only place from which we can begin to dismantle all structures of center and margin. But if that is the case, where now in praxis is the difference in literary daughterhood? </div><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"><font FACE=" Palatino"><div align="justify"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--Marianne DeKoven </div><p align="justify"><div align="justify">Lynn Luria-Sukenick's most recent book of poems is    <i> Houdini Houdini,    </i>  Cleveland State University Poetry Center, 1982.
