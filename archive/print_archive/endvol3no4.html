Noting the insistence of tradition--the stanzaic corsetting of Emily Dickinson's wayward lineation by her well-meaning editors--we are reminded that such assumptive judgments still dominate editorial practice. In this issue, we are looking at the way hierarchies of power get reproduced in daily experience. Re-thinking Dickinson's intentionality, at odds with the poetic blueprint of her age, we can reflect on our own freedom to re-invent the poem's way . . . locating something fugitive and claiming it. Resistance surely flexes itself linguistically.  </p>  <p><img src="0.gif" hspace="100" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">&#149;<p><div align="justify">Toward this project, the new English-Canadian newsletter of feminist innovative writing,    <i> (f.)Lip,    </i>  Editors: Betsy Warland, Sandy (Frances) Duncan.
