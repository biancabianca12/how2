Prose is the balance the emotional balance that makes the reality of paragraphs and the unemotional balance that makes the reality of sentences and having realized completely realized that sentences are not emotional while paragraphs are, prose can be the essential balance that is made inside something that combines the sentence and the paragraph, examples of this I have been reading to you.&quot;<div align="left"><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="5" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> --Gertrude Stein, from &quot;Poetry and Grammar,&quot; <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="5" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> in  Lectures in America     <br></div><p><font FACE="Palatino"><p align="justify"><div align="justify">We do know now a little what paragraphs are. Curious to get to the roots of    <i> paragraph,    </i>  Contributing Editor Carolyn Burke came up with this definition from her dictionary, which says that the Greek    <i> paragraphos    </i> was a &quot;line to mark exchange in dialogue, from <i> paragraphein,    </i>  to write beside:    <i> para,    </i>  beside +    <i> graphein    </i> ,    <i></i> to write. &quot;It would be nice,&quot; suggests Carolyn, to think of the paragraphs in dialogue with each other, or the writing happening more beside-ways than sequentially.&quot;</div><p align="justify"><p align="justify"><img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Certainly Stein's discovery that it is the emotional balance that makes the reality of paragraphs--as distinct from the reality of the sentence--continues to be borne out in much of current writing practice. We do know now a little what paragraphs are, having received many from poets who require a different unit of thought and feeling to linguistically measure the thing being addressed (the moment under pressure). . . &quot;the essential balance that is made inside something,&quot; not adequately arrived at with the strategy of the line, the stanza or the sentence on its own.<br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="100" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">&#149; </p><p>Publications to note: Fanny Howe's <i> The Lives of a Spirit,        </i> released this summer by Sun &amp; Moon Press, Los Angeles; Gertrude Stein's <i> Geography &amp; Plays, </i> recently reprinted by Station Hill Press; the collection of essays, <i> The Female Body in Western Culture,        </i> ed.
