Illicit walls when one is so near crime, language collides, trembles at the edge of being revoked. It makes a sentence, in high heels invading the water, shrinking from history, the kind pressed into women's arms, strapped to repeat old reigns: &quot;she wanted to.&quot; Collapsing the habitual boundaries of literary genre, <i>L'Amant     </i> exists as     <i>ergasterion,    </i><sup>2</sup> privileged space of a textual body withdrawn from the sharp mirrors of nostalgia. Shockingly, Duras enters it as if a stranger in her own building, keys and door, preposterous liberties.

It would have to be an infraction, desire as regime, not a narrative frame but open campaign against absence, a girl under duress, her mother's life, a woman's silence. <p>  <table><tr><td><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><font FACE="Palatino"> </td></tr></table><table><tr><td><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><font FACE="Palatino">      <div align="left">She sings.

She goes directly to the subject here, she wastes no time. &quot;Now that religion has broken with what lay embedded in faith, the shivered emotion attaches again in crystals to objects.&quot; (Glenway Wescott) The body of the poem becomes filled with <i>things,   </i> with boxes, with screens, with feathers, with balls, with cups, the details of the personal highly charged and engaged, every correspondence the means to reverse what she called &quot;the translation from fact to reality,&quot; by which she surely meant the substitution of a daimonic and altogether more interesting double and triple existence for what the contemporary has allowed, this 'single-fold,' this fake. The intense personal of <i>her   </i> realism lay with the potency of the phrase, the Wood, the understood relation between Nature and Mystery, the power of ritual and evocation as both studied and unknown: the ground of the Sacred as Fearful. With Mary Butts the situation or description of event can be so altered by simple but intended movement that the very resonance of air so set in motion becomes the sympathetic bridge: all of her work makes present this faith and is inseparable from it. </div><p align="justify"> <p align="justify">  <font FACE="Palatino">   <div align="justify">Her neglect has been puzzling, and I'm sorely tempted to say something about her falling out of Fashion because Fashion has disallowed Soul, because Soul itself is such an unfashionable notion. Of all the writers published in the 1925     <i>Contact Collection of Contemporary Writers,     </i> the volume that includes Pound, Joyce, Dorothy Richardson, Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy, H.D., Stein and Williams, the name of Mary Butts stands out as singly unattended. And yet there is this: a reprint due this fall from Virago Press of     <i>The Crystal Cabinet,     </i> a    <i></i> quite wonderful and magical book of autobiography of her childhood in Dorset, finished shortly before her death; a reprint of     <i>Imaginary Letters,     </i> published in 1979    <i></i> by Talon Books; and the great dedication of the poet Kenneth Irby, who is preparing a major collection of her poetry as well as a bibliography of her published work.

Outside the front door, on the drive, after rain; when the new gravel had been put down and the gardeners had gone over it with a round thing that groaned. (My father said they were fools, because they would not think when to put on and take off the weights that were inside the thing: the thing called the garden-roller that would not move for one, however hard one tried. That memory comes later.) The mud in the shallow puddle was lovely, like something you could eat. It happened when the ivy on the porch and on the walls was smooth and glossy and shiny and dripped. You ought to be able to eat it--like cream or the yellow out of the paint-box; you ought to spoon it up. Perhaps something that wasn't food and looked as if it ought to be food would taste all right this time. Nurse was a few steps ahead. Perhaps if it wasn't sweet, it was like the yellow of egg. I had my best green coat on and a bonnet to match with fur round its edge that came off a beaver in the picture-book. Dark green. With the gravel it would look like egg and spinach. Pretending (not quite to myself) that it was a real tumble, I splashed full length, and for the quick second, close to the ground where I should not be allowed to stay, my nose in the smooth wet, I put out my tongue. No good, and not so soft. Gritty. So that was mudtaste, the lovely yellow mud that gravel makes.

By Barbara Wagstaff. </div> <p> <p><font FACE="Palatino"> <div align="justify">Mary Butts, great-granddaughter of Thomas Butts, William Blake's patron and friend, emerged during the modernist period as both poet and author of several volumes of short stories, historical novels and a novelistic trilogy. Born on December 13, 1890, in Dorsetshire, she died in mid-career in Cornwall in 1937. Her childhood home, Salterns in Dorsetshire, housed a fine Blake collection now at the Tate. This collection, as well as her father's library, formed the beginning reading that helped to generate her life as an artist. In Paris and London, where she went as a young woman, she met H.D., Bryher, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, T.S. Eliot, Jean Cocteau and Virgil Thompson, and was encouraged in her work by Ford Madox Ford and Ezra Pound. She contributed poems, essays, stories and reviews to many of the important literary journals of that time, among them      <i>Pagany, The Little Review, The Dial, Seed,      </i> and      <i>Transatlantic Review.      </i> Her first novel,      <i>Ashe of Rings,      </i> was published by Robert McAlmon's Contact Editions. Except for two novels reissued within the last decade, her works have been long unavailable. </div> <p align="justify">      <font FACE="Palatino"> <div align="justify">In Mary Butts's books, the real and surreal life of Paris and London in the twenties conjoins with the mythic realm of gods and Nature, immersing characters and readers in a Mystery where an intense magic, the vibrant rapport between things earthly and things heavenly and the possibilities arising from these bonds, holds sway. Detectives of correspondences, players in ancient dramas, her characters adventure in the domains of Greek and Celtic myth and legend. From her early acquaintance with Norse mythology, the Bible, the high romance of the Grail, Spenser, Milton and, above all, Shelley and the Romantics, as well as from a lifelong closeness to the woods, sea, moors and creatures of her native Dorset and Cornwall, Mary Butts gained an apprehension of a sacred presence. </div> <p align="justify">      A woman is often the major, though not the dominant figure in the increasingly communal story her characters' lives unfold; as female protagonist, she sets in motion the divine powers, rather than controlling the action. She is unconventional, defined neither by prescribed female roles  <i>or </i> career/cause. She is a life-bearer, an artist of love such as Shelley describes Keats, shaping more permanent, expansive relationships and a more inclusive community than the world will admit. While not saintly in the usual sense, this &quot;life-bearer&quot; resists the ill-will, envy and rivalry threatening to become a new morality and generates an atmosphere of sympathy where a crossing-over can occur, the Eternal reach into time where things happen differently than in the ordinary chain of events. &quot;Rings Hill,&quot; Butts writes, &quot;is a place of evocation. Where the word is made flesh. That's too poetical. I mean a place where the shapes we make with our imagination find a body.&quot; <p align="justify"> <i></i>  <p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"> <div align="justify"><i>--Barbara Wagstaff </i> </div> <p align="justify"> <i></i>  <p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"> <div align="justify">Barbara Wagstaff is a Mary Butts scholar, currently in England to do research on the fictional works of Mary Butts.
