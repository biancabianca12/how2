Between that year and 1983--when her life was taken in an act of random violence in New York City--Cha developed an extraordinary sensitivity to the struggle and meaning of acquiring language and attempting its transformative use in a culture which marked her--the speaker--as marginal. Cha's body of writing, performance work and video/film material is a particularly strong and poignant example of a woman artist's struggle to claim voice out of silence. After studying art, performance and film technique at UC Berkeley and at the Centre d'Etudes Américaine du Cinéma à Paris, Cha moved to New York to write and direct video and film performances and installations. She was an educator as well, teaching video theatre at Elizabeth Seaton College and sharing her artistic vision at Halifax School of Design in Nova Scotia in 1982. <i>HOW(ever)     </i> dedicates this issue to Theresa Cha's continuing presence in her words. The works on pages 1 through 4 are excerpted from Cha's book,      <i>Dictee,      </i> published by Tanam Press in 1983. An appreciation of this book and a Cha bibliography follow.</p>  <p>Excerpts from <i>Dictee     </i> will be included in the traveling exhibit &quot;Autobiography: In Her Own Image,&quot; a collection of multi-cultural art works by women to appear in Atlanta, Georgia, October 14 to November 12; Mills College Art Gallery, Oakland, California, January 29 to March 5; Ritter Gallery, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida, March 21 to April 28; and Women and Their Work Gallery, Austin, Texas, May 22 to June 26. </p></div><p><hr><p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="images/Vol5No1Img7.gif" HEIGHT="97" WIDTH="205"></p><font FACE=" Palatino"><div align="justify"><br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="130" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> <b>From A Far:    <i> Dictee    </i></b>      <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="130" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">    <br>    <a NAME="dictee"></a>From A Far--the arrival of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha from Korea to America, crossing ocean, crossing over, one tongue to another. The attenuation that is learning another tongue, space in which the fissure the fission in words do the work of memory. Inheritance up against time figured without measure. The difficulty of speaking, uttering a single sound, mired by the weight of history.    <br>    <br>    A generation of mothers forced to speak the language of the oppressor. Mothers who spoke Korean under their breaths knowing that death was the punishment for this act. As part of the attempt to subjugate a nation, the Japanese during a thirty-six year colonization of Korea, forbade Korean from classrooms, from marketplaces, from dinner tables. In    <i> Dictee,    </i>  Cha traces this and other sites of struggle in Korean history. In relating the work of Yu Guan Soon, a nineteen-year-old woman who led a resistance group against the Japanese in 1919, or in evoking her own family's history in the context of other political struggles in Korea, Cha is not paying homage to points fixed in time but rather, suggesting that history defies linearity: the figure of Yu Guan Soon juxtaposed with the figure of Joan of Arc--what happened, what continues to happen.    <br>    <br>    This notion of simultaneity is central to Cha's language practice in    <i> Dictee.    </i> Painstaking awareness of lip over lip, tongue against teeth, to produce even one utterance: the forging between word and word, word and punctuation, eroding even as it is being constructed. Similarly, Cha may &quot;spell out&quot; camera techniques--fade in, close up, extreme close up, so the image or a movement of thought is constituted by the labor of its parts and not the arrival at a whole. <i> Dictee    </i>  has allegiances to autobiography, narrative, lyric, but moves beyond each of these. Anatomical diagrams of the larynx are inserted; photographs represent a lineage of women (Yu Guan Soon, Cha's mother, a still of Joan of Arc from Carl Dreyer's    <i> La passion de Jeanne d'Arc);    </i>  Chinese calligraphy presences man, woman, mother, father; side-by-side presentations of French and English texts signal the intrusion/collusion inherent in traversing between two languages. Layering and erasure. Cha exposes minutiae, process, to dispel the idea that one seamless version of reality governs a text.    <i> Dictee    </i>  gives shape to the nearly unwritten, the nearly invisible, the hardly say(able).    <br>    <br>  &quot;. . .the arrangement that she was to be come his wife. . . Decided for her. Perhaps she learned to love him. . . She deserved so little. Being wife. . . Her non-body her non-entity.&quot; Gender as it specifies relationship to language. Disappearance, abnegation, constant postponement under the sign of wife (woman). &quot;She moves in pauses. She yields space and in her speech, the same. Hardly speaks. Hardly at all.&quot; Gender and race defining accessibility to language, empowerment. However full of &quot;pause,&quot; however full of &quot;void,&quot; the voice that emerges in <i> Dictee    </i> invokes &quot;the remnant is the whole.&quot;    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">     <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="110" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> <i>--Myung Mi Kim    </i>       <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="250" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="250" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="250" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">    <br>    <b>BIBLIOGRAPHY: THERESA HAK KYUNG CHA    </b>      <b>Publications:    </b> </div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><div align="left"><i>Etang,</i> Lane.    (Berkeley, 1979)<font FACE="Palatino"></div><div align="left">  <p><i>Apparatus,    </i> edited by Cha, Tanam Press.

Toklas.    </i> Donald Sutherland, for many years the only critic who understood her with love, says the book is told &quot;in a purer and more closely fitting prose. . . than even Gide or Hemingway have ever commanded. . . .&quot;Four years later Djuna Barnes published <i> Nightwood,    </i> with an introduction by T. S. Eliot, which included the remark, &quot;the great achievement of a style. . . .&quot; That year Jane Bowles wrote <i> Le Phaéton Hypocrite, </i>  a manuscript now lost. She was not to begin work on her novel,     <i> Two Serious Ladies,     </i>  until two years later. All three of these prose writers have in common a magical and luminous obsession with women. How this corresponds to critical acclaim, couched as it has been in terms of wit and surprise, moves and disturbs.       <br>     <br>     In particular the case of Jane Bowles is an interesting one. Bowles' style is indeed surprising and funny, and John Ashbery, for one, has read it right in declaring &quot;no other contemporary author can consistently produce surprise of this quality, the surprise that is the one essential ingredient of great art.&quot; Yet Bowles has had a difficult time achieving recognition. Physically, she certainly had a difficult life. Early on she lost the flexibility in one knee to tuberculosis; she suffered a stroke at the age of 40; she had great lapses in concentration and confidence all her writing life, but especially after the stroke. Her marriage to the composer and novelist Paul Bowles, and their incessant traveling to South America, North Africa, and Europe, reinforced Jane's near-manic emotional environment. And her fiery affairs and flirtations with women liberated and at the same time obsessed her. [ See Millicent Dillon's biography of Bowles, <i> A Little Original Sin,     </i> Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston (New York, 1981), reprinted by Virago (London, 1988).] <br>     <br>     The &quot;quirkiness&quot; of her work has much to do with the fact that to Jane Bowles &quot;all choices,&quot; as Dillon puts it, &quot;are ultimately moral choices.&quot; Jane was always precocious and adventurous: as a writer, independent and ambitious. Her letters are exercises in literary precision; Dillon calls them exercises in emotional accuracy. This is where we get to see Jane's sense of herself as &quot;other&quot;--it is here that the moment for Jane Bowles stops and vibrates. She writes: &quot;As you see you will get no news from me today. . . .I prefer irrelevant detail.&quot; Later, in another letter (this time to Paul), she brilliantly closes in on the case of the isolated writer: <br> </p><p> <table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td>I am serious but I am isolated and my experience is probably of no interest at this point to anyone. . . .This problem you will never have to face because you have always been a truly isolated person so that whatever you write will be good because it will be true which is not so in my case because my kind of isolation I think is an accident, and not inevitable. . . .Not only is your isolation a positive and true one but when you do write from it you immediately receive recognition because what you write is in true relation to yourself which is always recognizable to the world outside.

Jane's reputation, such as it is at all, as an eccentric, flighty woman with a handsome prose style, is a thin description. In fact, it seems to me, she is obsessive, neurotic, demanding, spoiled and brilliant. Naturally she is these: she's adolescent. Her writing for the most part stops in her early thirties; the astonishing thing is the fact of a profound moral consciousness in her work. Her gift for paradox is even more amazing when one realizes the desperateness of her relation to the world.

Generally we are taught either that life and art are separate or that life and art are connected. For Jane there is no debate. Her brilliance and misfortune make a life and her life is tied to her situation in history. If it can be said that Gertrude Stein and Djuna Barnes &quot;escaped&quot; a particularly American constriction and found liberation and approval (for Stein, late; for Barnes, early), it may be said of Bowles that her friends admired and supported her (Libby Holman did so financially after Jane's stroke at 40), but that her reputation remains closeted among those few who have read with passion <i> My Sister's Hand in Mine: The Collected Works of Jane Bowles,</i> issued as one of the &quot;Neglected Books of the 20th Century&quot; by Ecco Press in 1978. An audience without an understanding of her materials--the unconscious, the primitive, the intuitive--might find her work hermetic, effete or quaint, and if her writing is remembered at all, it may be because it is thought of as merely &quot;odd.&quot; But this is not that hand in mine. This is: </p><table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td>They walked for a long time. The streets began to look  all alike.

After a fight with Cherifa (one of the darknesses Jane married in a subliminal life of passion), Jane suffered her stroke, and the impairment of her hand, and the problem that from neither eye could she see the right side of the visual field.

Jane is obsessed with the elemental and crystalline nature of experience, and every description, ardent, detailed, is a description of the whole. This is the magic that tortured and invited Jane in.
