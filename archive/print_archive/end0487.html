The work finds its form at these junctures. Our attention is held, as the Working Notes suggest, between babble and sense, between color and its resonance, between prayer and the rhythm of a narrative of loss, between a gash in a screen and a projection on a page, between speech and radio signal--these are the slivers occupied. In order to read or write within a transitional place, where the way to say something becomes clear only during or after the saying, vigilance and a patience for velocity, are required. In choosing to use the page as a landing strip--site of transfer--the writers in this issue insist on reading and writing between senses where smuggled-in meanings catch, on their way somewhere.<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="100" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">&#149;    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="150" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> </div><p align="justify"><div align="justify">In the same vein,    <i> &quot;Between Your House and Mine:&quot; The Letters of Lorine Niedecker to Cid Corman, 1960 to 1970, </i>  edited by Lisa Pater Faranda, from Duke University Press, 1986  . . .
