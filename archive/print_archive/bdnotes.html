It began as a recollection of the moment of betrayal upon which my adult life is founded. But autobiographical recollection quickly leads to narrative, and narrative reminds one of fiction. I found myself almost immediately attempting to write some version of the sentence as perfected by the great English women novelists of the 19th century. Shortly thereafter the piece turned into     <i>Wuthering Heights.     </i> Why? It has to do with the perfect symmetry of that book's structure (the 'mirroring'), and with the distance of the narrator's (Nelly Dean's) voice. The passionate and melancholic recollection must remain     <i>outside,     </i> storied, as all founding events must seem not so much lived as immediately seized upon by myth in order to displace them from history, but also to account for the events which arise from them. Of all events, the founding event is a fiction, static and inevitable. Whatever else     <i>A Reading     </i> may be, it is not fiction. It is in this sense that     <i>Wuthering Heights     </i> is out of place within     <i>A Reading.</i></p><hr><p align="left"><a HREF="dahlen.html">go to the text</a></p><p align="left"><a HREF="1086.html">go to this issue's table of contents</a>        </p><hr><p align="center">  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object></p></td></tr></table></body></html><p><p><p><p><p><p>
