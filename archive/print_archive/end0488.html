The emphasis on place, placement, in this work is consistent. An idea as a pattern or plan or place: using the space on the page as a camera uses light--as punctuation and abbreviation. She is not the screen, or on it, she is between what Eisenstein calls &quot;the syntax of inner speech&quot; and that of &quot;uttered speech.&quot; The work in this issue insists that we dissemble words and read the alphabet as a series of caught acts--each letter a carved abbreviation, a taking of place.    <p><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="100" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">&#149;   <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="images/Vol4No4Img1.gif" HEIGHT="432" WIDTH="314"></p><p><div align="justify">The drawing on the first page of this issue is by Italian painter, photographer and printmaker Marilu Eustachio, who lives in Rome.

Nancy Bogen, an associate professor of English at the College of Staten Island of the City University of New York, surveyed the 77 full-length book reviews that appeared in      <i> The New York Times Book Review      </i>  during January, 1987, and found that 57 were written by men and only 19 by women.      <i> The New York Review of Books      </i>  was worse: 42 reviews were by men, and three by women. To improve the image of women as intellectuals--as writers, critics, and academics--Bogen has formed an organization to address these issues. Membership is open to anyone interested: women and men, writers and readers. For more information, contact Bogen at: 31 Jane Street, New York, New York 10014.</p>  <p><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="100" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">&#149;       </p></div><p><p align="justify"><b>This is the last issue of Volume IV--which means that now is the perfect time for you to resubscribe.  </b>  The focus of the next issue of   <i> HOW(ever)   </i>  will be erasure--erasure as formal technique, as subject and in its various connections to women's writing.
