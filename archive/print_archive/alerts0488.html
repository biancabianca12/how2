We can see this slippage at the phonic level, the way sounds lead to other sounds:<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">    <br>    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Demote    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Or not at all    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">To omit it.    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Not to say    <br>    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">My pet,    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">The world resembles writing.    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> </div><p><font FACE="Palatino"><p>And while sounds re-incorporate sounds, signs modulate among signs: we &quot;demote&quot; to &quot;omit&quot; to &quot;not to say,&quot; in a movement down or slippage between words. Of course, the movement involves syntactic leaps and ambiguities as well: is &quot;Demote&quot; imperative or declarative; do we &quot;omit it&quot; or not; does the world resemble writing?

In this series, we see an outdoors scene juxtaposing something natural (weeds? bare limbs of trees?) against an urban setting (buildings, a wall), with the letter &quot;A&quot; in the lower right corner. From one frame to the next, the camera seems to move ever so slightly to the left--&quot;Slippage is a property of aim&quot;--exposing what might be the letter &quot;N&quot; or &quot;M&quot; next to the letter &quot;A.&quot; It is important, however, that we see evidence not just of this scene but of the film itself, with its sprocket holes and frame dividers, evidence of the way images are produced and situations are framed.<p><font FACE="Palatino"><p>More spare and, in some senses, more &quot;lyrical&quot; than her earlier work <i> From Solids</i>  (Segue, 1983), this work calls attention to its constructedness, its formal regularity. Written entirely in quatrains (with one important exception), <i> Climate/Plus</i>  consists of the two title poems, &quot;Climate,&quot; composed of seventy-seven stanzas, and &quot;Plus,&quot; composed of seven stanzas. The book's structure, then, belies an interest in symmetry, in formal--if arbitrary--boundaries giving the illusion of unity. At the same time, however, Child breaks that frame, marring the formal symmetry with one stanza of only 2 lines fairly near the beginning of &quot;Climate:&quot;<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="10" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br>To keep track with the object we are up to<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br><img src="0.gif" hspace="10" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">          Error. <p>It seems important that there be this &quot;error&quot; in the formal structure; like the sprocket holes, it reminds us of the making of the object, the aim and its slippage. In the same way, &quot;Plus&quot; serves formally as a coda to the book, yet it resists providing that formal closure:<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><br>A figure strong incomplete<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="30" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">And unfinished <p>&quot;A good thought is a series of resonances,&quot; she says in a piece co-authored with Sally Silvers (&quot;Rewire // Speak in Disagreement,&quot; <i> Poetics Journal 4</i> , p. 71). Where a narrative structure urges toward causality, coherence, and completion, Child's work seems to challenge these concepts, to expose the arbitrary, the contradictory, the incomplete. <i> Climate/Plus</i>  is a series of resonances, partial soundings of &quot;The world people modify.&quot; <i></i> <p><font FACE="Palatino"> <i>--Lori Chamberlain</i> <p>Lori Chamberlain writes about topics in feminism and postmodern writing.
