I have learned from and had faith in varying feminist positions outside that instability whose existence and predominance have, for me, often pointed to painfully avoided silences in our own voices. This paper is guided by a desire to speak from and to that instability, from a place whose borders haven't been tested, whose terrain I at least am unfamiliar with, to learn how to create a politics that will continually move toward    the    unfamiliar,     uncomfortable,    not-yet-understood.</p><p align="justify">As a beginning, some questions:  </p><p align="justify">Underlying and organizing various feminist discursive strategies(2) (which include not only Cixous and Clément's, but also the models offered us by Irigaray, de Beauvoir, Jones and Wenzel's, and our own speaking to each other (as a class)) is the crucial question of how we think about and situate &quot;the other woman.&quot; How do we read her (in ourselves and elsewhere) deconstructively, that is, both sympathetically and critically? </p><div align="justify">Can we practice criticism without reproducing the Hegelian dialectical movement of victory, hierarchy, struggle for mastery; can we let go of the truth of the one without losing all struggle to the unmeaningful differences of humanism (flat plurality, civic equality)? A question on a double register: both political (to refuse ethnocentrism, truth-values, un-self-critical rational discourse) and psychoanalytic (how to read for/from the other in ourselves, to explore and allow for split/multiple subjectivity--refusing to reproduce the myth of the individual in our practice). To move from the other woman as object to be acted upon in order to ask this question: how does she move through and structure us, our work, our practice? How do the stories we tell about the other limit our ability to ask questions? What work/writing/effort do we choose to call political?</div><table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><font FACE="Palatino"> </td></tr></table><table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><div align="justify">As with any society, the counter-society is based on the expulsion of an excluded element, a scapegoat charged with the evil of which the community duly constituted can then purge itself, a purge which will finally exonerate that community of any future criticism.(3)</div></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><font FACE="Palatino"></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><div align="justify">If what we change does not change us we are playing with blocks.(4)</div></td></tr></table><p align="justify">Feminist theory began, in many ways, as a critique of the traditional notion of politics as applying only to those spheres which are said to organize and regulate public life: monetary and legislative. Yet in our own work the question remains troubling: is    <i> écriture feminine, </i> for example, political work? Does it count? Or is it rather &quot;self-indulgent,&quot; &quot;fun,&quot; &quot;embarrassing,&quot; &quot;inspiring but not useful?&quot; At what cost--and to whom---do we delimit our notion of the political?

If one is always bound by one's perspective, one can at least deliberately reverse perspectives as often as possible, in the process undoing opposed perspectives, showing that the two terms of an opposition are merely accomplices of each other . . .  the notion that the setting up of unitary opposites is an instrument and a consequence of making equal and the dissolving of opposites is the philosopher's gesture against that will to power which would mystify her very self.(5)</div></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><font FACE="Palatino"></td></tr></table><div align="justify">The preceding web of questions has led me to ask more specific and perhaps more useful questions.

Privileging the acts of writing and speaking creates a hierarchy where those of us who have always known how to speak may be pitted against those who are struggling to learn what they don't already know. Learned as a child for survival, born of psychic pain: the university rewards me for endlessly repeating what I already know how to do, to speak well and speak the same, telling the same story again and again.</p><p align="center">&#149;     </p><blockquote><p align="justify">So long as one does not question the overall functioning of the psychoanalytic discourse, and even of all theoretical discourse--even unconsciously--one only guarantees the continuation of the existing system.(7)</blockquote><div align="justify">Hovering outside this economy of real engagement as oration are other questions, possibilities. Does argument stripped of &quot;excess&quot; silence the body, desire, need, psychic pain? And when are our theories mirror images of the repressed? (Can I ask this without risking a pop psychology reduction of the desire for change?) Why theory? A painfully inadequate response to the use/abuse of our bodies and minds? --Or the fierce desire to interrupt histories of abuse? Could the inscription of excess--writing the body--that Cixous and others engage in be useful as a model in a classroom as a means by which to speak as well as write differently? </div><p align="justify">Institutionalizing a classroom where students are credited for speaking has been decades (at least) in the making. Indeed, most of us had to endure years of imposed silence in grade school before proving ourselves capable of intelligent discussion. The history of the silencing of women is even fiercer: tongues cut out of mouths, bodies burned, clitoridectomies, and more recently an entire industry of psychoactive drugs (prescribed primarily to women by doctors other than psychiatrists). I am grateful to the struggles that have provided me with a structure that allows (if not enables) women to speak: my concerns are in no way meant to deny or simplify this history. Yet as structures, systems, relations of power change, I (we?) must continue to question even that which is ostensibly organized in our best interests.</p><p align="center">&#149;     </p><p align="justify">When, where does speaking become privileged over silence, and when do we finalize that into a fixed hierarchy? Silence as oppression, pain, refusal, denial of our voices--of course: yet could silence, too, be a particular strategy, a form of struggle    <i> in some instances?    </i>  Through silence, I choose how I participate in the construction of difference--a method, perhaps, to dislodge, disorient, those conversations (written, spoken, and other) in which I am already positioned    <i> against,    </i>  given no choice other than opposition;</p><table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><div align="justify">And the movement whereby each opposition is set up to make sense is the movement through which the couple is destroyed. A universal battlefield. Each time a war is let loose. Death is always at work.(8) </div></td></tr></table><p align="justify">The choice of silence is also a method: it circumvents the economy wherein my ability to speak becomes an opportunity to oppress, de-value, silence those who have had to learn other skills to survive. &quot;. . . it is women's silence, their silent bodies . . .  which regulates the smooth exchange between men.''(9)     And if I continue to tell the same story, the story of sameness, stagnation, eternity, death, am I not producing a more devastating silence? A new form of silence? A refusal, then, to find/create myself, my theories, my practice and politics, in what I already know and already know how to say.</p><p align="justify">What could we learn from a practice of listening? Listening to inhabit the other within, listening to hear the other in the other. Learning to listen differently (listening to learn differently) to the other within, elsewhere, in the other, here. Creating a subjectivity whose remembering is enabled by a continuous return to listening. If &quot;it is possible to hear what can't be spoken,''(10)     could we learn to love our listening selves as abundantly productive? </p><p align="justify">Is it possible to create identities as a listening subject (a subject who (always) already knows how to speak) yet not that of the analyst--to disrupt transference, to listen without being the subject-who's-supposed-to-know?</p><p align="justify">To listen as a way of speaking-being? (and I remain haunted by the possibility that there is a point at which what one knows, needs to learn, and needs to communicate cannot be represented in language (or elsewhere) without a terrific violence to possibility itself.)<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></p><p align="center">&#149;<table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><div align="justify">One would have to listen with another ear, as if hearing an &quot;other meaning&quot; always in the process of weaving itself, of embracing itself with words, but also of getting rid of words in order not to become fixed, congealed in them.

What would it look like? How would it feel? (Have Cixous and Irigaray given us a taste of this already?)
