I can't help but remember what people have said to me and I find myself trying to figure out why they said what they did, without allowing myself to invent. When my prose poems are more internal they still seem to be based on a conversation-one I am having with myself--an exchange which is very tiring until one side, at least, is stated clearly. Why I am unable to express myself in the broken lines of poetry is something about which I can only theorize. I feel an urgency to make sense. It is the urgency (not the sensibleness) that demands prose. I may be too impatient for that unpunctuated pause at the end of a line.</p>  </div><hr><p> <p><p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="images/Vol3No1Img1.gif" HEIGHT="182" WIDTH="494"></p> <p><font FACE="Palatino"> <table><tr><td><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td>   </td></tr></table><table><tr><td><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td> <div align="left"><br>            <br>    Kilarney Clary<br>    <br>      <b>SUPPOSING IT DIDN'T, excerpts   </b> </div></td>  </tr></table><table><tr><td><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td>  </td></tr></table><table><tr><td><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td><div align="left">The wind stopped for a moment at the end of autumn and twilight; a woman called across the yards to her young son, toward the bluing trees, tired faces of workers who glimpsed the moon beginning.

Cold business suits of tired men after airplanes from San Francisco mostly. Something for them to eat too and fewer stars. Awful lights, corridors, ugly ceilings. Gloom, spirited in comfort hills.
