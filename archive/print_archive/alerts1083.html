In &quot;Disclaimer of the Person,&quot; an &quot;I&quot; riddles its way into self-definition: &quot;I am a woman. / I am not the sun which multiplied, / I am the moon which singled. / I am not the moon but a singling.&quot; A relentlessly singular female voice carves through language into naming-as-being: &quot;I am I. / I am my name. / My name is not my name. / It is the name of what I say. / My name is what is said. / I alone say. / I alone am not I. / I am my name. / My name is not my name, / My name is the name.&quot;</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">Comparisons with Gertrude Stein come to mind, yet the association is misleading. Joyce Piell Wexler, who has written the first book about Riding, explains the difference: &quot;While Stein wanted to break down the historical associations of words to make language a neutral medium like paint or stone, Riding wanted to destroy the personal associations of words to make language a medium for the universal.&quot; The person, the persona, the personal are whittled down to the irreducible minimum, disclaimed, even discarded, so that poetry may attain to truth through the accuracy of its language. No emotion, no lyricism, above all, no confessions.</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">During the '20's and '30's, when she reigned over modernist poetry circles in New York, London and Majorca, Riding believed that &quot;to go to poetry is the most ambitious act of the mind.&quot; (W.H. Auden called her &quot;the only living philosophical poet.&quot;) Yet she renounced poetry as mendacious c. 1940 and withdrew from print into the parenthesis of a private life. Riding left Robert Graves, her companion and disciple of many years, to marry Schuyler B. Jackson, definitively displacing her personal name.</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">This disappearing act puzzles us more than forty years later. Riding gave an account in the &quot;Preface&quot; to her  <i>Selected Poems:  </i> she said that she renounced poetry because of &quot;something poetry fails to be--belying its promissory advertisement of itself.&quot; Poets failed to see &quot;the problem of poetry as a problem in the field of language&quot;; they exalted the technicalities of &quot;craft&quot; over the difficulties of &quot;creed.&quot; Like children entranced with gaudy toys, such poets fell in love with poetry's sensuous appeal and forgot its mission to attain to spiritual truth.</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">Already in 1930, Riding called  <i>poet </i>   &quot;a lying word,&quot; using the deliberate prose of a seer: &quot;It is a false wall, a poet: it is a lying word. It is a wall that closes and does not.&quot; One must &quot;stare the wall through now, well through&quot; to a poem that is &quot;a written edge of time.&quot; In  <i>Selected Poems, </i> Riding included work that strives toward such an extreme, that suggests a &quot;something after&quot; the traditional consolations of poetry.

Many will find her austere, perhaps even &quot;appallinglybleak&quot; (Louis MacNiece), yet her linguistic combat offers an alternative to blatant confessionalism and a cure for facile poetics.

The review begins with a fantasy that the work of the major male writers of that period is out-of-print and inaccessible by way of illustrating what has been, in fact, the case with the women writers. His statement that &quot;feminists have ignored the modernist women writers as blissfully as the men have&quot; is, however, simply not true. The only evidence that Rasula offers for this judgment is the comment of an English professor's &quot;female colleague on the appearance of the two recent books on H.D. She seemed uninterested, and pressed for a response, dismissingly said 'H.D., oh, she's a man's poet.' &quot; This woman's lack of interest in H.D. is fortunately not typical of literary feminists generally. If there is a renaissance of women writers, feminist scholars, poets, novelists and serious readers have helped to create it. A glance at the publishing record of feminist scholars will confirm this.</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">As for the unnamed &quot;female colleague&quot; Rasula cites, I would propose this: on a certain page in  <i>Love's Body, </i> Norman O. Brown asks, &quot;Who is my real mother? It is a political question.&quot; It is a man's question, and perhaps now also a woman's.    </font><p><font FACE="Palatino"> <i>--Beverly Dahlen</i> </font><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Palatino"> ° </font></p><div align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">Looking at the bookshelf above my typewriter, I find a number of works on modernists written by women scholars over the past decade: Susan Stanford Friedman's ground-breaking essay &quot;Who Buried H.D.?&quot;, <i>College English,   </i> 1975; Marjorie Perloff's chapter on Gertrude Stein in    <i>The Poetics of lndeterminacy,    </i> Princeton U.

Some other magazines featuring work on women modernists by women scholars include:  <i>Signs, Massachusetts Review, Truck  </i> and  <i>Sagetrieb. </i> Over the last decade of Modern Language Association meetings, one has had the privilege of hearing an increasing variety of papers on the modernist women by women scholars--many feminist-identified, some not. Long in-the-works is Barbara Guest's forthcoming biography,  <i>Herself Defined: H.D., the Poet and her Work, </i> due from Doubleday, spring 1984. Carolyn Burke has been working for several years on a critical biography of Mina Loy.  <i>Poetics Journal  </i> 4, winter 1984, will focus on &quot;Women and Modernism,&quot; with articles on individual authors as well as related esthetic questions, by Lyn Hejinian, Susan Howe, Carla Harryman, Leslie Scalapino, Abigail Childs, Susan Laufer, Francoise Larocque, Johanna Drucker, Sally Silver, Ellen Zweig, Beverly Dahlen, Kathleen Fraser and Carolyn Burke.</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">All in all, this adds up to a rather solid indication of scholarly interest and labor. The question remains: will the works cited above be incorporated into traditional institutional reading lists, where new readers and writers are initiated into what is important? We know that some of this new scholarship is being taught in Women's Studies programs throughout the country, as an alternative to the status quo. At best, that leaves the situation a segregated one.</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">Rasula has pointed out that these &quot;great modernist women writers&quot; were prominent in their own day, publishing &quot;on the order of 150 books&quot;--making it remarkable and suspect that until the last few years these works have been unavailable to be taken seriously. If he is truly interested in encouraging further critical study of women modernists, it seems a rather shop-worn and ultimately diversionary tack for him to trot out the traditional &quot;j'accuse,&quot; chiding feminists for ignoring their own--especially given his limited research. From whom does he think the sudden demand for reprints and critical studies of modernist women has come? Isn't it more to the point to examine the power structures underpinning the making of a canon? Would Pound's  <i>The Cantos  </i> or Eliot's  <i>Four Quartets  </i> still be read, if they hadn't been seriously and thoroughly taught? Or, turning it around,  <i>could </i> they have been taught, if the editors of American literature textbooks and poetry anthologies--predominately male, during the '30s, '40s and '50s--hadn't chosen their work as &quot;major&quot;? Would younger scholars have been adding to the growing body of criticism  <i>without  </i> these texts to alert their attention? It seems easy to forget that particular individuals with concrete esthetic criteria decide what work is significant enough to  <i>sustain  </i> in print. These far-reaching judgments include personal responses of recognition and pleasure, as well as ideas of relevance and excellence. Between 1925 and 1965, who were the individual editors, publishers and critics exercising these literary choices? How many women were  <i>there, </i> among the ranks of the powerful? </font><p align="left"><font FACE="Palatino">-- <i>Kathleen Fraser </i> </font><hr><p><font face="Palatino"><a HREF="1083.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a></font></p><hr> <font face="Palatino"><a name="lisa"></a>excerpts from Lisa Pater Faranda's letter  <div align="left"><b>RE: LORINE NIEDECKER   </b></div> <b></b> </font><p align="justify"><font face="Palatino">I was moved from Niedecker's poetry to her life, a life I learned was devoted to poetry for no more important reason than survival. The principle of &quot;enough&quot; governed LN's vision and underlies her &quot;condensery&quot;. . . . For Niedecker, such economy was clearly     more than poetic technique; it was a physical, psychological and moral necessity. . . for the woman who had grown up on Blackhawk Island, a place intimately connected to &quot;the soft / and serious-- / Water&quot;, writing poetry was the means to &quot;float&quot; or &quot;fly&quot;, and she employed images of both to characterize the act itself. She learned to condense, to: &quot;be alone / Throw it over--/ all fashion / feud&quot; . . . because the poetry was enough, &quot;enough to carry [her] thru&quot;. . . . </font><p align="justify"><font face="Palatino">To many it seems as though Niedecker sacrificed much to achieve such a precious balance. Ironically, she remained isolated from the established centers of literary activity in order to write the poetry of the American idiom and modern experience. She was, nonetheless, always alert to the &quot;fashion and feud&quot; of the literary world; she tells Cid Corman in a letter of 12 December 1964  that when she was eighteen and still reading Wordsworth, she &quot;was vaguely aware that the poetry current (1921) was beginning to change.&quot; She was, in fact, a contributor to such avant-garde journals as <i>New Democracy,      </i> and contributed along with Pound and William Carlos Williams, to the first annual edition of      <i>New Directions . . . .      </i> Zukofsky first published LN in      <i>A Test of Poetry,      </i> in which he placed &quot;There's a better shine&quot; in the section called Recurrence. According to LN, she did not introduce herself to LZ until six months after February <i>Poetry, </i>(1931),      when she finally worked up enough courage to write him. By this time Zukofsky was back in New York, so contrary to many people's claim, LN did not work with Bunting and Zukofsky in Madison, Wisconsin. In the letters to Cid Corman, Niedecker describes her meeting with Bunting in 1967. She saw herself &quot;on the periphery&quot; of the Objectivist movement, and while she maintained a warm and affectionate correspondence with Zukofsky, she developed her art on the delicate line where individual imagination and culture meet . . . . </font><p align="justify"><font face="Palatino">At bottom, it is LN's ability to make me engage the words, experience syncretism and the associative power of language that I find thrilling.
