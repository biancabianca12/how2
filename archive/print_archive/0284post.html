Silence. The silence went on, while I felt as if one of those tapes of the weather they show on television were running through me, clouds covering the sun, shedding rain and dispersing in seconds. What of this kind of experience do I find in the poems in  <i>HOW(ever)? </i> Recognitions of times and locations traditional concepts say are false--and erase. Words are there and we are connected by them, living substance in a large body. O/what? Everyone? Yes, of all, &quot;of the parentage of mineral, vegetable, animal.&quot;</font><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">Thanks for putting out  <i>HOW(ever)--</i>Thanks  to all of you.

(incurring Jed Rasula's notice mainly because he prefers the occult to the feminist lens for looking at H.D.'s work). This book of Friedman--subtle and encompassing--is THE place for readers of H.D. to begin--and linger.  </font></div><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"> <i>--Rachel Blau DuPlessis, </i> Temple University</font><hr><p align="left"><a HREF="0284.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a></p><hr><p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino"><a name="jmpost"></a>Thanks for </font><font FACE="Palatino"> &quot;Amelia Earhart,&quot; Maureen Owen's work-in-progress.
