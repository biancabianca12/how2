What I was getting at in my Working Notes was how the constant interruptions of the kids have a lot to do with shaping my poems. I don't know if     I said it quite clearly because they all kept coming into my study w/ something for me to do and I fell asleep at my typewriter again after all that. Now it's midnight &amp; I'm awake tho I sometimes wonder if I'm ever really awake these days! Fanny (Howe) was saying to me last week as we cooked dinner for our ravenous brood, that she saw constant masks over Void in my poems. But the masks or disguises are not so conscious really, so tho what excites me is the mystery in my poems, I can't say that's 'consciously' part of my working plan.&quot;</p>  </div><hr align="JUSTIFY"><div align="justify">  <p>go to<a HREF="moamelia.html"> the text</a></p>  <p><a HREF="1083.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a>    </p></div><hr><p>  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object></p></td></tr></table></body></html><p><p><p><p><p><p>
