Minh-ha's extensive polycultural/semantic body of work moves beyond the range of the excerpts and responses in this issue. What we hope for is an active signpost toward the many loci of her explorations where literary theory, anthropological heuristics, poetry, film-making are not split into academic hegemonies. Trinh Minh-ha's project is profoundly non-dualistic, privileging neither text vs (visual) semiotic, creative vs critical process. There are many ways for us to enter--as readers, viewers, co-constructors. The pleasure of this complex encounter keeps us alert    <i>--&quot;Why not go and find out for yourself when you don't know? Why let yourself be trapped in the mold of permanent schooling and wait for the delivery of knowledge as a consumer waits for her/his supplier's goods?

Layers of identity and difference appear and circulate. Words and images interact, sometimes showing faith in thought(s), sometimes pressing forth an interpretation (as ownership/in arrangement and correspondence), always beautiful in the deliberate finding of that likeness already there, wonderfully unfolding, brought to mind. A text deliberating (and wandering through wonder, to liberate it): attending to exploring the possibilities of my responses sketched by the beam of project(or) in dark, filmic spaces, a rhythm courses, a sensation: &quot;The people who relate to each other.&quot; (NS) </div><div align="justify">  <p><i>Naked Spaces--Living Is Round      </i>  open(s to) sight sound earth body identity difference : the production of knowledge (Thought/Dwelling) theory text culture. The text represents a series;       <i> Naked Spaces       </i> is voices brought to mind. Film - Book : the objects around me fold in two when told by one. Which place? Whose voice? East   African  West. One field and green spear or underfoot and ground, a bringing (forth/down) of voices, sun and thought patternings (to dwell); painted thoughts of how much life connecting inner and outer spaces (what (is) suffering, for instance) by land. What makes the heart sing: and the spinning of (a) yarn? &quot;The bobbin, which is wound off in spinning, is the sun rolling in space.&quot; (NS) </p>  </div><div align="justify">  <p>I remember ((in) a circle of) elements. An echo forms: with all that matter is, and all that matters. I paint the Earth (and) Land on it. I think of faults and fault lines. Write the body life : Pense/Response--on what grounds? Trinh T. Minh-ha tells stories that shift. &quot;You ask me : 'what is the use of these paintings?' They help the plants to grow / They promote germination.&quot; (NS) </p>  <p>The shifting (of) voices without grounding of voices is set against the visual covering grounds of African living. Chasms of interpretation arise. Connections charm. Between the represented (chosen) dwellings &amp; thoughts (&quot;on what grounds&quot;: patterns of belief ), and perhaps as well between film &amp; viewer in the reception/construction of the text. </p></div><p><font FACE="Palatino"><div align="left"><img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">--Bonnie Sparling    <br>    <img src="0.gif" hspace="175" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> </div><p><div align="justify">(NS) refers to Trinh Minh-ha's film    <i> Naked Spaces--Living Is Round,</i> 1985, &quot;a feature film on the poetics of space--women, houses, cosmos--in West Africa.&quot; Script available in <i> Cinematograph    </i>  3, 1988.

When she throws her voice up into the air--there is always something very corporeal that is being described--and at the same time the words are taken from silence as matter, silence is matter. . . .
