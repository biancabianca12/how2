In this issue, <i>HOW(ever)  </i> moves production from San Francisco to Iowa City; our editors shift. Central axes (maps of the known world) are radically encountered and re-placed in work such as Trinh T. Minh-ha's where &quot;the female identity enclosure&quot; is unbuilt &amp; reassembled in language dwelling.</p><p align="justify">For us, &quot;Shifting Ground&quot; echoes an overlay of dislocation /evolving placement. Which language to speak? Which lineage to claim through our literal &amp; literary mothers? Facing the quicksand issues of &quot;home&quot; &amp; native tongue and where to place our selves, our work-- <i>HOW(ever)      </i> tracks where women write [into] words, resisting closure, borders--retelling history, the site of the imagination as it constructs/interrogates. A ground made through exchange.
