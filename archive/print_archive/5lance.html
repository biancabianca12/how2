Presenting this statement to find the person to speak to. Some parts of a photograph jump out at you &amp; the others are flat. My work is private &amp; contained. Don't attempt to make a conception of what I do, because pleasure is beyond daily rendering. Later as a result of hard work, central placement might suggest flowering prisms or the flaw of respectability. Who am I? An exile, a woman inside the passionate force. <br>     <br>     We now proceed to the plot, its abode, the need to awaken each moment to music. . .  that creation is built on nothing. . .  the formula to forget tired feet. <br>         <br>     People want to go to houses that are pretty; my chairs, the wastebasket are dirty, patched things. Someone is judging me through the mess. <br>         <br>     I could move away from oblique edges. Work myself to the center &amp; experience the intensity. We need a determinate sentence. (Everyone is trying to escape.) <br>     <br>     The young need me &amp; I need the old. Often a detail eludes me, causing trouble. People regress into doorways. (The state of things being more interesting than their condition.) Sometimes I am desperate, staying in all day with these feelings. <br>     <br>     Leaving our caverns for a predetermined point as sentries. Refusing to be different--this is what we are &amp; place ourselves in--not arrogant, seeking redemption. <br>     <br>     No desire to talk to him, selfish &amp; obtrusive bully. Enjoying his company precludes telling him the truth. Go on, get out of here. I thought I could get away from your voice among the plants of my living room, all flowing into my bedroom. (When I abandoned the inner dialogue, the heresy subsided.) <br>     <br>     Food corrupt &amp; the afternoon empty. I continue to think of him (myself). Think of another, my lover. What a lot of treasures are stored in this room. <br>     <br>     The drama of fall plays itself out. This is the directive: voice, measure, a dance, or a song. <br>         <br>     Peace to you &amp; love. That was what was unfolding: the communal. Often I lie in bed all day encountering a change. Out there I thought &quot;stay with me,&quot; but I couldn't say it. <br>     <br>     <br>     <br>  </p> <p align="justify"><font FACE="Palatino">  <b>Jeanne Lance</b>  co-edits  <i>Gallery Works </i> and lives in Bronx, N.Y.
