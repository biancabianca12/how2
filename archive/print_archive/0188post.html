Bowles includes Bogan's censored poems (those she didn't publish or those she chose to republish in her final, tiny collected volume of poems,    <i> The Blue Estuaries)  </i> as well as the letters and reviews Bogan wrote about the subject &quot;woman poet.&quot; She shows how Bogan distanced herself from the tradition of the &quot;wailing poetess&quot; of the 19th century, asserting that woman could be as controlled in poetry as man. Bowles shows that while Bogan wanted to be known as a Poet, not a woman poet, her subject matter was inevitably female subject matter. Her ambivalences, typical of her time, led to a halt of poetic creativities in her forties. &quot;It is difficult to say what a woman poet should concern herself with as she grows older, because women who have produced an impressively bulky body of work are few,&quot; she wrote in a scathing review of Edna St. Vincent Millay, suggesting that, &quot;a woman, like a man, should be able to withdraw more and more . . . her own personality from her production. . . .&quot; Ironic that these prophecies became the dagger aimed at her own undoing. Gloria Bowles shows how Louise Bogan, paradoxically, added to the wealth of the female tradition, writing some of our intensest lyrics about the female experience--sometimes despite herself, despite her theories of limitation.</p><p align="left"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--Rena Rosenwasser </p><hr><p align="left"><a HREF="0188.htm">go to this issue's table of contents</a></p><hr><p align="center">  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object></p></td></tr></table></body></html><p><p><p><p><p><p>
