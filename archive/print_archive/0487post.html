It would be great if--and then another dream, too. Dreams of a place that's like this place but a lot different and very similar. And there are footnotes and the story begins.<p>   Bernadette Mayer's friend Grace (to whom the book is dedicated) has just come back from a trip to the future--she went, was taken, to see and people were flying and singing and this book is the story of what it was like there and how things were different and what we can do without. I mean 25 years from now a lot of things are changed. Like landlords who are kept by tenants as kinky sex slaves because otherwise it would be boring to pay rent. And the James Watt Prison Center, based in a former church in the South Bronx, houses the &quot;most famous American hoods: Haig, Reagan, Coors, Kissinger, Goldwater, Nixon, et al.&quot; And &quot;[o]ddly, all the ex-publishers &amp; ad-people have now become approximately 12 inches high as human beings and in their entertainments they cavort about a large table like rodents. . . .&quot; Oh, yes, and there's world peace and the word genius was changed to &quot;everything,&quot; the word generosity was changed to &quot;grace,&quot; the word cooperation was changed to &quot;something,&quot; and the word honesty was changed to utter sound but the word truth was left alone.<p>   The footnotes on such subjects as utopian chairs and care of the sick are signed by other people, as though written by others or by Bernadette in the name or style of those others. We don't know for sure and it doesn't matter because none of what's written in this book is about owning certain words. Instead it's about how the words are all of ours and we can make the meanings, too.<p>   Mayer has written a book of prose/poetry/words/songs/wisdom/sense--maybe the next edition will come with a music cassette or a video?<p>   My two favorite sections of the book are &quot;Total World Wide&quot; the long poetry piece which is one of &quot;Two Notes on the World Government,&quot; and &quot;Homage to Jonathan Swift,&quot; a story about the language of the past/present and its protectors.<p><img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">&quot;Total World Wide&quot; is a lyric piece which considers the joy and possibility of peace.

She discovers that decades before this enclave of men had created a scheme against speaking about any emotion. Now communication with them is virtually impossible, although they do manage to communicate with each other.<p>   All in all, <i> Utopia</i>  involves much of the best of what Mayer does--her humor, her poetry, her exploration of &amp; experimentation with language. Often while reading it I laughed out loud. And what better way to start the future than by laughing about language?

My unfinished checklist of its misattributions, omissions, transcription and documentation errors runs to over 35 typed pages. So far, two reviews have registered alarm and drawn attention to its errors: Eliot Weinberger in <i> Sulfur,</i>  16, pp. 148-154, and myself in <i> Sagetrieb,</i>  5, no. 2 (Fall, 1986), pp. 139-151.<p>  The editor's haste and defective acquaintance with Niedecker's poetry and archive are signals, I fear, of his low regard for her work. Patronizing statements from the introduction offer little reassurance:  <table><tr><td><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="15" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"></td><td>The early letters to Zukofsky are those of a daughter writing to a father, a fledgling poet to a mentor. </td></tr></table><p>The earliest surviving letter from Niedecker to Zukofsky is dated May 18, 1941.

And when one has in mind a fledgling and a naif, then responsible scholarship begins to seem superfluous. Guesswork and hearsay will do. Niedecker's poetics of tact, deference, and authorial effacement has led more than one of her commentators to dismiss her work as slight. <i> From This Condensery</i>  doesn't make quite the same mistake, but it certainly doesn't affirm her stature as it should.<p><font FACE="Palatino"><img src="0.gif" hspace="6" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Since it could be many years before the collection is replaced, Niedecker scholars are warned to view its version of her work with scepticism.<img src="0.gif" hspace="4" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><img src="0.gif" hspace="226" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">--Jenny Penberthy<br> <p><p>Jenny Penberthy lives in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.
