To counter the usual presentation of a translation as given, as a &quot;normal&quot; artifact without trace of its transfiguration across borders of culture or history.  </p><p align="justify">The slippery tow of water rushed in everywhere, undoing efforts to direct this issue. Not a search for &quot;definitive&quot; rendering. More of a giving over to the backwash from one shore to another: from text to reader, from the read to the written -- arriving at translate as transfigure, (trance &amp; figure, water and ground). Crossing over or falling into the gaps -- brokeness opening form. </p><p align="justify"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--M.S.<p align="justify">Encountering the transformative energy behind translation: forms &quot;hybridized&quot; (see Marlatt); painting not described but transfigured through language; specific discourse displaced, reinvented (e.g. philosophical enquiry crossing over to lyric); the unspeakable brought to the point of utterance.<p align="justify">Norma Cole's recent translation of  Danielle Collobert's <i>It Then,</i>  along with Beverly Dahlen's review of this work forthcoming in <i> Sulfur </i> 26, strongly influenced our understanding of these issues of translation. Marlatt's &quot;revisioning of beauty&quot;, the translation of rebel to &quot;re-belle&quot; and Finch's dismantling and regaining the sonnet form also served as important points of entry into our discussion. The work in this issue enacts an active engagement with the radicalizing pressure behind translation, its power to transfigure.<p align="justify"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--M.K.<p align="center">&#149;<p align="justify">Recently published or soon to appear: Laura Moriarty's new book of poems: <i> Like Roads,        </i> Kelsey St. Press, P.O.
