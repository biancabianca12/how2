His death has occurred in the present long after that war. The context is the war.

The 'form' has become an apparatus, a device for transforming actual life and death. </p><p align="justify">I am concerned in my own work with the sense that phenomena appear to unfold.

As (spatially) infinity is all around one, it creates a perspective that is socially democratic, individual (in the sense of specific) and limitless. </p><p align="left"><i><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--Leslie Scalapino    </i>       <br>      <img src="0.gif" hspace="250" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> </p><p><div align="justify">Leslie Scalapino, editor     <i>of O Books,    </i>  has recently published    <i> The Return Of Painting    </i>  (Dia Art) and    <i> Way    </i>  (North Point).

For this reason, I believe, the urgency behind her work is not just intellectual and aesthetic but also moral. In looking for the fine structure hidden within disorderly streams of data, she is also looking for the ways in which a poet's local intervention might avert global disaster. This ambitious project is a consequence of her understanding of the manner in which small scales intermesh with large. &quot;Sensitive dependence on initial conditions&quot; suggests that poets in wartime are not &quot;useless&quot; or &quot;pathetic,&quot; for the stroke of a poet's pen might change the course of the world. If to a scientist like Lorenz the Butterfly Effect meant that even the most informed forecast is speculative, to an artist like H.D. the Butterfly Effect means the possibility of metamorphosis. This is the nonscientific but nonetheless fervent hope that gives her search for recursive structures its distinctive energy and edge. </p><p><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--from <i> Science and The Mythopoetic Mind</i>  in <i> Chaos</i>    <i>and Order</i>  edited by N.

I would like to ponder the way of the artist in a time of war by exploring the mixture of feminism, politics, and mysticism in a long poem H.D. clacked out on an antiquated typewriter in the flat she shared with Bryher. First called the War Trilogy and then, more simply, <i> Trilogy,</i>  this poem can be interpreted as. . . a warning, a command, an incitement to conserted action. To read a lyric sequence as a signal is to insist that a poem not only <b> means</b>  but <b> does.</b>  Instead of emphasizing the intricacies of the poem's signifying structures, I would like to foreground the work it performs, for whatever its nuances of meaning -- and they are many and strange -- it labors to create a formal break with everyday life, a ritual space that invites the reader to return to, reexamine, and rearrange the <b> ethos</b>  of a community in crisis.

Unlike many other poets, Guest did not look to Stein for help with this problem; Stein did not seem pertinent to her own work. Stein, who seems even now never to have felt anything a problem but to have simply faced and given a face to all that occurred to her imagination, thus offering innumerable problems to others, should they wish to impose them upon themselves. </p><div align="justify">  <p>Light is all-important in Guest's work and in this connection one notices in her poems and in the poems of H.D. to which they seem to be related, the source of light is the image on the page toward which the viewer looks for illumination. . .</p>  <p>Guest went unerringly to the one quality in H.D. which set her apart, the quality of the surface. However reticently one may confess the meaning of her universal images to one's own eye, it is the extra, therefore the essential quality which sets H.D. apart from the broad and tedious purity of much modernism. </p></div><div align="justify">  <p>For most poets, the work of H.D. has spelled exclusivity, the influence has been toward what should      <i> not      </i>  happen; for Guest, it pointed the way to a new richness: it had not to do with specific form, but with conviction finally stripped of restraint.</p>  <p>With Guest, the inital gesture is not necessarily the basis for the composition, but a start with and against which to work. It may operate as a plot of word emphasis, or it may indicate the psychological area in which events are about to take place, or a formal preference which she will presently violate. </p></div><div align="justify">  <p>Addition by addition, the words erect a wall of space upon which to operate and linearity totally disappears.</p>  <p>Differentiations of value are created and absorbed.
