Yes there were,    they were. They were there and they were writing differently and    a few of them were chosen and did appear in the magazines for    people writing in new forms. And then several women began to make    their own experimentalist magazines. What about that? Well, they    read each other. But we hardly ever heard about their poems where    I was sitting listening. You mean in school? I mean where poems    were being preserved and thought about seriously and carried forward    as news.</p><p><font size="4" face=" Palatino"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10"></font>And the women poets, the ones you call experimentalist,  were they reading Simone de Beauvoir? Firestone? Chodorow? Irigaray?  Some were. They were reading and they were thinking backwards  and forwards. They were writing to re-imagine how the language  might describe the life of a woman thinking and changing. And  the poetry they were writing wasn't fitting into anyone's anything  because there wasn't a clear place made for it. </p><p><font size="4" face=" Palatino"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10"></font><font FACE="Palatino">They must have felt displaced. Yes, they must have.  They must have felt unreal. Unrealized. Effaced. Did they know  it? Yes, they knew it. Did they talk about it? Yes, they talked  about it. We were sitting in a writing group two years ago and  we talked about it. One year ago, we were sitting there talking  about it. Last summer, I was walking around talking to myself  about it and feeling displaced and I wrote to one of my scholar  friends and asked her about it and she said you are right. There      <i>is </i>this gap. But perhaps we don't know how to acknowledge  something, how to think about something, unless it resembles what  was already there. I thought of Dickinson. I thought of Stein.  Woolf and Richardson. Slashes, anarchies, sentences, disruptions.  I was listening and I said to her, but if we could somehow talk to you  and tell you about us, would you be interested? Yes, she said,  I would be interested.      <br>      <img SRC="../print_archive/clear.gif" hspace="80" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">      <br>      <b>HOW(ever) </b>proposes to make a bridge between scholars  thinking about women's language issues, vis-a-vis the making of  poetry, and the women making those poems. <b>HOW(ever)</b> hopes to create  a place in which poets can talk to scholars through poems and  working notes on those poems, as well as through commentary on  neglected women poets who were/are making textures and structures  of poetry in the tentative region of the untried.</font></p><p><font size="4" face=" Palatino"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10"></font><i><font FACE="Palatino" SIZE="3">--Kathleen Fraser<br>  </font></i></p><hr><p><font size="4" face=" Palatino"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10"></font><font FACE="Palatino" SIZE="3">A vehicle for experimentalist poetry -- post-modern    if you will, to be thought of seriously as an appropriate poetry    for women and feminists. The poetry feminists usually eschew,    believing that now is the time for women to write understandable    poetry about their own lives, and with feeling, with the heretofore    undeveloped self in prominent display.</font></p><p><font size="4" face=" Palatino"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10"></font><font FACE="Palatino" SIZE="3">But the myths of a culture are embodied in its language,  its lexicon, its very syntactical structure. To focus attention  on language and to discover what can be written in other than  traditional syntactical or prosodic structures may give an important  voice to authentic female experience. Certainly one should be  read side-by-side with the other.</font></p><p><font size="4" face=" Palatino"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10"></font><font FACE="Palatino" SIZE="3">Unhappily, most feminist publications have ignored  the experimentalist work which women are writing now and have  been writing since early in the century. And unhappily, most publications  of &quot;new&quot; writing have had little interest in feminist  language issues, although some of the women who appear in them  have written brilliantly and movingly about their lives as women.  We want to publish an exception, however.</font></p><p><font size="4" face=" Palatino"><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10"></font><i><font FACE="Palatino" SIZE="3">--Frances Jaffer<br>  </font></i></p><hr><p>go to    <a HREF="../print_archive/0583.htm"> this issue's table of contents</a></p><hr><p align="center"><a HREF="../print_archive/0583.html">  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">    <param name="movie" value="../Images/navbar.swf">    <param name="quality" value="high">    <embed src="../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>  </object>  <br>    </a></p></td></tr></table></body></html><p><p><p><p><p><p>
