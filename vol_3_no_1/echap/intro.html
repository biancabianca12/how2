Thus the loopy strings that pull these fifteen writers into one net-like thing. The idea was loosely collaboration and networking, or how all the wires cross or don't, and where. the suggestion was to contribute something that floats along those lines, either in thought or in practice: image/text experiments, hybrid creatures made by two or more poets, (inter)reflections on the personal and political acts/effects of sharing and experimenting.

A special edition of fifty hand-constructed versions has been fashioned for the authors (and other readers!) as well. Print this (as an A4 document), trim the top and bottom few inches off the pages, and string or staple one side. Flip, flip, done.</p>      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p></div>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->        <div align="left"></div>      <hr />      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="section index" -->      <div align="left"><a href="index.html">Back to quickflip: a HOW2 e-chap</a></div>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->      <p align="left"><a href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a></p>      <hr />      <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../media/navbar.swf" />          <param name="quality" value="high" />          <embed src="../media/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    </div></td>  </tr></table></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
