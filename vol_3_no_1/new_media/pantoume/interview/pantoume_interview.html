It&rsquo;s about women's experience because the subject is plainly that, but it was also trying to make a point that the sex-specific label &lsquo;violence against women&rsquo; masks the fact that it's everyone's problem. That&rsquo;s a confusion I was concerned about when I showed <em>Pantoume</em> in Cambridge. I felt in a way, because of the issues it engaged, the piece risked coming across as niche. The conference was expressly on women&rsquo;s writing, and to show <em>Pantoume</em> in such a gender-specific context felt tricky since it deals with a set of issues that I think belong to both men and women. </div></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="left" valign="top" nowrap="nowrap">MM: </td>          <td align="left" valign="top"><div align="justify">That&rsquo;s the strength of the piece.

It&rsquo;s just trying to work through the issue. I had nothing to do with the writing so I feel able to say this. It&rsquo;s a very honest piece of work and it doesn&rsquo;t have any pretensions, which is why I think it&rsquo;s powerful. There&rsquo;s also a difference between talking about violence and talking about violence against women, because [the latter] has such a glorified and specific historical background. There&rsquo;s this book from the 1970s called <em>Against Our Will</em> by Susan Brownmiller, which is just all about rape. It&rsquo;s basically 500 pages of gratuitous case studies, endless case studies through history&hellip;and violence, it&rsquo;s seen as a completely separate thing, for some reason.

I run workshops for the East Side Educational Trust, and this one in particular I co-ran with artist/writer Ceri Buck. We were working with teenagers, and the subject was creative speechwriting. It consisted of a week of full day sessions, and built into the workshop was a trip to Amnesty International. Amnesty put us through their workshop on the arms trade and gun control and introduced us to their other major campaigns, one of which fights violence against women. After we left Amnesty the group had this discussion, meant to inspire the students to write their speeches, where we went around in a circle and shared which issues we all felt most passionately about and why. Quite a lot of the students wanted to talk about violence against women, and it became clear this was an issue that they related to. The thing that really struck me, and it was something I had been thinking about for quite a while, was that as we talked we jumped between these two modes of conversation. One of them was confessional, emotional&hellip;based in personal experience or that of people we knew. The other handled statistics and facts. One was rational and controlled, and the other let people fray a bit and there didn&rsquo;t seem to be a middle ground. This seemed a real problem to me.
