Cycling through image, poetry and essay, implications that could be slipped over once haunt a reader on &lsquo;REPEAT&rsquo;. The piece simultaneously addresses the inadequacy of language and stretches the possibilities of expression to breaking point. Cold, hard statistics are a sucker punch to the reader lost in trope, and the piece succeeds in grounding itself in the political, the everyday, without employing shock tactics or taking a position of authority. <em>Pantoume</em> thinks itself through; it binds you up in its cycles. It won&rsquo;t have itself skimmed or ignored. It is a testament to the possibilities of collaboration and cross-media works, and the role art can play in prompting action and change in social attitudes. What kinds of expression are there for violence, and why? What does a gender tag have in common with a &lsquo;tender gag&rsquo;? What role does femininity play in society&rsquo;s attitude towards violence? Troubling questions addressed, readdressed and passed on to the reader. </p>      <p align="justify" class="doublespaceStandardText">These were my interests after exploring the piece, and a lot of this ground is covered in my interview with Fierle-Hedrick and Morris. What I took from our discussion and from the piece was a serious challenge: to find an appropriate form and expression for violence and its consequences. I wrote <em>Sugar</em> as a response to <em>Pantoume</em> and a response to my own experience of violence as an undergraduate. Looking over my journal in the days which directly followed the event, I was struck by the volume of writing I had produced in that time, and how little of it referenced the attack. I seemed to lack a language of my own to describe the experience. I had instead written obsessively out of novels, poetry, films and songs, producing pages and pages of transcribed text. I tried to work between all of this, my account (written much later) of the actual attack, and language (or silence) which would form a kind of dialogue between <em>Sugar</em> and <em>Pantoume</em>. <em>Sugar</em> is included in this section as a working-through of the ideas discussed in the interview and in <em>Pantoume</em>. </p>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->        <div align="left"></div>      <hr />      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="section index" -->      <div align="left"></div>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->      <p align="left"><a href="../../../index.html">Table of Contents</a></p>      <hr />      <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../../media/navbar.swf" />          <param name="quality" value="high" />          <embed src="../../../media/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    </div></td>  </tr></table></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
