						<h5><font color="#ff9966">The challenge becomes with what language can we convey such personal violence, with what words bear its experience, spawn a communal speech towards its eradication.&nbsp; This is neither to laud resorting to the bleak alienation of confession, nor to draw on the amputation of abstraction, but rather is a bid to somehow forestall the loss of what is daily and abrupt to the static endurance of an aesthetic.&nbsp; How to root acknowledgment, faculty, accountability and action, without hunting some twin pain in the Other &#151; in the case of the text, the reader, that person whose heart and agency it works to engage.&nbsp; How to source empathy [not conflation] in light of the fact that we as general publics still do not know how to engage with our closed doors, behind which 1 in 3 women around the world are or will be affected by domestic violence in their life-time.&nbsp; Among 16-43 year old women in Europe this violence is the leading cause of death, is not inclusive of those acts staged, civic, on our streets.&nbsp; Still we re-phrase, cloak ourselves in autonomy, back-roomed, capitulate to a corral of private expression that by default rebuffs its norm, our usual suffering.&nbsp;</font></h5>
