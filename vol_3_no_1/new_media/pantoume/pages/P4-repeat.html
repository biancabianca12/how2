						<h5><font color="#ff9966">When the psyche revisits past selves it does not breathe easy.&nbsp; Too many hearts overlap our present, the body left but loose anchor, buffered by an accumulation of memory.&nbsp; A blank street is so much more immediate than this page for how it attends the stock fear of appearing &#151; by angled shoulder, swung walk &#151; too feminine.&nbsp; A target.&nbsp; The trajectory of an image shifts between knowing and not knowing. &nbsp;That night my calculated risk, my walk home, stole all.&nbsp; Each previous and potential self was packed away.&nbsp; I was quick and vehement with my lack of warning; to let any linger was to chance losing her absolutely, tip to toe.&nbsp; This: the still trauma lobbies, the web of gravel that laced my knees I knew would be an end &#151; either way &#151; to that perennial chase.&nbsp; I could not summon the habitual ferocity.&nbsp; And the only thing to do with the shock of striking home was to strip naked, to check and re-check my face in the bathroom mirror as each layer peeled away.&nbsp; As they drove beside me, as ten minutes later they parked the station wagon, took steps, they murmured: <i>you are beautiful, from where? </i></font></h5>
