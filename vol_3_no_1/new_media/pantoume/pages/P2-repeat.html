						<h5><font color="#ff9966">The conversion of humanity to image, icon, not via the proverbial gaze but via the categorisation of difference &#151; difference so profoundly threatening for it characterises equality, yet also might let us the most supreme violence.&nbsp; The more we compartmentalize, the less we demand of ourselves that essential engagement with human complexity, and rely instead on the frequent fallibility of base markers: race, gender, class, culture.&nbsp; And so following a teasing apart of one's humanity by differentiation, a person undergoes that total surgical &#151; if metaphorical &#151; recreation of the self as victim: that ultimate Other isolated even from its own society.&nbsp; My makeover was a cruel distrust of all comments on my image, and the compulsion to change that image as often as possible to trip up even the eyes of those closest to me: i.e., a year of hair oscillating between blue, purple, black, white.&nbsp; Baggy, high-necked clothes belied my dread of exposure. Where do we site the unspeakable if not in ourselves? To what effect?</font></h5>
