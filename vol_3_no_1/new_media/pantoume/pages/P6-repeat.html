						<h5><font color="#ff9966">It's the anxiety or skewed shame of voicing such events that contorts, the twist of having once appeared vulnerable, of how that vulnerability performs an enduring stigma.&nbsp; This is the complexity of re-claiming one's appearance, of speaking the past in the present.&nbsp; That night broke my faith in language to translate the self.&nbsp; Perverted by its economy, now older and hollowed, I know well how I have been full of it.&nbsp; To my &#151; <i>vai via, andate in casa, mi lasci in pace</i> &#151; they replied with English.&nbsp; Even one's own language can be refused if the need to differentiate a person is strong enough.&nbsp; For years now I have attempted to shape this sensitivity into poem, approaching that ambiguous venue as a space allowing for leeway, but it will not &#151; perhaps will never &#151; match words.&nbsp; As semiotics have insinuated, linguistic signification can exemplify negative relation, each character made meaningful by those it is <i>not</i>.&nbsp; Prose only seems to perform most explicitly &#151; by this I mean neutral &#151; this void.</font></h5>
