      <p align="justify">HOW2 has changed the way that Updates, Postcards and Calls for Submissions are published between issues, to help you keep up-to-date with information when it is uploaded.</p>
      <p align="justify">Each section now has its own blog, at the following addresses:</p>
      <p align="justify" class="TITLE2">Calls for Submissions</p>
      <p align="justify">Here you will find calls for submissions for future issues of HOW2 only.</p>
      <p align="justify"><a href="http://how2calls.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://how2calls.blogspot.com</a></p>
      <p align="justify" class="TITLE2">Updates</p>
      <p align="justify">Updates is for you to share news of events in your area with us and to help you to create an international network of events that will link How2 participants together. Please send us your details of reading series, calls for submission to journals and conferences, plus details of launches of new websites, archives etc. that you feel might be of interest to How2 readers and we will post it up.</p>
      <p align="justify"><a href="http://how2updates.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://how2updates.blogspot.com</a></p>
      <p align="justify" class="TITLE2">Postcards</p>
      <p align="justify">A chance to respond informally to the content of the How2 journal. We are interested in comments and reactions to work that you find here and encourage you to respond to and to extend the questions and debates which interest you in our latest issue and in material contained in our extensive archive. We welcome further discussions of modernist and innovative poetry by women that you feel are relevant to our concerns.</p>
      <p align="justify"><a href="http://how2postcard.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://how2postcard.blogspot.com</a></p>
      <p align="justify" class="TITLE2">Subscribe to RSS</p>
      <p align="justify">Each blog has an RSS feed. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and allows you to be informed of how many posts you have not read. Most of the latest versions of the major web browsers now support RSS. Simply bookmark the RSS feed (this should be displayed in an icon to the right-hand side of your address bar) and you will be able to keep in touch with these sections of HOW2.</p>
    <p align="justify">Although your browser probably supports RSS, you might wish to use a dedicated blog reader. Mac OS X users might wish to download <a href="http://www.utsire.com/shrook/" target="_blank">Shrook</a>. Windows users can download <a href="http://www.rssreader.com/download.htm" target="_blank">RSS Reader</a>. Both readers are freeware. Google also offers a <a href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank">free web-based RSS reader</a>. </p>
